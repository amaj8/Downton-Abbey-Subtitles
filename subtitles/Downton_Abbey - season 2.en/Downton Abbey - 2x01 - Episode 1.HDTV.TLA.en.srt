1
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,815
Here we are! You'll be all right!

2
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:49,688
Sergeant Stephens. Yes, sir.
I want every wounded man

3
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:51,967
taken down the line
before it starts to get dark.

4
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,249
We've bloody well lost enough of them
for one day.

5
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,009
When did this arrive?
This morning, sir.

6
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,128
Good news.

7
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,248
We're to be relieved today
by the Devons.

8
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,968
The men can finally get some rest

9
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,008
and I've got a few days' leave
coming to me.

10
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,488
What will you do with them, sir?
London first.

11
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:15,968
To remind myself what real food
tastes like.

12
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:18,449
Then north for a couple of days,
I suppose.

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,048
Naturally, there's a girl I want to
see while I'm there.

14
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,088
So I should hope, sir.

15
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:25,808
It's strange, isn't it?

16
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,287
To think about our old lives just
going on as before.

17
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,729
While we're here, in this.
It's more than strange.

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,768
When I think of my life at Downton,

19
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,769
it seems like another world.

20
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,488
We normally have everything done
before the family wakes up,

21
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,329
but it's all at sixes and sevens
today.

22
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,328
I'll go through it with you
tomorrow, when we're back to normal.

23
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,329
I do know how to run a house.

24
00:02:24,249 --> 00:02:26,249
Come along.

25
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,449
It goes under the epaulette.
I'm sorry, M'Lord.

26
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:34,088
If I'd known, I'd have asked
Mr Bates about it

27
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,808
before he left for London.

28
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:38,809
Because I'll be in uniform
a lot of the time, in future.

29
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,008
Does being lord lieutenant mean
you're back in the army?

30
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:44,728
Not exactly. The lord liet' is
responsible for the army

31
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,528
in the county while the war's on.

32
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,648
But, no, I'm not back in the army.

33
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:51,649
It appears they don't want me.

34
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:08,288
Morning. I don't suppose there's
any news of Bates?

35
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,209
We expect him back any day, My Lord.

36
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,848
He wrote to Anna that they had the
funeral last Monday.

37
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,608
William's a good chap, but he's not
Bates when it comes to uniforms.

38
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:18,608
I may not be a real soldier,

39
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:21,369
but I think I ought to look like one.
Quite, My Lord.

40
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,089
We don't often see you in here
for breakfast.

41
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:27,089
Isobel said she was coming up
to help

42
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,168
and your mother threatened
to look in.

43
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,369
No doubt they would love it
if they found me still in bed.

44
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,368
I don't believe it.

45
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,968
Please say it's something nice.

46
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,688
General Robertson's invited me

47
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,768
to be Colonel of the North Riding
Volunteers. This is the best bit.

48
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,528
'lt may please you to know

49
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,808
that the idea was given to me
by General Haig.'

50
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:50,888
Well if Haig's involved, it means
I'm back in the army properly.

51
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:54,248
How can that be? You were told you
weren't wanted for active service.

52
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:57,088
You can't jump in and out of the
army like a jack-in-the-box.

53
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,768
I don't see why not.
Churchill went back to the front

54
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,088
after the Gallipoli business.
If he can do it, why shouldn't I?

55
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:05,128
Sybil, are you all right?

56
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:07,168
Sybil, darling?

57
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,409
Would you excuse me.
I think I'll just...

58
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:13,289
She's had more bad news.

59
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:21,488
I do think I'm getting better,
don't you? Up to a point, M'Lady.

60
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:23,648
If you could just get the clutch

61
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:26,129
right down to the floor. But I am.
Not quite, M'Lady.

62
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,168
It doesn't seem to want to go.

63
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,328
I think it wants to,
if you ask it properly.

64
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,408
That's better.

65
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,168
You'll be putting me out of a job.

66
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,289
Won't the call up put you all
out of your jobs?

67
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:39,648
I'll cross that bridge
when I come to it.

68
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,168
What are you giving them to eat?
Not much.

69
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,248
They know the money's
for the hospital,

70
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,448
so they can't expect
Belshazzar's Feast.

71
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:51,768
I'll make some cheese straws.
What's the matter with you?

72
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,369
Nothing much.
My dad still won't let me enlist.

73
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,808
Your father has no-one but you.

74
00:04:57,809 --> 00:05:01,048
Of course he doesn't want you to
enlist. Who can argue with him?

75
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:04,928
So I stand by while the lads on the
farms and in the gardens go to war.

76
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,249
Even Thomas is at the front in the
Medical Corps.

77
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,288
Ha, that'll come as a nasty shock.

78
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,528
You can make fun of him,
Mrs Patmore,

79
00:05:11,529 --> 00:05:14,009
but he's fight for his king and
country and I'm not.

80
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,208
Well, I dare say you won't have long
to wait.

81
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,888
Well, I hope you're right.
Do you?

82
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,849
Because I don't.
I hope very much that I am wrong.

83
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:28,128
It's kind of you to let us have it
here. They'll enjoy it so much more.

84
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,688
And you can charge so much more
for the tickets.

85
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:33,888
Good morning, Mama. This is very
early for you to be up and about.

86
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,488
War makes early risers of us all.

87
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:38,609
I thought I would help with
the flowers.

88
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,368
Bassett has plenty...

89
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:44,289
but thank you.

90
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,448
You don't mind my taking over
the flowers, do you?

91
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:54,528
Cora's flowers always look more
suited to a first communion...

92
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,849
in southern Italy.

93
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,688
Well, what else have you planned
for tonight's revels?

94
00:06:01,689 --> 00:06:04,328
Anything we can think of that will
raise money.

95
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:08,129
Hot, buttered toast with a countess
at tuppence a slice?

96
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:12,369
You drop the cushions on the floor
to plump them up.

97
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:15,008
I know.

98
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:16,769
Ethel, are you settling in?

99
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:21,089
I would be... if Anna'd stop
teaching me how to suck eggs.

100
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,888
I was head housemaid
in my last position.

101
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:28,408
You were senior housemaid,
out of two, in a much smaller house.

102
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,488
Are they to come in here tonight?

103
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,288
Only at the interval. And keep them
out of the drawing room.

104
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:35,448
I thought Mr Bates would've been
back by now,

105
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:37,129
or he could've stood guard.

106
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:41,928
Who is this Mr Bates?
His Lordship's valet.

107
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:44,408
He's been in London
because his mother died.

108
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,288
Only everyone talks about him
as if her were king.

109
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:49,409
Do they? That's nice to hear.

110
00:06:49,769 --> 00:06:51,808
Anna...

111
00:06:51,809 --> 00:06:55,729
help me do battle with
this monstrosity.

112
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:59,729
Looks like a creature from
The Lost World.

113
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:10,968
You should let William do that.

114
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,008
He's got enough on his hands,

115
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:15,248
getting the uniforms out of
mothballs.

116
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,648
I must remember to put
Anna on alert for dinner tonight.

117
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,088
You have to ease up a bit or you'll
give yourself a heart attack.

118
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:26,288
There's a war on. Things cannot
be the same when there's a war on.

119
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:30,208
I do not agree. Keeping up standards
is the only way to show the Germans

120
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,328
that they will not beat us
in the end.

121
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:34,448
Well, give me some warning
the next time

122
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,729
we're expecting Germans at Downton
and I'll see what I can do.

123
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:43,888
Thank you.

124
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,529
We thought we'd come in here
for a little talk.

125
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:50,329
Well I'm sure we won't be
disturbed.

126
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,289
Please.

127
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,488
Well, the thing is...

128
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,328
I've had a letter from Matthew.

129
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,488
Of course, he doesn't tell me
what he's actually doing.

130
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:05,288
No, he wouldn't.

131
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:07,288
But I'm glad he's all right.
I miss him.

132
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:09,008
Well, that's the point.

133
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,088
You must know he's been down here
a few times since the war started.

134
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,128
We had heard.

135
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:16,288
Downton is hardly a metropolis.

136
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,488
Is he still determined to go back
to Manchester when it's all over?

137
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,768
He doesn't talk much about life
after the war, none of them do.

138
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,008
I suppose they don't want to
tempt fate.

139
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,009
Until now, that is.

140
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:32,329
He writes that he is engaged to be
married to a Miss Lavinia Swire.

141
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,408
Well... I suppose we all knew
it would happen one day.

142
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,409
Do you know her?
Not yet.

143
00:08:44,729 --> 00:08:47,688
Apparently they met when he was in
England last time.

144
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,888
It all seems rather hurried.

145
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,688
You can't blame them for wanting to
live in the present.

146
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,609
Anyway, he's been in London on leave

147
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,768
and now he's bringing her here to
meet me.

148
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,649
He'll be here tonight and tomorrow,

149
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,568
and then he leaves on Thursday,
while she stays for a bit.

150
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:04,848
So will you miss the concert?
Well, that's up to you.

151
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:08,368
We'd all hoped that he and Mary
would sort things out between them.

152
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:12,088
But if that's not to be, shouldn't
we try to get back to normal?

153
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,808
Even if he's not keen to live
in the village...

154
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:16,609
he's still the heir.

155
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,088
And you're still his family.

156
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:21,848
I quite agree.

157
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,008
We can't know if Matthew will come
through it.

158
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:27,328
Either way, I would like to see him
and I want to wish him luck.

159
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,888
The trouble is, Mary's back from
London today as well.

160
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:31,928
She gets in at five o'clock.

161
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:35,888
Matthew's driving down in Lavinia's
car, they won't meet on the train.

162
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,129
That's a relief.

163
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,768
I hate Greek drama.

164
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,208
You know, when everything happens
off stage.

165
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:47,648
But should we tell her not to come?
We might still catch her.

166
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:49,688
Isobel's right.

167
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,168
We must use this engagement
as a new beginning.

168
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,888
You bring our Lieutenant Crawley
to the concert

169
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,608
and stay for dinner afterwards.

170
00:09:56,609 --> 00:09:58,609
I was hoping you'd say that.

171
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,848
There you are. I'm just going
home, but I'll be back at four.

172
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,849
Sybil, my dear, what's the matter?

173
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:19,009
Tom Bellasis has been killed.

174
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,168
What a terrible thing.

175
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:24,169
I remember him at Imogen's ball.

176
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,649
He made me laugh out loud just as
her uncle was giving a speech.

177
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,448
Sometimes...

178
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,209
it feels as if all the men
I ever danced with are dead.

179
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:40,768
I just feel so useless,

180
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:43,848
wasting my life while they sacrifice
theirs.

181
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,888
You've been a tremendous help with
the concert. No, I...

182
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,648
I don't mean selling programmes or
finding prizes for the tombola.

183
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:54,089
I want to do a real job, real work.

184
00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:56,769
Well...

185
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:01,328
if you're serious, what about
being an auxiliary nurse?

186
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:03,247
There's a training college in York.

187
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,209
I know I could get you on to
a course.

188
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,288
It may be something of a rough
awakening. Are you ready for that?

189
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,048
I mean, have you ever made
your own bed, for example?

190
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:14,008
Or scrubbed a floor?

191
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:16,009
O'Brien, what is it?

192
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,968
Mr Platt is taking Her Ladyship and
Lady Grantham down to the village.

193
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:22,168
She wondered if you'd like to go
with them.

194
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:24,409
That's very kind. Thank you.

195
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,448
Go on, what else would I need?

196
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:30,969
Well, if you're serious,
what about cooking?

197
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,728
Why don't you ask Mrs Patmore

198
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,888
if she could give you one or two
basic tips?

199
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,727
When you get to York,
it might be useful

200
00:11:38,728 --> 00:11:40,449
to know a little more than nothing.

201
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:45,809
They want to use her as a maid of
all work at the hospital.

202
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:49,808
I suppose it's cheaper when Lady
Sybil can live here for nothing.

203
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,888
But it doesn't see quite right,
somehow, to take advantage.

204
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:54,889
No, it does not.

205
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:58,568
I hear the young men that are being
brought in now are very disfigured.

206
00:11:58,569 --> 00:12:00,608
How terrible.

207
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:02,649
Limbs missing and faces blown apart.

208
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,689
And Lady Sybil's been nurtured
so very gently.

209
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,449
And what types would she be working
with?

210
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:14,009
Still, you'll know what's best
to do.

211
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,528
Yes.

212
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,769
I certainly will.

213
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,288
Where's the butter for the pancakes?
It's in the cold larder.

214
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,729
Are we having pancakes tonight?
Are we heck as like.

215
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,048
Upstairs dinner, crepes Suzette.

216
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:36,848
I've always wanted to try those.
Could you save me some?

217
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,888
If they don't finish them all.

218
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:41,728
Save you some crepes Suzette?

219
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,049
If you don't mind.
What are we having?

220
00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:47,888
Lamb stew and semolina.
Do you eat a lot of stews?

221
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:51,408
Don't you fancy that, dear?
Not all the time.

222
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,448
I see.

223
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,048
Would you like to sleep
in Her Ladyship's bedroom

224
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,009
while you're at it?
I wouldn't mind.

225
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,168
I hate sharing a room.
I didn't in my last place.

226
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:04,528
There were only two maids
and a cook. I'm just saying.

227
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:08,529
And I'll 'just say' if you don't
look out!

228
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:13,568
You've got a cheek,
on your first day.

229
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,608
I don't see why.

230
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,968
I want the best and I'm not ashamed
to admit it.

231
00:13:17,969 --> 00:13:19,808
And you think we don't?

232
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,729
I think it's hard to change
at your age.

233
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:25,688
I don't blame you, but I suppose,

234
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:28,049
in the end, I want to be more than
just a servant.

235
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,208
I'm sorry,

236
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,288
but if Dr Clarkson needs free labour,

237
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,728
I'd prefer him not to find it in
my nursery.

238
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:47,768
But Sybil isn't in the nursery.
And in case you hadn't noticed,

239
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,568
she hasn't been there for some time.
You know what I mean.

240
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,608
Well, no, not really.

241
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:55,288
You can't pretend it's not
respectable.

242
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:59,408
When every day we're treated to
pictures of queens and princesses

243
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:04,088
in Red Cross uniform, ladling soup
down the throat of some unfortunate.

244
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:05,888
But Sybil won't be ladling soup.

245
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,248
She'll have to witness unimaginable
horrors.

246
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:11,248
When she's an innocent.
Her innocence will protect her.

247
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,569
For once, I agree with
Cousin Isobel.

248
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,049
Sybil must be allowed to do her bit,
like everyone else.

249
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,369
What about you, Molesley? Are you
ready for the call, if it comes?

250
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,288
It won't be coming for me, M'Lady.

251
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:30,208
I had a letter from the War Office
to say I'm not suitable for service.

252
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,248
Why not?

253
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:34,288
I really couldn't say, M'Lady.

254
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,488
As you can imagine, Molesley's
father is beside himself with joy.

255
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,849
God moves in a mysterious way.
His wonders to perform.

256
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:08,808
Bates, no-one told me
you were on this train.

257
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,848
They didn't know, M'Lady.

258
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,809
We'll give you a lift to the house.

259
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:43,769
Why didn't you say you were coming?
I didn't know till today.

260
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,568
Anna, I borrowed a case from
Lady Rosamund.

261
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,688
I bought some things while I was
in London. Very good, M'Lady.

262
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,728
Well, it would be our secret.

263
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,408
A surprise. You don't mind, do you?

264
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,448
It's not that I mind, M'Lady...

265
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:05,488
And I only need the basics.

266
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:07,528
How to boil an egg, how to make tea.

267
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:09,529
Don't you know how to make tea?

268
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:11,329
Not really.

269
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,208
You're right, it is a joke.

270
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,048
But when I start my course,
I don't want to be a joke.

271
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:19,529
Will you help me?
Course we will, won't we?

272
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,368
If you say so.

273
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:24,408
Let's get started.

274
00:16:24,409 --> 00:16:26,608
Do you know how to fill a kettle?

275
00:16:26,609 --> 00:16:28,769
Everyone knows that.

276
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:35,089
Not everyone, apparently.

277
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,288
When can I talk to you?

278
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:51,928
After the concert.
Outside, in the courtyard.

279
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,729
There's bound to be a gap
before they start dinner.

280
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:59,448
Are you going up for the concert?
Maybe. Can I sit with you?

281
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:01,409
Don't be daft, we've got a dinner
to make.

282
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,328
I've not got time for concerts.
I've had a letter from my dad.

283
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,807
He won't change his mind.
He says he can live with it

284
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,129
if I get called up, as there's
nothing we can do.

285
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,208
But if I enlist and anything
happens, he'll never get over it.

286
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,848
He loves you. He may love me,
but he doesn't own me.

287
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,849
And he's not being fair.

288
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,928
Glad to be back?
I'm never sure.

289
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,048
When I'm in London, I long
for Yorkshire and when I'm here,

290
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,728
I ache to hear my heels clicking on
the pavement.

291
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,288
I'd forgotten about this nightmare
concert.

292
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,729
Why didn't you warn me?
I'd have come back tomorrow.

293
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,249
But you'd have missed Matthew.

294
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:39,968
I was going to tell you.

295
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:43,288
Matthew's on leave and he's in the
village,

296
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:46,688
so Papa and I thought it would be
a good time to mend our fences.

297
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,728
He's coming tonight with Isobel.

298
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:50,689
And his fiancee.

299
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:53,928
What?
Edith...

300
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:56,289
I don't know how helpful
you're being.

301
00:17:57,489 --> 00:17:59,528
Matthew's engaged.

302
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,929
He's brought her to Downton to meet
his mother.

303
00:18:03,689 --> 00:18:05,689
Well, how marvellous.

304
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,529
You don't mind?
Why should I?

305
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,888
We're not going to marry,

306
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,608
but I don't want him to spend the
rest of his life in a cave.

307
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,409
Exactly what Papa and I feel.

308
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:19,328
Please try to be happy for him.

309
00:18:19,329 --> 00:18:22,089
Of course I'm happy.
Good luck to him.

310
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:25,568
Anyway, there's someone I want you
all to meet.

311
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:28,009
Have you ever come across
Richard Carlisle?

312
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:30,368
Sir Richard Carlisle?

313
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:32,888
The one with all those horrid
newspapers?

314
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,928
We met at Cliveden.
But how old is he?

315
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,448
Old enough not to ask
stupid questions.

316
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,648
Anyway, I can't wait for you to know
him.

317
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:43,009
If only Papa hadn't closed down
the shoot.

318
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,209
Most people have stopped shooting
now that the war's on.

319
00:18:47,809 --> 00:18:51,608
But I'm sure Papa would be happy to
have Sir Richard come and stay.

320
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:54,968
Are you? I shouldn't have thought
he was Papa's type at all.

321
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,489
Are you coming?
I'll be down in a minute.

322
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,529
Are you all right, M'Lady?

323
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,009
Anna...

324
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,328
It's awfully grand.

325
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,168
You'd better get used to it.

326
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:55,088
It'll be your home one day.

327
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:58,248
I'm not sure 'home' would ever be
quite the word to describe it.

328
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,048
My dear fellow, welcome back.
It's so very good to see you.

329
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:04,128
May I present Miss Lavinia Swire?

330
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:06,928
How do you do, Lord Grantham.
How do you do, Miss Swire.

331
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:10,448
So... that's Mary's replacement.

332
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:13,728
Well, I suppose looks aren't
everything.

333
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:15,729
I think she seems rather sweet.

334
00:20:16,689 --> 00:20:20,129
I'm afraid meeting us all together
must be very intimidating.

335
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,969
I do hope so.

336
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,608
Now, please come this way.
Thank you.

337
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:43,609
It's good to see you.

338
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:47,249
Hello, Miss Swire, I'm Mary Crawley.

339
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,128
Of course you are. I mean,
I've been longing to meet you

340
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,648
because I've heard so much about you
from Matthew.

341
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,889
That is...
Nice things, I hope.

342
00:20:56,409 --> 00:20:58,169
What else would she hear from me?

343
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:00,769
Please.

344
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:04,449
I can't say.
It's been such a long time.

345
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,928
Who knows what you think of me now?

346
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,808
I think...

347
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,529
I'm very glad to see you looking
so well.

348
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:15,368
All right, you win.

349
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:17,408
We are at peace again.

350
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,768
Have you found something nice?

351
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:47,529
Why, particularly?

352
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:51,248
As a welcome home for Mr Matthew.

353
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:53,288
What's the matter?

354
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:55,169
I'm thought you'd come round to him.

355
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,408
Last time he was here, he hadn't
broken Lady Mary's heart.

356
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:00,969
Lady Mary broke her own heart.

357
00:22:01,849 --> 00:22:04,448
That's if she has a heart to break.

358
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,008
I don't think we're ever going to see
eye to eye on this, Mrs Hughes.

359
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:10,768
She refused him when she thought
he'd have nothing.

360
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,168
And when he was heir again,
she wanted him back.

361
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,168
I thought caution was a virtue.

362
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,289
Caution may be, self interest is
not.

363
00:22:19,449 --> 00:22:22,728
Perhaps Miss Swire is a gentler
person.

364
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:25,128
If you ask me, this Miss Swire,

365
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:28,648
who, it may interest you to know,
is not to be found in Burke's Peerage

366
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,529
or Burke's Landed Gentry, has an eye
to the main chance.

367
00:22:32,969 --> 00:22:35,088
That's not snobbish, I suppose.

368
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:37,448
I like to see things done properly,
Mrs Hughes,

369
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,488
and I won't apologise for that.

370
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:41,489
Now, if you'll excuse me.

371
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,208
What is it?
A white feather, of course.

372
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,209
Coward.

373
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,328
Stop this at once!

374
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:04,328
This is neither the time
nor the place.

375
00:23:04,329 --> 00:23:07,328
These people should be aware
that there are cowards among them.

376
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:10,529
Will you please leave?
You are the cowards here, not they!

377
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:26,008
Leader, will you continue.

378
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:37,969
I'm in a uniform.
Wrong kind.

379
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:45,488
That was horrid, William.
I hope you won't let it upset you.

380
00:23:45,489 --> 00:23:47,328
No, Your Ladyship.

381
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,328
Why are these women so unkind?

382
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:51,048
Of course it is horrid,

383
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,367
but when heroes are giving their
lives every day,

384
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,689
it's hard to watch healthy,
young men do nothing.

385
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,688
By the way, Sybil, very good news,
they do have a vacancy.

386
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,768
It's very short notice,
because someone dropped out.

387
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:05,928
You'd have to be ready to start
on Friday.

388
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,889
May I ask what this is about?

389
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:11,689
Cousin Isobel has got me a place on
a nursing course in York.

390
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,769
I want to work at the hospital.

391
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:20,449
We don't have to talk about it now.

392
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,368
She just turned up at my mother's
house.

393
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:28,369
Not long before she died.

394
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:31,849
So... what does it mean?

395
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,008
I think it means, at long last...

396
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,009
I'm able to get a divorce.

397
00:24:41,449 --> 00:24:44,008
Mr Bates...

398
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,009
is this a proposal?

399
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:48,929
If that's what you want to call it.

400
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:52,249
And you might start calling me John.

401
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:58,289
Well, why are you sure she'll do it
now, when she's refused for so long?

402
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,688
Mother left me some money, much more
than I thought.

403
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:05,048
Vera's a greedy woman, she won't
refuse what I can offer her.

404
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:07,088
Will we have to leave Downton?

405
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,968
Not until we want to.
I've spoken to His Lordship

406
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:12,169
and he will find a cottage for us
near the house.

407
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:15,649
You told him you want to marry me?
I did.

408
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:18,609
Before you spoke to me?

409
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,688
You don't mind, do you?
Of course I mind!

410
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,408
In fact, I'd give you a smack

411
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:26,729
if I didn't want to kiss you so much
I could burst.

412
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:56,671
Branson says I'm ready for the road.

413
00:25:57,031 --> 00:25:58,870
That's not what he told me.

414
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:00,950
How delicious, I love these.

415
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,110
How did you and Matthew meet?

416
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:07,070
In London. My father works in
London, so I've always lived there.

417
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:09,710
But I love the country, too.
Of course you do.

418
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:12,350
Daddy's a solicitor, like Matthew.

419
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:16,791
My, my. You're very well placed if
you're ever in trouble with the law.

420
00:26:17,391 --> 00:26:19,510
Did I tell you I've been given
a colonelcy

421
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,470
in the North Riding Volunteers?

422
00:26:21,471 --> 00:26:23,510
So I'm properly in the army again.

423
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,511
Congratulations.

424
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:29,111
Yeah...
He won't go with them, will he?

425
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,870
When they're called to the front.

426
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:33,311
I hope not, but he seems to think
so.

427
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:38,311
What's it been like?

428
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,751
Do you know, the thing is...

429
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,791
I just can't talk about it.

430
00:26:53,391 --> 00:26:55,430
Have you missed us?

431
00:26:55,431 --> 00:26:57,431
What do you think?

432
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:05,231
You don't mind my bringing Lavinia?

433
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,190
On the contrary, I'm glad.

434
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:09,951
Glad to see you happy.

435
00:27:12,471 --> 00:27:15,390
What about you? Are you happy?

436
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:18,951
I think I'm about to be happy.
Does that count?

437
00:27:20,231 --> 00:27:22,270
It does if you mean it.

438
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:24,271
You'll be the first to know.

439
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:32,711
What are reading?

440
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:35,231
A photoplay about Mabel Normand.

441
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,391
She was nothing when she started,
you know.

442
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:41,430
Her father was a carpenter and
they'd no money.

443
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:43,350
And now she's a shining film star.

444
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:46,471
Ethel, I've a message for you
from Her Ladyship.

445
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:49,230
You're to go up and she her now.

446
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,430
What where?
In the drawing room, of course.

447
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:54,030
They're all in the drawing room.
What have I done wrong?

448
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,070
Nothing. Quite the reverse.

449
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,190
She's very pleased with the way
you've begun

450
00:27:58,191 --> 00:27:59,990
and she wants to thank you.

451
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:01,950
Now?
Yes, now.

452
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:05,711
She's asked for you. How much longer
are you going to keep her waiting?

453
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:16,390
I don't know much about
life in the country,

454
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:18,231
but I do understand
how the law works,

455
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,430
so I believe I can be helpful
to Matthew there.

456
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:22,670
But you'll be immensely helpful.

457
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:25,231
Don't you think so, Mary?
Of course.

458
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:33,110
I beg your pardon, M'Lady,
for keeping you waiting. What?

459
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,470
I'm ever so grateful for your
appreciation

460
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,031
and I want you to know that it's
a privilege to work here.

461
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,831
Ethel, what are you doing in here?

462
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,351
Er... Her Ladyship sent for me.

463
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:50,390
And who gave you this message?

464
00:28:50,391 --> 00:28:53,670
Miss O'Brien. She said I wasn't to
keep Her Ladyship waiting.

465
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:56,430
You may go back downstairs now,
thank you, Ethel.

466
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:58,390
Right.

467
00:28:58,391 --> 00:29:00,271
Thank you, M'Lady.

468
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,910
Well...

469
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:06,791
do we think she's mad, ill
or working for the Russians?

470
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:12,910
She has plenty of time to learn.

471
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:15,790
Cousin Robert will be in charge here
for many years.

472
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:19,430
Lavinia will be a lawyer's wife far
longer than she'll be a countess.

473
00:29:19,431 --> 00:29:21,751
That's if I get through the war in
one piece.

474
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:25,071
Of course you will.
Don't even think like that.

475
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:29,150
How long are you staying in the
village? Just tomorrow.

476
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:31,190
I take the six o'clock train on
Thursday.

477
00:29:31,191 --> 00:29:33,430
And then you'll be in France.

478
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:37,431
Wherever I'm going, I'm so pleased
that we're friends again.

479
00:29:44,111 --> 00:29:47,551
I still don't understand why it was
funny to make me look a fool.

480
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,590
You weren't even there to enjoy it.
Don't worry.

481
00:29:50,591 --> 00:29:52,750
We enjoyed it all right from down
here.

482
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:56,430
Miss O'Brien, Her Ladyship has asked
me to take the incident no further.

483
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:58,430
Don't tempt me to disobey.

484
00:29:58,431 --> 00:30:00,990
Did I see Lady Sybil in the kitchen
yesterday?

485
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,710
She wants to learn some cooking.

486
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,710
She says she's going to train to be
a nurse,

487
00:30:04,711 --> 00:30:07,390
so she needs to know how to cook
and clean and everything.

488
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:10,710
Has she told Her Ladyship about this?
It's supposed to be a surprise.

489
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,750
Mr Carson, it speaks well
of Lady Sybil

490
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:15,871
that she wants to help the wounded.
Let's not give her away.

491
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,190
Why shouldn't she learn how to cook
and scrub?

492
00:30:19,191 --> 00:30:21,031
She may need it when the war's over.

493
00:30:21,032 --> 00:30:23,990
Things are changing,
for her lot and us.

494
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,390
And when they do, I mean to make
the most of it.

495
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:32,070
I take it they ate all the pancakes
last night, then?

496
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:34,071
They did.

497
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,751
Here you are.

498
00:30:45,391 --> 00:30:47,230
What are we aiming at?

499
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,590
They'd like us to take 100 wounded
men.

500
00:30:49,591 --> 00:30:52,231
Three times the number the hospital
was built for.

501
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:56,190
Well, that settles it. We'll have to
convert the second day room.

502
00:30:56,191 --> 00:30:58,470
So there's to be no convalescence at
all?

503
00:30:58,471 --> 00:31:01,510
I'm afraid not. Once they can stand,
they must go.

504
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:04,830
If only there was somewhere nearer
than Farley Hall.

505
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:07,631
I can't get there more than twice
a week at the most.

506
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,791
Should he be doing that?

507
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:15,910
Why not?
I only meant with his condition.

508
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:18,390
What condition is that?
His lungs.

509
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:21,670
Old Lady Grantham told me he's had
a lot of trouble with his lungs.

510
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:24,150
And why did she tell you that,
particularly?

511
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,390
She wanted me to write to the
War Office.

512
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:28,510
She was anxious to spare him the
humiliation

513
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,351
of being refused on medical grounds.

514
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:33,190
And who else did she wish you to
take under your protection?

515
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,631
William Mason, the footman at
the big house.

516
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:40,351
He has a bad skin condition,
apparently, and hates people to know.

517
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:45,871
She wanted to spare him the physical
examination.

518
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:48,431
I'm sure she did.

519
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:52,991
What in Wonderland do you call that?!

520
00:31:53,831 --> 00:31:57,670
I mean, I do not fully understand
what you're trying to do, M'Lady.

521
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,990
I knew it wasn't supposed to
look like this.

522
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:02,190
No, M'Lady. I would go so far as to
say

523
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:05,951
there is no food on the Earth
that is supposed to look like that.

524
00:32:09,871 --> 00:32:11,871
Why does everything go so lumpy?

525
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:15,191
Tell you what, chuck it out and
we'll start again.

526
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:24,271
I don't think we should sell your
mother's house, not yet.

527
00:32:25,431 --> 00:32:28,071
We could rent it out.
Then we can save.

528
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:32,751
When I've some time off, I'll go up
to London and get it ready.

529
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:36,351
Maybe I can come with you.

530
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:38,551
We could do it together.

531
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:43,511
I've got an idea,
that a bit later on...

532
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,270
if we want to...

533
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,591
if we want to start a family.

534
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:54,630
I thought, when the time is right,
we might sell.

535
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,510
And we could buy a small hotel.

536
00:32:57,511 --> 00:33:00,950
Just... just a little one.

537
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:02,990
Maybe near here.

538
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:06,471
Then we could work together and
have the children with us.

539
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,871
What is it?
Nothing, it's just...

540
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:14,550
in my whole life, I never thought

541
00:33:14,551 --> 00:33:16,951
I could be as happy
as I am at this moment.

542
00:33:55,391 --> 00:33:58,990
Don't worry, I haven't come to undo
your good work of the other night.

543
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:00,990
You must have been up before
the servants.

544
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:03,031
They were rather surprised to see me.

545
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,191
I wanted to give you this.

546
00:34:07,751 --> 00:34:09,790
It's my lucky charm.

547
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,630
I've had it always.

548
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,511
So you must promise to bring it back,
without a scratch.

549
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:19,111
Won't you need it?
Not as much as you.

550
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,351
So look after it, please.

551
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:26,390
I'll try not to be a hero,
if that's what you're afraid of.

552
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,231
Just come back, safe and sound.

553
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,351
Did you have a happy time yesterday?

554
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:38,511
I showed Lavinia the places I like
most. To give her a few memories.

555
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:42,631
Mary, if I don't come back -
But - No.

556
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:44,430
If I don't.

557
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,470
Then do remember how very glad I am

558
00:34:46,471 --> 00:34:48,630
that we made up when we had the
chance.

559
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:50,670
I mean it.

560
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,591
You send me off to war a happy man.

561
00:34:56,231 --> 00:34:58,270
Will you do something for me?

562
00:34:58,271 --> 00:35:00,310
Will you...

563
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:03,710
Will you look after Mother,
if anything happens?

564
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:05,910
Of course we will, but it won't.

565
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,630
And Lavinia.

566
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:11,270
She's young, she'll find someone
else, I hop she does anyway.

567
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:14,190
But... until she does.

568
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:19,391
Goodbye, then.

569
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:24,271
And such good luck.

570
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:27,270
Goodbye, Mary.

571
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:29,271
And God bless you.

572
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:18,574
Lady Mary was very much part of the
story, I can assure you.

573
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,454
But how do you know?

574
00:36:20,455 --> 00:36:22,975
Well, you see I worked for Lady Flin-
Ethel...

575
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,695
I hope you've offered our visitor
some tea.

576
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:29,695
I'll go and ask Daisy.

577
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,454
What is the first law of service?

578
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:36,694
We do not discuss the business of
this house with strangers.

579
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,254
But she's not a stranger.
She's Mr Bates' wife.

580
00:36:40,255 --> 00:36:42,255
Has anyone told him she's here?

581
00:36:54,415 --> 00:36:56,454
So you're Anna.

582
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:58,455
I am.

583
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:03,974
You're the one who went to call on
my late, lamented mother-in-law.

584
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,014
Yes, I did.

585
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,255
I know you did.

586
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,815
Sorry to keep you waiting, Vera.

587
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:19,694
I was up in the attics, sorting out
some cupboards.

588
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,094
Don't worry. I've been having
a nice time

589
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,215
here with Ethel and Miss Smith.

590
00:37:25,095 --> 00:37:28,774
Mr Bates, Ethel told me about your
visitor.

591
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,014
So I've had the tea put in my
sitting room.

592
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,255
I thought you might take Mrs Bates
in there.

593
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,214
That's very thoughtful.
It is.

594
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:39,295
But then you're all so kind.

595
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:43,415
I'm beginning to understand why
my Batesy's got so spoiled.

596
00:37:50,655 --> 00:37:52,694
I'm sorry to trouble you, My Lady.

597
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:55,774
What is it, Carson?
Something has been going on

598
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:59,334
and I don't feel quite easy that
you've not been made aware of it.

599
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:02,134
Goodness. What is this dark secret?

600
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:06,494
Lady Sybil has spent
the last two days in the kitchen.

601
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:10,174
What? She asked Mrs Patmore
for some cooking lessons.

602
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:13,694
Now, steady. Even the most
experience cook can burn themself

603
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:16,454
if they're not careful.
Do you think it's ready?

604
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:19,655
I know it's ready.
Go on, you don't want to spoil it.

605
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:24,654
It seems she's made a cake for
Your Ladyship, as a surprise.

606
00:38:24,655 --> 00:38:27,494
But I'm uneasy with surprises
at the best of times

607
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:31,855
and I wonder if the whole exercise
is entirely appropriate. Ta-dah!

608
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,295
I'm not comfortable with this,
My Lady. Not comfortable at all.

609
00:38:40,295 --> 00:38:43,535
I was worried about Lady Sybil,
but I'm not worried any more.

610
00:38:44,535 --> 00:38:46,535
So you don't mind, My Lady?

611
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:50,255
No.

612
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,735
I do not mind.

613
00:38:53,455 --> 00:38:55,695
And I'm very grateful to you.

614
00:38:57,255 --> 00:39:00,934
And, Carson, the cake will be a
surprise whether you approve or not.

615
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:02,935
So please don't give me away.

616
00:39:13,055 --> 00:39:15,535
Sit down.
I don't want to sit down.

617
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,455
Suit yourself.

618
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:24,894
Look, I'm not saying it's all your
fault for how things were between us.

619
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,054
But I couldn't go back to that.

620
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:30,695
I'll take the blame. I'll go to some
hotel in Malton with a tart.

621
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,135
So why hold on?

622
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:38,095
Because I tried it on my own
and I don't like it.

623
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:41,815
You've got money now,
we'd be comfortable.

624
00:39:43,935 --> 00:39:45,814
You're out of your mind.

625
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,414
What makes you think that I would
allow that to happen?

626
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:50,415
You went to prison for me once.

627
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:55,615
I must say, this is very good.

628
00:39:56,335 --> 00:39:58,494
Does Lord Grantham have his own
blend?

629
00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:00,815
Is that all?
Not quite.

630
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:04,213
You see, if you don't come back to
me,

631
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:06,655
I'm going to the newspapers with
a cracking story

632
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,254
and I'd like to bet the Grantham's
won't survive it.

633
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:12,254
And what nonsense is this?

634
00:40:12,255 --> 00:40:14,294
The nonsense I heard when I used
your name

635
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,094
to get a job with Lady Flintshire,
his Lordship's cousin.

636
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,535
I know who Lady Flintshire is.
Well, when I arrived,

637
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:21,254
her maid asked me if it was true.

638
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,655
About Lady Mary Crawley and the
Turkish diplomat.

639
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,934
They thought I'd know, you see,
being your wife.

640
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:28,095
I hope you told them you knew nothing
about it.

641
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,895
As if.

642
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,974
I said, 'Why don't you tell me what
you think you know

643
00:40:36,975 --> 00:40:38,975
and I'll tell you if it's true.'

644
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,774
Goodness me.

645
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,814
Wasn't my patience rewarded.

646
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:46,334
The public's bored with the war,
you see.

647
00:40:46,335 --> 00:40:48,254
They like gossip.

648
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:51,574
And a diplomat dying in the bed of
an earl's unmarried daughter,

649
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:55,054
well, that takes the ticket for the
tale of the year.

650
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,854
It's a pack of lies! I assume
that's loyalty and not ignorance.

651
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:01,094
Because, you see, I heard
that Lady Mary needed

652
00:41:01,095 --> 00:41:03,814
her maid to help her carry him and,
yes, you've guessed it,

653
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,414
your precious Anna's going to figure
in the story, too.

654
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:10,014
Not to worry too much.
It's not a criminal offence, is it?

655
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:11,855
Just a social one.

656
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:18,694
You bitch.
Please, be my guest.

657
00:41:18,695 --> 00:41:20,414
But then you must excuse me

658
00:41:20,415 --> 00:41:22,615
while I run into town and have it
photographed.

659
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:34,734
What do you want from me?

660
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:37,094
Firstly, hand in your notice...

661
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,814
tonight.

662
00:41:38,815 --> 00:41:40,695
I'll put up at the pub in the
village.

663
00:41:40,696 --> 00:41:43,294
And what reason do I give?
You don't need a reason.

664
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,334
Just tell them that you're going.

665
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,614
And then tomorrow we head back to
London.

666
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:50,095
We'll stay in your mother's house
for the time being,

667
00:41:50,096 --> 00:41:51,894
till we get ourselves sorted.

668
00:41:51,895 --> 00:41:55,335
And in case you're wondering,
whatever my future plans may be,

669
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,455
they will involve you.

670
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:15,814
Bates, when you first came here,
I fought to keep you!

671
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:19,174
Everyone was against me, everyone,
from Her Ladyship to Carson.

672
00:42:19,175 --> 00:42:21,454
They thought I was mad.
But I said to them,

673
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,774
'After all that we've been through,
Bates and I,

674
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:26,694
I owe him my loyalty!'
I appreciate that, M'Lord, but...

675
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:30,534
But what? But loyalty doesn't matter
to you? It does matter, M'Lord.

676
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,134
Not enough to make you change your
mind. Not even enough

677
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,414
to make you stay until I've found
a replacement!

678
00:42:35,415 --> 00:42:38,694
I can't. You won't take any more
money off me. You leave empty-handed!

679
00:42:38,695 --> 00:42:40,695
I don't want money, M'Lord.

680
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,773
I'm sorry, Bates, that was a low
shot.

681
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:45,095
Of course you can have whatever is
owning to you.

682
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:50,535
I thought we were friends,
that's all.

683
00:42:51,855 --> 00:42:54,814
I thought we'd crossed the great
divide, successfully.

684
00:42:54,815 --> 00:42:57,854
Well, I've had my say,
it's your life.

685
00:42:57,855 --> 00:43:00,014
But you've disappointed me, Bates.

686
00:43:00,015 --> 00:43:03,215
I cannot remember being more
disappointed in any man.

687
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,934
I don't believe it.
You say my life is over

688
00:43:08,935 --> 00:43:11,654
and your wife will collect you first
thing and that's it?

689
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:13,894
Have you mentioned this to anyone
else?

690
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:15,895
Only Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

691
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,494
The others can find out when
I've gone.

692
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,214
I know you've not told me the real
reason. You're wrong.

693
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,294
Vera has reminded me
that I'm a married man.

694
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,055
I must give my vows another chance.

695
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:27,734
I had not right to involve you in
my life. Yes, but you see,

696
00:43:27,735 --> 00:43:30,414
that's just what I don't agree with.
You had every right.

697
00:43:30,415 --> 00:43:33,294
I know you.
You're doing something gallant here,

698
00:43:33,295 --> 00:43:36,134
making a sacrifice for my honour,
but I don't want you to.

699
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:38,174
I don't care. Don't you understand?

700
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:40,214
I don't care what people say.

701
00:43:40,215 --> 00:43:42,254
I'd live in sin with you.

702
00:43:42,255 --> 00:43:45,934
If she's threatening to ruin me,
then let her. It's nothing to me.

703
00:43:45,935 --> 00:43:48,574
The only ruin that I recognise is to
be without you.

704
00:43:48,575 --> 00:43:50,334
Forget me and be happy, please.

705
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:52,695
I couldn't. Not ever.

706
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:58,295
You should and you must.

707
00:44:00,415 --> 00:44:02,415
I am nothing.

708
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,095
William? I thought everyone had gone
up.

709
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:21,215
I'm just looking for that magazine
Ethel were reading.

710
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,294
I hope you've noticed I'm not scared
of electricity any more.

711
00:44:27,295 --> 00:44:30,614
Well, not much. I couldn't touch
a switch when it were only upstairs,

712
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,615
but I've got used to it now.

713
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,295
I hate to see you like this.

714
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,774
Even though I'm a dirty coward?

715
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,814
You're not. Not to me.

716
00:44:39,815 --> 00:44:41,774
But why don't I enlist?

717
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:43,814
I could.

718
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:46,534
I know I promised my dad,
but he's not my owner.

719
00:44:46,535 --> 00:44:48,535
He's not the law.

720
00:44:49,455 --> 00:44:52,694
Am I frightened?
Is that it, honestly?

721
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:54,734
Don't be so hard on yourself.

722
00:44:54,735 --> 00:44:56,735
No-one wants to go to war.

723
00:44:58,375 --> 00:45:01,455
I wish you'd cheer up, please.

724
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:04,454
I'd do anything to cheer you up.

725
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,455
Like what?

726
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:10,055
Like this.

727
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,934
You just feel sorry for me.

728
00:45:19,935 --> 00:45:21,974
William, I've kissed you!

729
00:45:21,975 --> 00:45:25,055
You've wanted me to long enough.
Well, now I have. Enjoy it.

730
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,694
Does this mean you'll be my girl?

731
00:45:28,695 --> 00:45:32,015
Daisy? Cos if you were my girl,
I know I could tackle anything.

732
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:50,534
We were supposed to be at rest for
ten days at least.

733
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:52,814
Orders arrived this morning, sir.

734
00:45:52,815 --> 00:45:55,855
The King's N were hit bad,
so they're out and we're in.

735
00:45:56,455 --> 00:46:00,374
They've been shelling the trench
since we got here. Anybody hurt?

736
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:03,855
Rankin's dead and
Kent and Corporal Wright was hit.

737
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:06,974
Thank God the stretcher bearers were
there.

738
00:46:06,975 --> 00:46:09,015
Let's see what the damage is now.
Sir.

739
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:19,775
All right?
Morning, sir.

740
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:28,095
Look out!

741
00:46:34,055 --> 00:46:36,055
Medic!

742
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:39,094
Thomas?

743
00:46:39,095 --> 00:46:42,215
It is Thomas, isn't it?
Corporal Barrow now, Mr Crawley.

744
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:46,375
You'll never guess
where I've just been.

745
00:47:05,775 --> 00:47:10,254
Where's Anna? She's not feeling very
well today, Your Ladyship.

746
00:47:10,255 --> 00:47:12,334
I've taken over for the time being.

747
00:47:12,335 --> 00:47:14,374
That's so kind of you.

748
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,774
Just make sure Lady Sybil packs
things

749
00:47:16,775 --> 00:47:19,214
she can get in and out of
without a maid.

750
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:22,614
I don't need that.
I'd never wear it.

751
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:25,934
But you must have something decent.
Suppose you're invited to dinner?

752
00:47:25,935 --> 00:47:27,655
I know this is hard for you to
grasp,

753
00:47:27,656 --> 00:47:30,254
but I'm not there to go out to
dinner. I'm there to learn.

754
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:32,255
Take one, just in case.

755
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:37,014
We'll miss you. Don't be silly,
it's only two months.

756
00:47:37,015 --> 00:47:39,054
And I'll come home if I can.

757
00:47:39,055 --> 00:47:42,894
Why don't I drive you? She's taking
enough chance with her life as it is.

758
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:44,934
Granny.

759
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:48,334
What is this driving mania?
It'll be useful.

760
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:51,654
They won't let a healthy man drive
us around for much longer.

761
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:54,454
And if Sybil can be a nurse,
why can't I be a chauffeur?

762
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,934
Well, I shall leave you.

763
00:47:56,935 --> 00:48:00,815
I have been summoned by Cousin Isobel
for tea.

764
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:04,814
Goodbye, Sybil.
And good luck with it all.

765
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,735
Thank you for being such a sport.

766
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,855
It's a big step you're taking, dear.

767
00:48:10,615 --> 00:48:14,055
But war deals out strange tasks.

768
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:16,695
Remember your great aunt, Roberta.

769
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:18,894
What about her?

770
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:22,055
She loaded the guns at Lucknow.

771
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:26,575
I'll come with you.
I'll tell William to fetch the bags.

772
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:31,135
The first of you to leave the nest.

773
00:48:33,015 --> 00:48:36,494
Poor Mama. She always feels
these things so dreadfully.

774
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:38,534
That's her American blood.

775
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:41,734
I'm so glad we've settled everything
with Cousin Matthew.

776
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:44,934
Aren't you, Mary? Please
stop treading on eggshells.

777
00:48:44,935 --> 00:48:46,935
I've other fish to fry.

778
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:22,078
I make no apology.

779
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,718
It would be a terrible thing if poor,
old Mr Molesley's son were killed.

780
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:29,038
Wouldn't it, Molesley?
I'm sure it would, but...

781
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,278
And then I heard William's father

782
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:35,799
would be left on his own if anything
happened to the boy.

783
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:39,918
And what would become of Carson if
the last of his staff were to go?

784
00:49:39,919 --> 00:49:42,598
That's not the point.
Do you want Molesley to die?

785
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,318
Of course I don't!
Well.

786
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:46,279
I don't want my own son to die,
either.

787
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,718
But this is a war and we must be in
it together!

788
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,598
High and low, rich and poor.

789
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,718
There can be no special cases,

790
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,158
because every man at the front
is a special case to someone.

791
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,878
Mrs Crawley is right.

792
00:49:57,879 --> 00:49:59,958
I understand your motives,
Lady Grantham,

793
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:01,678
and I do not criticise them.

794
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,078
Thank you. But I shall write
to the Ministry at once,

795
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:07,198
correcting the misinformation.

796
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:09,039
Good day. I'll see myself out.

797
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:12,758
Molesley, you understand why I said
what I did?

798
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,559
Indeed. I do, ma'am.

799
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,518
You won't be called up at once.

800
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,958
Not while there are younger men to
be taken.

801
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,879
But they'll get you in the end,
Molesley.

802
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:27,879
And you can blame Mrs Crawley
when they do.

803
00:50:31,399 --> 00:50:34,559
I wish you'd stop working
for one minute.

804
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,359
At least put the light on,
or you'll strain your eyes.

805
00:50:39,959 --> 00:50:42,479
It's getting dark so early now.

806
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,919
Has she gone?
She has.

807
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,798
So... we've lost Mr Bates
and Lady Sybil in one day.

808
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:52,878
I can't believe it.

809
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,359
I suppose I'll have to look after
His Lordship now,

810
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,878
on top of everything else.
And I don't want any jokes

811
00:50:57,879 --> 00:51:00,279
about broomsticks and sweeping
the floor.

812
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:04,398
His Lordship's got his regimental
dinner in Richmond tonight.

813
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:06,999
That means he'll be in the full fig.
You'll manage.

814
00:51:08,279 --> 00:51:11,078
You know, when Mr Bates first came
to this house,

815
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:13,039
I thought he could never do the work.

816
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,518
But now I can't imagine the place
without him.

817
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:17,639
Did you see this coming?
Because I didn't.

818
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,358
I have a confession.

819
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:22,798
I let them have their tea
in my sitting room.

820
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:25,798
That was nice of you.
It was quite nice.

821
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:27,799
But I had my reasons.

822
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:32,238
There's a grating on the wall

823
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,079
which means you can hear what's
being said in the room.

824
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,078
Now if I was a gentleman,
I wouldn't want to know.

825
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,118
But you're not.

826
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:43,119
Fortunately.

827
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,078
It'll be hard to let you go.

828
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,799
My last link with home.

829
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,839
Not as hard as it is for me.

830
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:18,078
Branson - I know I shouldn't say it,
but I can't keep it in any longer.

831
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,518
I wish you would. I told myself and
told myself, you're too far above me.

832
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:23,718
But things are changing.
When the war is over,

833
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:26,438
the world won't be the same place
as it was when it started.

834
00:52:26,439 --> 00:52:29,398
And I'll make something of myself,
I promise. I know you will.

835
00:52:29,399 --> 00:52:31,838
Then bet on me.

836
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:34,558
And if your family casts you off,
it won't be forever.

837
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,998
They'll come around.
And until they do,

838
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:41,999
I promise to devote every waking
minute to your happiness.

839
00:52:43,879 --> 00:52:46,158
I'm terribly flattered.

840
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,599
Don't say that.
Why not?

841
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:51,798
Because 'flattered' is a word posh
people use

842
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,599
when they're getting ready to say no.

843
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,278
That sounds more like you.

844
00:52:57,279 --> 00:52:59,318
Please don't make fun of me.

845
00:52:59,319 --> 00:53:03,159
No. It's cost me all I've got
to say these things.

846
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,719
Right.

847
00:53:12,759 --> 00:53:14,638
I'll go. I'll hand in my notice

848
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,558
and I won't be there when you get
back - No, don't do that.

849
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:20,919
I must. They won't let me stay
when they've heard what I've said.

850
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,319
They won't hear.

851
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,079
Not from me.

852
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,679
Bloody hell.
There must be more to life than this.

853
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:48,759
You all right, Corporal?

854
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:54,719
I think so. Yeah, more or less.

855
00:54:03,439 --> 00:54:05,478
My God.

856
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:08,238
They won't believe it back home
where I come from.

857
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,198
I thought, 'Medical Corps,
not much danger there.'

858
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:14,199
How wrong can one man be?

859
00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:17,439
Here.

860
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:19,958
I think it comes down to luck.

861
00:54:19,959 --> 00:54:23,638
If a bullet's got your name on it,
there's nothing you can do.

862
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:26,999
If not, then thank God you were
lucky...

863
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:35,239
Get these bodies away!

864
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:38,199
Come on, Corporal Barrow!

865
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,358
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to
be here tonight, sir.

866
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,799
We are very pleased to have you
here, Grantham.

867
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,599
You see, just to know that I'm with
you all, to sense that I belong here.

868
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,719
It's as simple as this,
I no longer feel like a fraud.

869
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:06,758
Mr Molesley, what are you doing
here?

870
00:55:06,759 --> 00:55:09,638
I was waiting to see you, Doctor.
How can I help?

871
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,638
It's just I was wondering whether
you'd written that letter.

872
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,558
The one you spoke of this afternoon.
To the War Office?

873
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:18,238
Not yet. I'm sorry
you were involved in all that.

874
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:21,038
I should've checked with you first,
before I interfered.

875
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:23,798
That's just it. You see, I think if
you had checked with me,

876
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:26,478
you'd have found exactly what
Lady Grantham described.

877
00:55:26,479 --> 00:55:28,718
I don't quite...
I have trouble with my lungs.

878
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,758
I get so...

879
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:32,798
breathless sometimes.

880
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,838
And...

881
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,359
I've noticed it's getting worse.

882
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:45,438
They haven't written to William yet.

883
00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:48,679
The Ministry, I mean.
But they have discharged me.

884
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,159
Won't it just make extra work for
them

885
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,959
to have to fail me all over again?

886
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:56,478
Very well.

887
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:59,238
I shall correct my statement as
regards William,

888
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,719
but make no mention of you.
Thank you, Doctor.

889
00:56:02,959 --> 00:56:04,998
It's all right.

890
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,038
But, Molesley...

891
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,519
I hope you will help the war effort,
in other ways.

892
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,238
When might the regiment be wanted,
sir?

893
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:19,598
The talk at dinner suggested
it would be soon.

894
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,638
Pretty soon, I'd say.

895
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:25,279
Well, I'm as ready now
as I'll ever be.

896
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,678
For what?
To go to France, with the regiment.

897
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:31,718
Why would you do that?

898
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,878
Because I'm their colonel, of course.

899
00:56:33,879 --> 00:56:36,158
Well, there must be some use for me
over there.

900
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,158
My dear fellow, we're not as
heartless as that!

901
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:43,239
The position's only an honorary one.
Nobody expects you to go to war.

902
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:46,878
An honorary one? We thought
it'd cheer things up a bit

903
00:56:46,879 --> 00:56:49,158
to have the Lord Lieutenant
at our table.

904
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,919
And so it does. We're very glad
to welcome to you here.

905
00:56:53,479 --> 00:56:57,238
I see. We old codgers
have our work cut out for us

906
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,078
keeping spirits high at home.
Someone must.

907
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,278
Indeed, sir.
Is that Taxi Cavendish?

908
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:05,279
I must catch him before I go.

909
00:57:19,474 --> 00:57:21,714
So Lady Sybil got off all right in
the end.

910
00:57:22,594 --> 00:57:25,433
I'm afraid we have to admit
she knows what she wants.

911
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,353
Yes. She certainly does.

912
00:57:27,354 --> 00:57:29,714
I don't suppose the war will leave
any of us alone

913
00:57:29,715 --> 00:57:31,554
by the time it's done.

914
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:34,473
I got a letter from Thomas the other
day.

915
00:57:34,474 --> 00:57:37,273
He writes that when he thinks about
how things used to be,

916
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:39,274
it seems like a dream.

917
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:41,954
It's not much more than two years
ago,

918
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:44,073
but he says it might as well be a
century.

919
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:46,514
So you hear from Thomas. Is he well?

920
00:57:46,994 --> 00:57:49,033
Please give him my regards.

921
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:51,034
He's well enough, M'Lady.

922
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:54,073
But I don't think he'd mind coming
home.

923
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:56,074
How I wish he could, O'Brien.

924
00:57:57,794 --> 00:58:00,234
Of course, if Bates hadn't been so
bloody selfish,

925
00:58:00,235 --> 00:58:03,193
he would have let us plan for his
departure properly.

926
00:58:03,194 --> 00:58:07,913
Your Lordship, I have information
that I have no proper claim to.

927
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:09,953
Well, what is it?

928
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:13,913
Well, if Your Lordship can assure me
that you will keep it to yourself?

929
00:58:13,914 --> 00:58:17,554
I promise, Carson.
You can drop the last veil.

930
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:21,153
Well, I feel it only right to tell
you

931
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,873
that Mr Bates' leaving was not
selfish.

932
00:58:23,874 --> 00:58:26,594
Quite the reverse.
It felt selfish to me.

933
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:30,994
As for the wretched Anna,
bedizened with dishonest promises.

934
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:34,833
Mr Bates left because had he not
done so,

935
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:38,513
his wife was planning to engulf
this house in scandal.

936
00:58:38,514 --> 00:58:40,514
Scandal?

937
00:58:41,754 --> 00:58:43,753
What scandal?
The point is, My Lord,

938
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46,313
Mrs Bates would have made Downton
notorious.

939
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,873
The price of her silence was her
husband's return.

940
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:52,713
But I must know what story she was
planning to tell.

941
00:58:52,714 --> 00:58:54,833
I'm sorry, My Lord,
I could not speak of it

942
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:57,114
without injuring you and
betraying myself.

943
00:58:58,074 --> 00:59:00,633
But you are saying that Bates
fell on his sword

944
00:59:00,634 --> 00:59:02,834
to protect the reputation
of my family?

945
00:59:16,914 --> 00:59:18,914
Ethel, what are you doing?

946
00:59:19,594 --> 00:59:21,633
Seeing to the plugs for the night.

947
00:59:21,634 --> 00:59:25,233
What? Polishing the electric plugs
and checking them for vapours.

948
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,273
And why are you doing this?

949
00:59:27,274 --> 00:59:29,313
Because you were too busy.

950
00:59:29,314 --> 00:59:32,473
She said you usually did it,
but could I manage it tonight.

951
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:35,434
And 'she', I take it,
would be Miss O'Brien?

952
00:59:37,674 --> 00:59:39,553
Go to bed, Ethel.

953
00:59:39,554 --> 00:59:43,114
Next time she gives you an order,
ask me first.

954
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,753
Is anything the matter?
Nothing.

955
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:57,673
Except that today has shown me
I'm not only a worthless man,

956
00:59:57,674 --> 01:00:00,153
but also a bad-tempered and
ungrateful one.

957
01:00:00,154 --> 01:00:02,154
Well, we all know that.

958
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:07,594
Can I help?

959
01:00:11,354 --> 01:00:13,354
I wonder how Sybil's feeling.

960
01:00:13,434 --> 01:00:15,953
The war's reaching its long fingers
into Downton

961
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:17,793
and scattering our chicks.

962
01:00:17,794 --> 01:00:19,793
But I'm glad we made peace
with Matthew.

963
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:22,713
I agree.
Let us thank Sir Richard Carlisle

964
01:00:22,714 --> 01:00:25,434
for distracting Mary
at just the right moment.

965
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:30,073
By the way, she wants him to come
and stay. So we can all meet him.

966
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:34,153
She wants us to invite a hawker of
newspaper scandal

967
01:00:34,154 --> 01:00:36,193
to stay as a guest in this house?

968
01:00:36,194 --> 01:00:38,194
It's lucky I have a sense of irony.

969
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,394
Not you, too.

970
01:01:03,234 --> 01:01:05,273
What's the matter?

971
01:01:05,274 --> 01:01:07,034
Why ask? You don't care.

972
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:09,993
Ethel...

973
01:01:09,994 --> 01:01:13,233
Perhaps if you stopped going on
about all the marvellous things

974
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:15,354
you're going to do when you leave
service.

975
01:01:15,954 --> 01:01:17,954
But you've got to have dreams.

976
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:20,873
Don't you have any dreams?

977
01:01:20,874 --> 01:01:22,913
Of course I do.

978
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:24,914
Big dreams.

979
01:01:26,594 --> 01:01:29,314
It's just that I know now
they won't be coming true.

980
01:01:41,954 --> 01:01:44,674
What do you want?
I think I left my book in here.

981
01:01:51,554 --> 01:01:54,153
Is that all?
You were praying.

982
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:56,193
Don't be ridiculous.

983
01:01:56,194 --> 01:01:58,233
You were praying.

984
01:01:58,234 --> 01:02:00,994
What were you praying for?
Please go. I'm tired.

985
01:02:22,634 --> 01:02:24,673
Dear Lord,

986
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,554
I don't pretend to have much credit
with you.

987
01:02:28,874 --> 01:02:30,874
I'm not even sure that you're there.

988
01:02:32,634 --> 01:02:34,673
But if you are,

989
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:38,113
and if I've ever done anything good,

990
01:02:38,114 --> 01:02:40,674
I beg you to keep him safe.

991
01:03:06,674 --> 01:03:09,114
You look very comfortable there,
Corporal.

992
01:03:12,474 --> 01:03:14,513
Would you like some, sir?

993
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:16,514
We've got condensed milk and sugar.

994
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:19,314
I won't ask how you managed that.

995
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:25,114
Go on, sir.

996
01:03:28,514 --> 01:03:30,553
That's nectar.

997
01:03:30,554 --> 01:03:32,593
Are you sure you can spare it?

998
01:03:32,594 --> 01:03:35,233
Gladly, if we can talk about
the old days

999
01:03:35,234 --> 01:03:37,834
and forget about all of this
for a minute or two.

1000
01:03:40,674 --> 01:03:42,594
Do you ever hear from anyone?
Yes.

1001
01:03:42,595 --> 01:03:44,633
Miss O'Brien keeps me informed.

1002
01:03:44,634 --> 01:03:46,673
Lady Edith's driving.

1003
01:03:46,674 --> 01:03:48,914
Lady Sybil's training as a nurse.

1004
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,793
Miss O'Brien tells me the hospital's
busier than ever,

1005
01:03:54,794 --> 01:03:56,833
with the wounded coming in.

1006
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:58,873
Is that true?
Certainly is.

1007
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:01,994
They had a concert when I was there
to raise extra funds.

1008
01:04:05,034 --> 01:04:07,073
I'm curious, sir.

1009
01:04:07,074 --> 01:04:10,633
Do you think I could ever get a
transfer back to the hospital?

1010
01:04:10,634 --> 01:04:12,634
Seeing as it's war work.

1011
01:04:13,434 --> 01:04:16,074
Well, you'd have to be sent home
from the front, first.

1012
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,554
And then you might have to
pull a few strings.

1013
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,913
Thank you for that.

1014
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,914
Thank you very much.

1015
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:30,393
What would my mother say?

1016
01:04:30,394 --> 01:04:33,594
Me entertaining the future
Earl of Grantham to tea.

1017
01:04:35,514 --> 01:04:38,953
War has a way of distinguishing
between the things that matter

1018
01:04:38,954 --> 01:04:40,954
and the things that don't.

1019
01:05:56,274 --> 01:05:58,313
Thank you.

1020
01:05:58,314 --> 01:06:00,314
Thank you for my deliverance.

1021
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:07,713
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle?

1022
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:10,793
Her uncle and I are old friends.
Well, old acquaintances, anyway.

1023
01:06:10,794 --> 01:06:14,353
How dare you threaten me. I assure
you, I dare a great deal more than that!

1024
01:06:14,354 --> 01:06:16,234
If you still love him, let him
know.

1025
01:06:16,235 --> 01:06:19,393
If you don't tell him, you could
regret it all your life long.

1026
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:21,633
You're like a real soldier!
I am a real soldier.

1027
01:06:21,634 --> 01:06:23,794
Thank you very much.
Now come and give me a kiss.

1028
01:06:25,874 --> 01:06:27,874
You see, I want you to marry me.

1029
01:06:28,274 --> 01:06:30,433
Carson!

1030
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:33,114
You'll find there's never a dull
moment in this house.

1031
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:38,439

3
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,800
Letter for you, William.

4
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,405
Why on earth are you doing that?

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,180
Well, someone's got to. Yes, indeed
they do.

6
00:00:57,215 --> 00:00:59,920
And that someone is William or one
of the maids.

7
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:02,405
You're making work for yourself,
Mr Carson,

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,680
and I've no sympathy with that.
I'm not asking for sympathy.

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,285
I don't think you should be... What?

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,200
For heaven's sake. If something's
wrong put it right.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm sorry, Lang. I don't mean to
snap.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,000
Not to worry, my lord. You've been
in the trenches I have not.

13
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:24,040
I have no right to criticise.

14
00:01:24,075 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not a soldier now.

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,880
You've been invalided out. That is
perfectly honourable.

16
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:32,840
Is it?

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,040
People look at me and wonder why I'm
not in uniform.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,440
Then you refer them to me and I'll
give them a piece of my mind.

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Hm?

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,440
Penny for your thoughts. They're
worth a great deal more than that.

21
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,920
What is it? My papers. They've come.
I've been called up.

22
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:59,405
Oh, you never have. What does it
mean?

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,940
I report for my medical
on Wednesday and once

24
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm through that I go
to Richmond for training.

25
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:08,440
Then you go to war? With any luck. I'll be
beggared if it's over before I get there.

26
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,880
If they'd listen to me it'd be over
by tea time.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Daisy, I wonder...would you give me
a picture to take with me?

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
I haven't got one. Then have one
taken, on your afternoon off, please.

29
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:22,240
That's enough. Let her get on with
her work.

30
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,685
How's Thomas coming along?

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,360
I wish he could be treated at our
hospital here.

32
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,960
Well, it's only for officers. Of
course.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,085
Although, ideally he'd love to be
transferred there to work.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
He won't be sent back to the front?
Not with his hand the way it is.

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,240
It's such a pity he isn't under Dr
Clarkson.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,485
We might have been able to influence
him a bit. I should hope so.

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,060
Without this family
and all the money you've

38
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:51,600
spent his precious hospital
wouldn't exist at all.

39
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:53,920
Perhaps I'll ask his advice. You
never know.

40
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,760
I was sure you'd have a good idea of
what to do for the best.

41
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,780
Fancy a tour in England, Davis?

42
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:08,805
I assume you're having me on, sir.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,080
Not at all. General Sir Herbert
Strutt

44
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:13,320
has asked for my transfer to be his
ADC.

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
He's touring England to boost recruitment.
I know Manchester and Yorkshire well.

46
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,200
It would mean a few months at home
and a promotion to captain.

47
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,160
I can't object to that.

48
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,080
I've only got a few days before the
medical, my lady.

49
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:29,165
Then go and tell your father.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,560
You don't mind, do you,
Carson? We must manage

51
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:33,920
with no footman at all
from next Wednesday.

52
00:03:33,955 --> 00:03:37,240
It'll be no different if we start
now. And you've always got Lang.

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
We wish you every good fortune.
Don't we, darling?

54
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,645
We certainly do.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
Good luck, William. Thank you, my
lord.

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,740
So, both my footmen have gone to the
war

57
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,960
while I cut ribbons and make
speeches.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
And keep people's spirits up...

59
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,840
which is very important.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,440
By God, I envy them though.

61
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,360
I envy their self respect and I envy
their ability to sleep at night.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,100
Mr Carson doesn't like
the smell of cleaning

63
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,400
materials in here, not
just before luncheon.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,440
Come on, Mrs O'Brien. We don't want
to be unfriendly, do we?

65
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:27,320
You obviously don't.

66
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Finish it now but don't blame me if
Mr Carson takes a bit out of you.

67
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,680
Hello, Mr Lang. Everything all
right?

68
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,325
Why do you say that?

69
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,480
No reason. I only meant I hope
you're enjoying yourself.

70
00:04:46,515 --> 00:04:48,525
I know I would be in your shoes.

71
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,680
You never tried for the job, did
you? I never got the chance.

72
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,800
I'd no sooner heard that Mr Bates
was gone than he arrived.

73
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,440
What brings you here, Mr Molesley?

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,480
I was wondering if Anna was anywhere
around.

75
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,720
I could find her if you like. Oh,
no, no, no.

76
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,920
Just give her this. We were talking
about it the other day

77
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:13,040
and I came across a copy in...Ripon.

78
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,520
Elizabeth And Her German Garden?

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,445
Whatever's that about?

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
It's about an invitation to talk
some more, that's what.

81
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,520
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

82
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,040
Lady Grantham.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,160
I'd love to help but it's not within
my power

84
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:42,400
to hook men from hither and thither
as I please.

85
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,720
That's not at all what I was asking.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,480
I thought you were saying you wanted
Corporal Barrow

87
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,205
to come and work here when he's fully
recovered.

88
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,920
I think it a credit to him that he
wants to continue to serve in this way...

89
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,660
after he's been wounded. Well,
that's as maybe

90
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:01,480
but it's not for me to decide what
happens next.

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,445
Mr Carson, are you quite well?

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Oh, leave me alone.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,720
After 24 hours it disappeared. Are
you all right, Carson? Of course.

94
00:06:25,755 --> 00:06:28,760
That is, perfectly all right, Your
Ladyship, thank you.

95
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,485
Er, no.

96
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,680
Cousin Isobel says Matthew's coming
home in a fortnight.

97
00:06:34,715 --> 00:06:36,960
He's touring England with some
general.

98
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,920
We'll have a dinner when he's here.

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,920
I was going to ask Richard Carlisle
about then for Saturday to Monday.

100
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,260
Be careful, Mary. Sir Richard
mustn't think you're after him.

101
00:06:48,295 --> 00:06:51,487
Isn't that the truth? The truth is
neither here nor there.

102
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,680
It's the look of the thing that
matters. Ask Rosamund.

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,480
It'll take the edge off it. That'll
be nice.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,045
Like before the war.

105
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,600
How can we manage a pre-war house
party without a single footman?

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,400
My dear, Rosamund is not a house
party.

107
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,080
She's blood.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,780
I saw Mrs Drake when I went into the
village.

109
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,560
The wife of John Drake who has
Longfield Farm.

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,125
Oh. What did she have to say?

111
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,760
Apparently their final able-bodied
farmhand has been called up.

112
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,285
They need a man to drive the
tractor.

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,680
Hasn't Drake recovered from his illness?
I thought he was better. He's much better.

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,200
But he doesn't drive.

115
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,005
So I told her I could do it.

116
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,400
What? I said I could drive the
tractor.

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,520
Edith! You are a lady not Toad of
Toad Hall.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,960
Well, I'm doing it.

119
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,320
Don't look so bewildered. It's
simple.

120
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,725
I will drive the tractor.

121
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,565
Well, can you do that? Absolutely.

122
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,720
Can you hitch up the plough or
whatever it is I'm dragging?

123
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,200
Of course. When would you like me to
start?

124
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,760
I'd better get you something to
wear.

125
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
Oh, I like a bit of life
in a house but I just

126
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:21,840
hope Mr Carson doesn't
spontaneously combust.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,560
I had a letter yesterday.

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,205
Yes? It's my sister's boy.

129
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
He's with the Lancashire Fusiliers.

130
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:31,485
Only he's gone missing.

131
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,280
Missing presumed dead they call it.

132
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,720
Oh, no.

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,680
How did it happen? They can't find out
- how it happened, why it happened,

134
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:45,560
whether we can be sure it did happen
or he isn't lying prisoner somewhere.

135
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:51,320
Ask his lordship. He'll have friends in
the War Office. They can dig something up.

136
00:08:51,355 --> 00:08:53,680
Oh, I don't like to bother him.

137
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Why not? He's got broad shoulders.

138
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,160
That's ever so fine, Mr Lang.

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
How can you make those big hands do
such delicate work?

140
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,800
I expect there's no end to the
things they could manage.

141
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:11,760
Giving you a slap for a start.

142
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
That is good. Very good.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,760
I like to see a proper skill.

144
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Blokes think they can be a valet if
they can smile and tie a shoelace

145
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,800
but there's an art to it and I can
tell you've got it.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,320
My mother taught me.

147
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,080
She was a lady's maid, like you.

148
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,205
Well, she knew what she was about.

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh, Mr Lang. As you know, Sir
Richard Carlisle arrives later

150
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,405
and the Crawleys are coming for
dinner tonight.

151
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,640
I really can't have maids in the
dining room for such a party

152
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,840
so I'd be grateful if you'd help me
and play the footman.

153
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,325
Me? Wait at table?

154
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,205
Well, it's not ideal but I'm afraid
I've no choice.

155
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,120
The footman's liveries are in a
cupboard past Mrs Hughes' sitting room.

156
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,240
You should find one to fit you.

157
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
I'm not sure what I can do but I'm
happy to try.

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
What's his name? Archie.

159
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,680
That is Archibald Philpotts.

160
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,980
He was in the Lancashire Fusiliers.

161
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,080
They think he was in northern
France.

162
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,360
You realise the most likely outcome
is that he has indeed been killed.

163
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
I understand, my lord. But we'd
rather know the worst than wonder.

164
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,200
Hm.

165
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,165
Ah. Oh, hello, Mr Molesley.

166
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,400
What are you doing here? I asked inside
and they said you were at the laundry.

167
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:42,520
Lady Mary is wearing this tonight. I
wasn't sure it was done.

168
00:10:42,555 --> 00:10:45,377
I wondered if you'd had a chance to
read that book.

169
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,200
You only gave it to me yesterday. Of
course, of course.

170
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,040
But when you have read it I hope we
can exchange our views.

171
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,400
That'd be nice. Perhaps we might
bring some of the others in.

172
00:10:57,435 --> 00:10:59,680
We could have a sort of reading
club.

173
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,805
We could do that.

174
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,040
Or we could talk about it together
just we two.

175
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,800
Heavens. It's later than I thought.
I must get on.

176
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,320
I'm off to change but I wanted you to
know I sent a note to Clarkson

177
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,805
which should do the trick. What did
you say?

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,960
That you'd asked a favour and, given that
the estate shoulders the hospital costs,

179
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,800
it did seem unfair if we weren't
allowed a few perks.

180
00:11:35,835 --> 00:11:38,240
Quite right. Thank you, darling.

181
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,880
Well done, my lady.

182
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,040
Ready?

183
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,240
Ready!

184
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,800
Come on, damn you.

185
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,400
Whoa-ho-ho! Yes!

186
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,400
To the victor...the spoils.

187
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,565
Did you plant that tree?

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
Steady on. It must be 40 years old.

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,480
It's not a flattering light.

190
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,920
My father planted it. But you have
to be tough with fruit trees,

191
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,880
not let them outstay their welcome.

192
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,040
Farming needs a kind of toughness,
doesn't it?

193
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:41,840
There's room for sentiment but not
sentimentality.

194
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,080
Beautifully put, if I may say so, my
lady.

195
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,040
You should be a writer. Thank you.

196
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,720
How are you getting on? Very well, I
think.

197
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,920
It's not too hard for you? Not at
all. She's stronger than she looks.

198
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,600
I've brought you something to eat,
my lady.

199
00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm afraid it's not what you're used
to.

200
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:01,880
Hey, it's not for you.

201
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,880
So it is you.

202
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,360
Ethel thought I must have a soldier
fancy man.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Is she the new maid? Yes.

204
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,760
She's a soppy sort.

205
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,800
So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson
thrilled to have your services?

206
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,160
It's Major Clarkson now but yes.

207
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,360
I don't know how you did it.

208
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,720
What about your blighty?

209
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,880
My God. It's not so bad.

210
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,080
And it lived up to its name and got
me home.

211
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,925
You'd better come inside.

212
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,245
Where's William? Training for the
army.

213
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,520
I thought he might have died for
love of you.

214
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,605
Don't be nasty as soon as you're
back.

215
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,480
Imagine Carson without a footman.
Like a ringmaster without a pony.

216
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,005
We'll have none of your cheek, thank
you, Thomas.

217
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm very sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I'm
not servant any more.

218
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,200
I take my orders from Major
Clarkson.

219
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,240
Who's this? Ethel, the new maid. I
told you.

220
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,200
I didn't realise I was dealing with
an ex-footman.

221
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm the one that got away.

222
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,525
Gives hope to us all.

223
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,280
Ethel, help with the luggage.
They're nearly back with Sir Richard.

224
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,080
We've got a visitor, Mr Carson.
I've seen him.

225
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,400
Where's Mr Bates? Gone. Replaced by
Mr Lang.

226
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,480
So not all the changes were bad.

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,080
Oh. We're so pleased to have you
here, Sir Richard.

228
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,005
Lady Grantham. Welcome. Thank you.

229
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,725
I hope the train wasn't too tiring.
Hello, Mary.

230
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Not a bit, no. I got a lot done.
Hello, Aunt Rosamund.

231
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:19,480
Brother, dear. How are you?

232
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Lovely to see you, Rosamund.

233
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,760
He's nice, isn't he? He spent the
entire journey reading his own papers.

234
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,040
But I'm sure I'll love him dearly if
he'll ever look up from the page.

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,725
Branson, when you've finished
unloading

236
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,360
go to the hospital and remind Lady
Sybil that we expect her for dinner.

237
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:49,405
And tell her I mean it.

238
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Really. They're working her like a
packhorse in a mine.

239
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,080
I think she enjoys it though.

240
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,840
Please tell her to come home in time
to change.

241
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,120
I can't possibly come. Really, Mama
is incorrigible.

242
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,360
It's not poor Branson's fault.

243
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,720
What is the point of Mama's soirees?
What are they for?

244
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,760
Well, I'm going up for dinner and
I'm glad. Is that wrong?

245
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,405
Thomas.

246
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,800
You can cover for Nurse Crawley,
can't you?

247
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,400
I can.

248
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,840
So you're back then, safe and sound.

249
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,885
That's not how I'd put it with my
hand the way it is

250
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,680
but, yes, Major Clarkson's found me
a place and I'm grateful.

251
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Can you give Lieutenant Courtenay
his pills?

252
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,640
Of course I can. Be glad to.

253
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Is everything under control?

254
00:16:51,075 --> 00:16:53,040
Mr Lang seems a bit nervous.

255
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Stage fright. But what about you?

256
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh...I'm a trouper.

257
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,200
And we can't complain, can we? Not when
you think what's going on in France.

258
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,080
Still...a broken heart can be as
painful as a broken limb.

259
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't feel sorry for me, Mrs Hughes.
I'm not.

260
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
I know what real love is and there
aren't many who can say that.

261
00:17:19,155 --> 00:17:21,120
I'm one of the lucky ones.

262
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
If you say so.

263
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,840
So the fashion for cocktails before
dinner hasn't reached Yorkshire?

264
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:36,520
I could get Carson to make you one
but I won't guarantee the result.

265
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,320
Mrs Crawley, Captain Crawley and
Miss Swire.

266
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Ah. Isobel.

267
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,885
Well now, still in one piece.

268
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,605
Thank God. Touch wood. I never
stopped touching it.

269
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
Do you know Sir Richard Carlisle? My
cousin, Captain Crawley.

270
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:55,085
How do you do? And his fiancee Miss
Swire.

271
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,120
I know Miss Swire. Her uncle and I
are old friends.

272
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,120
Well, old acquaintances anyway.

273
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,920
What do you think Mary sees in him?
Besides the money, you mean?

274
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:10,840
It must be more than that. For
you...not necessarily for her.

275
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,240
What's General Strutt like? Well,
you know. Rather important.

276
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
And brave. He got the DSO in South
Africa.

277
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,360
Is there any chance it might be permanent
that we can count you out of danger?

278
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,560
It would be such a relief. I wouldn't
want that, I'm afraid.

279
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,725
He's promised to get me back to
France.

280
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
How's your appointment with the
North Ridings working out?

281
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:34,920
Oh, that. W...

282
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,040
It seems I won't be going to the
front after all.

283
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,965
I made a mistake.

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
They only wanted a mascot.

285
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Mary tells me you're in newspapers.

286
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,725
Well, I own a few. Oh.

287
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,325
That must be quite a responsibility

288
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,560
at a time like this, you know, in a
war.

289
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,120
When it's so important to keep
people's spirits up.

290
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,005
Lady Grantham, my responsibility is
to my investors.

291
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,480
I need to keep my readership up. I leave
public spirits to government propaganda.

292
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,525
So now you've met Granny.

293
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,765
I warn you she has very strong
opinions.

294
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,880
Oh, you need have no fear where
that's concerned, my dear.

295
00:19:14,915 --> 00:19:16,880
We're more than evenly matched.

296
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,300
Where are the spoons for this? Just
here.

297
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,485
Oh, my God. I've forgotten the
sauce.

298
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
Mr Lang's bringing the sauce and the
Melba toast. Right, good.

299
00:19:27,115 --> 00:19:29,357
Now, Mr Lang, are you ready? I think
so.

300
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,600
It's always the left and not ladies
first.

301
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:33,605
No, just follow Mr Carson.

302
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,520
Start with old Lady Grantham, then
his lordship, then just go on round.

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,160
You must have done this before. Not
since the war started.

304
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,805
I don't think I even knew that. Why
in't it just ladies first?

305
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,500
Wouldn't it be more
polite? That's how it's done

306
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,160
on the continent. We don't
like foreign ways here.

307
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,160
I gather your footman, Thomas, has
returned to the village. No.

308
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:59,245
Crikey. Where did you see him?

309
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
At the hospital. Seems he's working
there.

310
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,040
I wonder how he wangled that.

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,045
What do you make of our plutocrat?

312
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,605
He's an opportunity. Mary's needs a
position

313
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,680
and, preferably a powerful one. He
can provide it.

314
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,160
You don't think she'd be happier
with a more traditional set-up?

315
00:20:24,195 --> 00:20:26,160
Will she have the option?

316
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,240
Thank you but I already have some.
No, no. Give that to me.

317
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,240
Oh! I do apologise, my lady.

318
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,680
Mr Lang, get a cl-

319
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,960
Carson. Carson, what's the
matter?

320
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,920
Now, Carson, it's all right.
Everything will be fine.

321
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:49,097
Edith, go with Branson and fetch
Major Clarkson.

322
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:52,240
I'll telephone and explain. What
about my dress?

323
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:54,605
Edith will get you a coat. Come.

324
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,320
Sybil will know what to do until the
doctor comes.

325
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,325
There's never a dull moment in this
house.

326
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,080
Lady Sybil and I will take him upstairs.
Mrs Hughes will show us the way.

327
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,520
I can help. No, let me. I know what
I'm doing.

328
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:08,885
I'm sure that's not necessary, my
lady.

329
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,240
It's not my lady now, Carson.
It's Nurse Crawley.

330
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,900
Anna and Ethel, I must trust the
dinner to you.

331
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,800
I'd say the first course is a thing
of the past.

332
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:24,005
Then clear and lay the hot plates.

333
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,960
Daisy, you fetch the beef and the
rest of it. Anna, you serve the wine.

334
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,805
Mr Lang, you can clear up the mess.

335
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,880
I'll do that. There's no need. I
don't mind. I thank you.

336
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,680
Mr Lang, you'd better go downstairs.

337
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,805
Well, Clarkson's seen him.

338
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,760
It's definitely not a heart attack
but he does need rest.

339
00:21:47,795 --> 00:21:49,760
He's working much too hard.

340
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
For a start he's just got to let the
maids serve in the dining room.

341
00:21:54,275 --> 00:21:56,240
Quite right. There is a war.

342
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,320
Even Carson has to make sacrifices.

343
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Poor Lang. He looked like a rabbit
in front of a snake.

344
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,120
I don't understand it. He seemed so
solid when I met him,

345
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:10,480
even taciturn, now he's a bundle of
nerves.

346
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,680
I heard what you said to Matthew
about the regiment.

347
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
Everyone else knows what a fool I
made of myself, why shouldn't he?

348
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:20,600
I don't think you're a fool. Isn't
that enough?

349
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:21,960
No.

350
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,600
Maybe it should be but it isn't.

351
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Are you all right, Mr Lang?

352
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
You're not, are you?

353
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,760
I've seen shell shock before, you
know.

354
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
I had a brother with it.

355
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,320
My favourite brother, as it happens.

356
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,240
And I was his favourite too.

357
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,520
They sent him back and he's dead
now.

358
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,960
They won't send me back.

359
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm a goner as far as they're
concerned.

360
00:23:14,735 --> 00:23:16,960
You shouldn't be working yet. I must
work.

361
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I don't know what to do else.

362
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
I have to work.

363
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,285
Mr Lang. I thought you'd gone up.

364
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,960
He wanted to hang up the livery
before it got creased.

365
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,160
Well, we can discuss the dinner
another time.

366
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,680
I'll say good night. Good night, Mrs
Hughes. Good night.

367
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,325
May I come in?

368
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,640
That's very kind of you, my lady,
but do you think you should?

369
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,880
Let's hope my reputation will
survive it.

370
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
And rest easy, please.

371
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,000
I gather it isn't too serious. Oh,
I've been very stupid, my lady.

372
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:18,045
I let myself get flustered.

373
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,365
I regard that as highly
unprofessional.

374
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
It won't happen again. Don't be too
hard on yourself.

375
00:24:23,435 --> 00:24:26,400
I was particularly sorry to spoil
things for Sir Richard,

376
00:24:26,435 --> 00:24:28,600
knowing he was a guest of yours.
Don't be.

377
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
I think he found it all quite
exciting.

378
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,880
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

379
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,760
I don't know. Maybe.

380
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
And Captain Crawley...

381
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,400
is he happy with the changes, so to
speak?

382
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,480
May I give you one piece of advice,
my lady?

383
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Tell him what's in your heart.

384
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,240
If you still love him, let him know.

385
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
Then even if he's killed, and he may
be, you won't be sorry.

386
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,160
But if you don't tell him you could
regret it all your life long.

387
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,760
And what about Miss Swire?

388
00:25:14,795 --> 00:25:16,760
Well...Miss Swire.

389
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,880
As if any man in his right mind could
prefer Miss Swire to you.

390
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,320
Oh, I'm so sorry, my lady. I didn't
know you were in here.

391
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:32,960
I was just going. Carson's been
boosting my confidence.

392
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,240
That's something I'd never have
thought she was short of.

393
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,560
What about you, sir?

394
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,200
What did you do before the war
started?

395
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,760
I was up at Oxford.

396
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,120
But I only ever planned to farm.

397
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,120
Farm and shoot.

398
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,960
And hunt and fish.

399
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,080
And everything I'll never do again.

400
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,360
You don't know that. We've had cases
of gas blindness wearing off.

401
00:26:13,395 --> 00:26:15,045
Rare cases.

402
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,125
And much sooner than this.

403
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,360
It doesn't help me to be lied to, you
know.

404
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm finished.

405
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,400
And I'd rather face it than dodge it.

406
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,480
I'd better go.

407
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,720
Where's Rosamund? She's with your
mama.

408
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,080
Trying to talk her into the idea of
Sir Richard.

409
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,120
You don't sound very enthusiastic.

410
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,880
Are you?

411
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,565
Can we stop for a minute?

412
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,400
Don't tell me you're tired. I'm not
tired, I'm hot.

413
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:51,445
This tweed is too thick.

414
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,120
It looks more suited to shooting
than walking.

415
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,160
I had it made for the weekend. I
didn't know there was a difference.

416
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,720
It doesn't matter. That's like the
rich who say money doesn't matter.

417
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:04,137
It matters enough when you haven't
got it.

418
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,520
I know you don't care about our
silly rules.

419
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,520
You're always very clear on that
score.

420
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
You make me sound rude and I hope
I'm not that.

421
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,800
I mean to learn how to do things
properly and you could help me a lot.

422
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,560
But I'm not ashamed of being what
they call a self-made man.

423
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:23,320
I'm proud of it.

424
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Is the point of all this to test me
in some way?

425
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,000
Maybe.

426
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Are you shocked by my bold and
modern values?

427
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,600
Oh, Sir Richard, you flatter
yourself.

428
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,520
It takes a good deal more than that
to shock me.

429
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,400
But, Mama, who do you imagine is out
there with more to offer?

430
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:55,720
I'm not a romantic. I should hope
not.

431
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,680
But even I will concede that the
heart does not exist

432
00:27:58,715 --> 00:28:00,977
solely for the purpose of pumping
blood.

433
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,240
That is charming, especially from
you.

434
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,920
But Mary seems to have...blotted her
copybook in some way.

435
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,720
So she needs a suitable marriage
that will mend her fences.

436
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,645
Well, how do we know Carlisle is
suitable?

437
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,365
Who is he? Who'd ever heard of him
before the war?

438
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Sir Richard is powerful and rich and
well on the way to a peerage.

439
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,740
Of course, he may not be all that
one would wish

440
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:32,467
but Mary can soon smooth off the
rough edges.

441
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,160
Well, you should know. What do you
mean by that?

442
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,725
Marmaduke was a gentleman.

443
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,045
Marmaduke was the grandson of a
manufacturer.

444
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,800
His mother was the daughter of a
baronet. Maybe...

445
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,080
but they were no great threat to the
Plantagenets.

446
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,320
The point is I made up for any
social deficiencies.

447
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,365
And he provided me with a position.

448
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,685
It was a good exchange and it worked
well.

449
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
How can Matthew have chosen that
little blonde piece?

450
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:02,720
You speak so eloquently of the human
heart, Mama.

451
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,440
You must be aware of its...vagaries.

452
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,840
'Things cannot be as they were and
Jack has your best interests at heart.'

453
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,200
Stop.

454
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,320
Who's Jack?

455
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
My younger brother.

456
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,400
He means to replace me.

457
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,520
It's what he's always wanted.

458
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah...well...

459
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,040
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
I mustn't bore you.

461
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't let them walk all over you.

462
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,640
You've got to fight your corner.

463
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,560
What with? Your brain.

464
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,600
You're not a victim. Don't let them
make you into one.

465
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
You know, when you talk like that...

466
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,360
..I almost believe you.

467
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,280
You should believe me.

468
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,920
All my life they've...

469
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
..pushed me around just cos I'm
different.

470
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,280
How? Why are you different?

471
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,520
Never mind.

472
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,725
Look...

473
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,880
Look, I...I don't know if you're
going to see again or not.

474
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,960
But I do know you have to fight
back.

475
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,160
How dare you threaten me? How dare
I?

476
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,965
I assure I dare a great deal more
than that.

477
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,580
But you can't, you wouldn't. I
didn't say I would.

478
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,160
I was merely reminding you it was in
my power.

479
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,960
Lady Painswick. Lady Rosamund.

480
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm sorry. I'll get these things
sorted out before long.

481
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,200
It's not important.

482
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,880
Miss Swire and I were just talking
about old times.

483
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,240
Happy old times, I hope.

484
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,440
Will you forgive me? I want to write
some letters before dinner.

485
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,920
Let's have a rest. We've earned it.

486
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,640
I should have got a glass. You can't
drink out of a bottle, my lady.

487
00:31:32,675 --> 00:31:34,685
I wish you'd call me Edith.

488
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
And of course I can drink from the
bottle.

489
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,920
Would you like me to teach you to
drive?

490
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Not much...cos then you wouldn't
come here no more.

491
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,840
Although that wouldn't matter to you.

492
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,800
Why do you say that?

493
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,920
You're pretty and clever and fine.

494
00:31:58,955 --> 00:32:01,720
You're from a different world.

495
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,200
Is something wrong? No, just having
a break.

496
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,500
Because you want to get into town to
fetch the bone meal.

497
00:32:09,535 --> 00:32:12,520
And be back in time to feed the cows
before it's dark.

498
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,720
They could always have a midnight
feast.

499
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,840
That's it, sir. If you move the stick fast
enough you don't have to slacken your pace.

500
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:27,840
Check the width of the space as well
as any obstruction.

501
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Lieutenant Courtenay, well done.

502
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
You're making good progress. Thanks
to my saviours, sir.

503
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,800
So you'll be pleased to hear that it's
time to continue your treatment elsewhere.

504
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
What? At Farley Hall.

505
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,280
You're not ill any more. All you need
is time to adjust to your condition.

506
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:50,320
The staff at Farley can help with
that.

507
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,000
But, sir, these two are helping me
here.

508
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,000
Nurse Crawley and Corporal Barrow
are not trained in specialist care.

509
00:32:59,035 --> 00:33:01,280
Please. Don't send me away.

510
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,360
Not yet.

511
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,640
Sir, surely we...

512
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,600
Lieutenant...you must know that
every one of our beds is needed

513
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,680
for the injured and dying from
Arras.

514
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,920
Hm?

515
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,600
Corporal, I'll see you in my office.

516
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,180
Sir, I only meant to say that
Lieutenant Courtenay is depressed.

517
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:33,800
I will not leave wounded soldiers
freezing or sweating under canvas

518
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,965
because a junior officer is
depressed!

519
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,480
Yes? I thought you
may want to know what I think.

520
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:41,565
Why should I?

521
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Nurse Crawley, I may not be your
social superior in a Mayfair ballroom

522
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:48,600
but in this hospital I have the
deciding voice.

523
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,160
Please help him prepare his
belongings. He leaves in the morning.

524
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:01,140
Anna and Ethel will wait at the table.
I will supervise. What's wrong with that?

525
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:05,360
Nothing. Except that it's how a chartered
accountant has his dinner served.

526
00:34:05,395 --> 00:34:08,637
I can think of worse insults. If you
say so.

527
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,880
But I don't want Lang allowed
anywhere near it.

528
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,680
Oh, Mr Bates. Where are you when we
need you?

529
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,400
Can you bring me the wine ledgers and
I'll make a selection?

530
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,240
His lordship's already done that.
Just try to rest.

531
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,765
To rest or to feel redundant?

532
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,240
Both if it'll slow you down for a
minute and a half.

533
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,240
The world does not turn on the style
of a dinner.

534
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,560
My world does.

535
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,160
How does he know Miss Swire?

536
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:42,205
What? Miss Swire.

537
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,120
They were in the garden when I came
back from Mama's.

538
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:47,080
I suppose they met in London.

539
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,120
Would you like me to come back
later, my lady? No, come in.

540
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:55,040
I was just leaving.

541
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,380
How's Carson getting on? Oh, much
better, my lady.

542
00:35:04,415 --> 00:35:07,000
Mrs Hughes is having a job keeping
him in bed.

543
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,840
He gave me some advice last night.

544
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,525
Oh, yes?

545
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,520
Was it good advice?

546
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,005
It was about honesty.

547
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,240
He thinks I should say what I really
feel.

548
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,520
Sounds a bit wild for Mr Carson.

549
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,640
Do you think he's right?

550
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,560
Well, they do say honesty is the
best policy.

551
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,085
And I think you regret being honest

552
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,320
less often than you regret telling
lies.

553
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,120
He must have smuggled a razor into
his bed.

554
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
There was nothing to be done.

555
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,120
It's because we ordered him to go.
We don't know that.

556
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
This is a tragedy, I don't deny it.

557
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,840
But I cannot see what other course
was open to me.

558
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,285
We have no room for men to
convalesce

559
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,000
and Farley is the nearest house I
can send them to.

560
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,640
There is a solution and it's staring
us in the face.

561
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,040
Downton Abbey. Would they ever allow
it?

562
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,840
Or even consider it? I think they
would.

563
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,120
After this I think they can be made
to.

564
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,760
But, Sir Richard, you don't have to
- Richard, please.

565
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,040
You see, I want you to marry me.

566
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Why?

567
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,480
Because I think very highly of you.

568
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,040
Very highly...goodness.

569
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,640
I mean it. I think we'd do well
together.

570
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,540
We could be a good team.

571
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:19,560
Now, that sounds better.

572
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,965
But I can't help thinking

573
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
that tradition demands a little
mention of love.

574
00:37:27,035 --> 00:37:30,360
Oh, I can talk about love and moon
and June

575
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:32,360
and all the rest of it if you wish.

576
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:34,337
But we're more than that.

577
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:36,280
We're strong and sharp.

578
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,480
And we can build something worth
having, you and I, if you'll let us.

579
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,640
Your proposal is improving by leaps
and bounds.

580
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,245
You must give me some time.

581
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,760
But I promise to think about it
properly.

582
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
I'm counting on it.

583
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
If you just go to that one over
there.

584
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,920
You're right here. Right to the
other end. Down you go.

585
00:38:27,955 --> 00:38:30,640
Her ladyship had Mrs Patmore make
this up for you

586
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,920
so you could eat something during
the day.

587
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,840
Dr Clarkson. Good morning.

588
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,200
Oh, Matthew.

589
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,920
I'm afraid I'm very busy, as you can
see. Yes, I just want to help.

590
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:44,920
Right over there.

591
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,685
Is it what you thought it would be?

592
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,920
No. No, it's more savage and more
cruel than I could have imagined but...

593
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,840
I feel useful for the first time in
my life. That must be a good thing.

594
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,960
Matthew, are you busy? No, of course
not.

595
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,320
I'll just get you on to your bed.

596
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,525
You're quite safe.

597
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,640
So you wouldn't go back...

598
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,685
to your life before the war?

599
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,840
No. No, I could never go back to
that again.

600
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,400
Lavinia.

601
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
What's the matter?

602
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,920
Are you looking for Matthew?

603
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,600
I was...but it's not important.

604
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,640
Tell me what it is...please.

605
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,560
He has to go a day early. Tomorrow
morning, in fact.

606
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,960
Only to meet his general, surely.
Not back to France.

607
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,200
But he must go back one day.

608
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,040
I can't imagine what I'd do if
anything happened to him.

609
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,040
I know he'll be all right.

610
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,040
No, you don't. None of us do.

611
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,920
We say that sort of thing but we
don't know.

612
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,400
If he died I don't think I could go
on living.

613
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
What's doing?

614
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:33,960
Excuse me.

615
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Lavinia's a bit upset.

616
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,365
She's awfully cut up that I have to
go early.

617
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,640
But it's only to Coventry - which
doesn't sound too dangerous.

618
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,560
If you're looking for mother she's
at the hospital.

619
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,280
Actually it's you I came to see. Oh?
How can I help?

620
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,280
Mary, can you stay for luncheon?

621
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,400
I can't...but thank you.

622
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,480
So what was your mission?

623
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,040
Just to say...

624
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,840
..we hope you're still coming for
dinner tonight.

625
00:41:20,875 --> 00:41:22,760
Certainly we are. Why wouldn't we?

626
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Sure? It'll be your last evening.

627
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,200
Why? Don't you want me? Of course I
want you...very much.

628
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm sorry you've had a wasted
journey. Not at all.

629
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,680
I needed an excuse for a walk.

630
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,320
I'll see you at eight.

631
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Ethel said you wanted me. No, no, I
just need a word with you.

632
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,840
If it's about the book I'm afraid -
It's not about the book.

633
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,600
What is it then?

634
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,200
I understand that Mr Bates has
gone...for good.

635
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,480
Yes, I believe that's true.

636
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,280
So I was hoping...

637
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,040
..we might be able to see a little
more of each other.

638
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,640
Mr Molesley...

639
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,840
..I take this as a real
compliment...

640
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,560
But it's not going to happen.

641
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:30,120
No.

642
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,760
You see...

643
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,920
..if you had a child and that child
was taken from you,

644
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
if the child was sent to the moon,

645
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,200
there'd never be one day when they
were out of your thoughts,

646
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,640
no moment when you weren't praying
for their welfare,

647
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,960
even if you knew you'd never see
them again.

648
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,560
That's you and Mr Bates.

649
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,960
That's me and Mr Bates.

650
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,240
But thank you.

651
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,080
I've kept you too long. You should
get back or they'll be looking for you.

652
00:43:19,115 --> 00:43:21,120
We've done a lot, haven't we? We
have.

653
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,720
I'll have to invent some tasks or they'll
be no need for you to come much more.

654
00:43:25,755 --> 00:43:27,680
Then start inventing, please.

655
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,160
I will.

656
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,040
Cos I'd hate it if you were to stay
away.

657
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
So would I.

658
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,560
I'd absolutely hate it.

659
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,320
I can't believe I've done that. I'm
awfully glad you did.

660
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
You'll have me thrown in the tower.

661
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,920
Only if they give me the key.

662
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:02,245
Fold it in. Don't slap it.

663
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,640
You're making a cake not beating a
carpet.

664
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,920
Oh, sorry, Your Lordship, I didn't
see you there.

665
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,965
It's quite all right, Mrs Patmore.

666
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,960
I wonder, is there somewhere we could
have a word? Er...

667
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:16,400
er... Why not go into my sitting
room?

668
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,640
Please sit.

669
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,525
I do have some news of your nephew.

670
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,840
I telephoned the War Office. They've just
come back to me but it's not good news.

671
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,285
I knew he was dead all along.

672
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,000
I said so to my sister. I said, 'Kate,
he's gone and you'll have to fa -

673
00:44:38,035 --> 00:44:39,960
Mrs Patmore, it's worse than that.

674
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,840
What can be worse than being dead?

675
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,200
Private Philpotts was shot for
cowardice on 17 February.

676
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,685
Oh, my God.

677
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,520
This explains why the regiment was
reluctant to supply information.

678
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,520
Mrs Hughes, could you come in,
please?

679
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
Mrs Patmore has had some bad news.
Her nephew has been killed.

680
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,480
Oh, he never has? And that's not
all.

681
00:45:20,515 --> 00:45:22,480
It is all, Mrs Patmore.

682
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,405
Let us make sure it is all.

683
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,760
Your sister needs to know no more
than this.

684
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,920
We cannot know the truth. We should
not judge.

685
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,445
I think it's a ridiculous idea.

686
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:42,725
Why? Because this is a house not a
hospital.

687
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,240
Granny, a convalescent home is where
people rest and recuperate.

688
00:45:46,275 --> 00:45:48,240
But if there are relapses, what
then?

689
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,280
Amputation in the dining room?
Resuscitation in the pantry?

690
00:45:52,315 --> 00:45:54,637
It would be the most tremendous
disturbance.

691
00:45:54,672 --> 00:45:56,960
If you knew how chaotic things are
as it is.

692
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:58,960
But when so much good can be done.

693
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,640
I forbid it.

694
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,640
To have strange men prodding and
prying around the house.

695
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,960
To say nothing of pocketing the
spoons.

696
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,885
It's out of the question. I hesitate
to remind you

697
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,480
but this is my house, Robert's and
mine, and we will make the decision.

698
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Oh, I see.

699
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,600
So now I'm an outsider...who need
not be consulted.

700
00:46:29,635 --> 00:46:31,560
Since you put it like that, yes.

701
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,640
What was it like at the hospital
today?

702
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,880
At the front...

703
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,040
..the men pray to be spared, of
course.

704
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,160
But if that's not to be...

705
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,280
..they pray for a bullet that kills
them cleanly.

706
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,240
For too many of them today that
prayer had not been answered.

707
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,325
We'll eat in about 20 minutes.

708
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,400
Good. And would you have any to
spare for a poor traveller?

709
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,920
William, I don't believe it. Pinch
me. I am your dream come true.

710
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,760
You're like a real soldier. I am a
real soldier, thank you very much.

711
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:23,805
Now come and give me a kiss. Ooh.

712
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,380
We'll have none of that. Won't you
let a tommy kiss his sweetheart,

713
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:30,807
when he's off to fight the Hun? Have
you finished your training?

714
00:47:30,842 --> 00:47:34,200
Not yet but it won't be long. On the
eve of departure we'll see

715
00:47:34,235 --> 00:47:36,120
but right now put her down.

716
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,845
I'll show you.

717
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,080
What do you think? There. Smart, in't
it?

718
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,520
William? What a treat to see you.

719
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,080
And how smart you look.

720
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,405
Welcome. Thanks. Supper won't be
long.

721
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,000
I'm just clearing the dining room.
Shall I help?

722
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,920
Course not. You're in the army now.

723
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,440
So, still full of the joys of war
then?

724
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,120
I'm not sorry to be part of it, Mr
Lang, and I can't pretend I am.

725
00:48:11,155 --> 00:48:13,165
Oh, yes, you're part of it.

726
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,120
Like a metal cog is part of a
factory.

727
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,680
Or a grain of sand is part of the
beach.

728
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,760
It's all right, Mr Lang. I
understand.

729
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,000
And I'm not saying I'm important or
owt like that.

730
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,845
But I believe in this war.

731
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,600
I believe in what we're fighting for
and I want to do my bit.

732
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,000
Then God help you.

733
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,960
Edith seems jolly tonight.

734
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,240
She's found her metier - farm
labouring.

735
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,245
Don't be so tough on her.

736
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,880
That's like asking the fox to spare
the chicken.

737
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,280
What about you? Last time you told
me good news was imminent.

738
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,120
Would you be happy if it were? Of
course.

739
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,120
I've found someone now and I want
you to do the same.

740
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,560
If you'd taken another minute to
make up your mind,

741
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:18,600
we'd all have marched over the cliff.

742
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,320
I'll tell you something else as
well...

743
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,120
William's got more to say than a
parliamentary candidate.

744
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,600
What's the matter? I know it's my
fault...

745
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,200
but I wish I hadn't let him think
that we're like sweethearts.

746
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,080
Because we're not. Not by my
reckoning, anyway.

747
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,920
Too late for second thoughts now,
missy.

748
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,460
You don't have to marry him when it
comes to it

749
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:45,120
but you can't let him go to war with
a broken heart

750
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:46,960
or he won't come back.

751
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,160
What a time we've had.

752
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,200
Poor Sir Richard must have thought
he'd come to a madhouse.

753
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,120
I don't expect it'll put him off.

754
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,360
I'm going to accept him.

755
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,120
Do you think I should?

756
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,880
That's not for me to say.

757
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,240
If you love him more than anyone in
the world then of course you should.

758
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,680
It's not as simple as that. Oh?

759
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,525
It is for me.

760
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,520
But then I'm not your ladyship.

761
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,720
Did you love Bates more than anyone
else in the world?

762
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,820
I did.

763
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,520
I do.

764
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,240
I'll never love again like I love
him.

765
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,240
Ever.

766
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,400
Well, there you are then.

767
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,040
One day you'll meet someone else and
you'll marry.

768
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,520
Perhaps it'll be second best but...

769
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
..it doesn't mean you can't have a
life.

770
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,320
I think it does...for me.

771
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,960
Are you sure you should be doing this?
We've managed well with Mrs Hughes.

772
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,645
Quite sure, my lord.

773
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,920
And breakfast is not a taxing
assignment.

774
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:28,480
Edith, this is a message for you. Mrs Drake
writes that they've decided to hire a man

775
00:51:28,515 --> 00:51:30,480
so they won't be needing you any
more.

776
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:34,320
Is that all she says? Oh, well,
she's very grateful.

777
00:51:34,355 --> 00:51:37,520
Here. She says she and Drake send
their thanks to you

778
00:51:37,555 --> 00:51:39,840
for giving up so much of your
valuable time.

779
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,240
I expect it's rather a relief.

780
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,800
Oh, I wouldn't say that...

781
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,120
not entirely. Has Lady Sybil gone
already?

782
00:51:49,155 --> 00:51:51,565
She had a tray at half past six. She
would.

783
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,480
Carson, did you know we're to be
turned into a hospital?

784
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:56,365
A convalescent home.

785
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,400
I'm afraid we've all bullied you
into the whole thing.

786
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:01,845
I hope you're not dreading it too
much.

787
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,080
Not exactly but it's a brave new world
we're headed for, no doubt about that.

788
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,080
We just try to meet it with as much
grace as we can muster.

789
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,100
I thought I saw Mr Bates. Isn't he
in London?

790
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:22,645
Thomas, the footman, managing
Downton Abbey?

791
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,400
Give orders for the beds, the nurses
and the patients

792
00:52:25,435 --> 00:52:27,320
to be packed up and shipped out at
once!

793
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,285
Do you remember when Aunt Rosamund

794
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,645
found you and Richard Carlisle in
the garden?

795
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,640
I hope you didn't unearth anything
too fearful. Ask Mary.

796
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,597
I'll get them one way or another.

797
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,485
There's no need to be so rough.

798
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,720
There's every need...to stop a
murder.

799
00:52:40,755 --> 00:52:42,205
Are we engaged?

800
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,820
It's not against the law
to take a mistress. I know

801
00:52:44,821 --> 00:52:47,400
you and I love you. That is
not the right path for you.

802
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:57,480

1
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:08,011
Downton Abbey: the most successful
British drama series for a decade.

2
00:00:08,012 --> 00:00:12,632
Welcome to Downton. You'll find there's
never a dull moment in this house.

3
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:17,932
HUGH BONNEVILLE: Two unmissable series
rising to 12 million viewers in the UK.

4
00:00:18,012 --> 00:00:21,012
And some of period dramas most
memorable moments.

5
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:23,011
I can't believe it.
It's so wonderful.

6
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:25,394
I won't allow it!
He proposed to me.

7
00:00:26,023 --> 00:00:29,004
Good heavens, what am I sitting on?

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:33,009
Now let's get behind the
drama with exclusive

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,008
interviews with the cast
of this hugely loved show.

10
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:39,001
Literally he has to
fall flat on his face.

11
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:42,003
When are they gonna kiss?
They finally kiss.

12
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,013
An explosion went off right in front
of our faces.

13
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,020
Hear what they really think of their
characters.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,008
She's damaged goods. She's just a
really good egg, I think.

15
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,022
She's not very nice.
Now who's jealous?

16
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:56,005
And see them in action
behind the scenes.

17
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:59,007
There will be explosions
on this take.

18
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,005
To uncover the secret
of Downton Abbey's success.

19
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:03,011
Whoo!

20
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:07,011
Guys like me don't always get asked
to do heroic action stuff, you know.

21
00:01:07,012 --> 00:01:10,010
Come at once! Come at once!
Come and see this at once!

22
00:01:17,014 --> 00:01:19,007
It's July 2011.

23
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,023
The cast is filming a scene for the
Christmas episode.

24
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:28,018
And, action.

25
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:34,014
I don't want to spoil their
fun but I couldn't wear

26
00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:38,004
a paper hat not with poor
Mr Bates locked away.

27
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,005
His Lordship said much thesame.

28
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:44,007
Everyone is still reeling from the
shock of Mr Bates's arrest.

29
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:46,011
If things don't go right
for Mr Bates, have

30
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:48,013
you given any thought
to his replacement?

31
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:51,021
There'll be plenty of time for that
conversation after the trial.

32
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:54,011
Cut there, reset, thank you.

33
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:56,005
Resetting.

34
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:01,012
So far we've met 33 characters in
the Downton saga.

35
00:02:01,013 --> 00:02:05,021
Whatever their position in society,
they all have a place in the story.

36
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,014
When we were devising Downton,

37
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:12,024
we knew it was very important that
we would treat everyone equally.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,011
We just wanted a group of people who
were all, for one reason or another,

39
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:18,006
living in this one house

40
00:02:18,007 --> 00:02:21,008
but with different expectations of
life

41
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,016
and they go through different
traumas but equal traumas.

44
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:38,024
and in a great house with more than
50 bedrooms, they had plenty to do.

45
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:41,001
The house is kind of like a swan.

46
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,022
It's beautiful and graceful and
floating above the surface

47
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:47,007
and underneath the legs are kind of
going wild making it all happen

48
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:49,017
and the servants are like the legs
of the house.

49
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:52,013
You get barely time to,
well, I won't say it

50
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:55,000
but, yes, you know what I mean.

51
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:57,020
We all know who's boss upstairs.

52
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:01,000
The Dowager Countess.
I couldn't put it better myself.

53
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:08,017
But, if anything, the hierarchy's even
stricter in the servants' quarters.

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,009
William, are you aware the seam at
your shoulder is coming apart?

55
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,010
Below stairs you
can generally tell

56
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:20,005
who is important to be seen
in the principal rooms

57
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:23,014
and in those days, it was
young men, the footmen.

58
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,008
They were the peacocks.
They are designed to reflect

59
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,000
the status the Granthams
are trying to convey.

60
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:32,002
Obviously, at the head of the chain
is Carson.

61
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:35,001
Downton Abbey. Carson the butler
speaking.

62
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,023
And Daisy, everybody knows, is at
the bottom.

63
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:41,001
And that is why she has the rotten,
miserable jobs,

64
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:44,008
doing all the gritty, earthy work
that has to be done.

65
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,020
We should go out to greet them.

66
00:03:45,021 --> 00:03:48,023
And me, Mr Carson?
No, Daisy, not you.

67
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:50,519
She's never allowed to
be seen upstairs and

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,013
you can tell because
she's dressed that way.

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,511
Today, Britain's great
houses have lost

70
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:59,001
their traditional
kitchens and sculleries.

71
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:03,008
So, Daisy's world has been recreated
at the famous Ealing studios.

72
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:08,006
The upstairs cast rarely get to visit
the myriad of sets here

73
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:10,233
but it's where every downstairs scene
is shot

74
00:04:10,866 --> 00:04:13,010
and the attention to detail is
amazing.

75
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,005
We used to have taps that worked but
they don't seem to be working any more.

76
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:26,012
The other day I went to turn the tap on
in a scene and I was gonna wash my hands

77
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:29,001
and they just didn't turn on,
so I was like, 'Oh, hm. '

78
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,024
But, yeah, this all works.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,017
This gets very hot and you can
actually cook things.

80
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:37,001
I did a scene with Lady Sybil.
Why does everything go so lumpy?

81
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:40,001
And this comes out and they shoot
through there.

82
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:44,003
Ooh, there's this bit. I love the
household wants indicator.

83
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:47,017
It's an old-fashioned shopping list
and it's really cool.

84
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:51,021
If they ran out of things, they'd
just do that with the little tag.

85
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:54,002
How clever is that?

86
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:58,017
Even the food on set is authentic
for the period,

87
00:04:58,018 --> 00:05:00,518
though once it's gone
cold after a few takes,

88
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,017
it doesn't taste
quite so delicious.

89
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,007
Just don't let Mrs Patmore hear you
say that.

90
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,021
Mrs Patmore looks ready to eat her
alive.

91
00:05:08,022 --> 00:05:10,020
I was only trying to help. Oh!

92
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,519
Judas was only trying to
help, I suppose, when

93
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,017
he brought the Roman
soldiers to the garden.

94
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:18,024
When I first got the job,
people would say to me,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,019
'Are you above stairs
or below stairs?'

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,020
And I'd say, 'What do you think?'

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,003
Daisy and Mrs Patmore,

98
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:30,015
I think they have kind of a
mother-daughter relationship.

99
00:05:30,016 --> 00:05:32,016
Although a very,
very bossy mother

100
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:34,016
who is also your boss.

101
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:37,024
I said you could go for a drink of
water not a trip up the Nile.

102
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:41,018
It's very important to get her up to
speed because if she does,

103
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:44,020
she'll have a chance of probably
going on and being promoted

104
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,022
and one day she might be
a cook herself, so the

105
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:50,022
reasoning behind it is not
just to be an old cow.

106
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:54,510
Sometimes my lines are
really easy to learn cos I

107
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:57,005
just have to say, 'Yes,
Mrs Patmore, ' 15 times.

108
00:05:57,006 --> 00:06:00,007
Yes, Mrs Patmore. And run around
pretending to make cakes.

109
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:03,007
Have you laid the service for
breakfast? Yes, Mrs Patmore.

110
00:06:03,008 --> 00:06:06,014
And finish blacking that stove.
Yes, Mrs Patmore.

111
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:11,016
Lesley has really hard lines to learn
cos she always has sayings and phrases.

112
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,011
You know, like... I'm trying to
think of one now.

113
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:18,013
It's just the sprat to catch the
mackerel. Is that a phrase?

114
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:21,006
He knows this is justthe sprat to
catch the mackerel.

115
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:25,018
He understands. He knows this is just
the sprat to catch the mackerel.

116
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:29,005
She's witty and she knows she's
witty and she enjoys it

117
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:32,004
and she enjoys put-downs and she's a
bit sarky.

118
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:35,024
Ooh, talk about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,017
I wish we had a sow's ear.
It'd be better than this brisket.

120
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:43,009
The cook had a very tough working
life.

121
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:47,003
Will you leave me and let me get on
with this travesty?

122
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:50,007
I always feel with Mrs Patmore that
if she didn't keep up the cracks,

123
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:53,023
you know, she would just go forward
with her forehead on her elbows

124
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:56,008
and think,
'God, is this ever going to end?'

125
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,004
Ooh, what a dreadful thing.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,501
In Britain's great
houses, intimate

127
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:06,002
relationships between
staff were frowned upon

128
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:09,003
and the relentless hard work left
littletime for romance.

129
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,019
But against the odds,
some servants did find love.

130
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:17,019
The Anna and Bates
story was the one that

131
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,015
captured everyone's
kind of imagination.

132
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,012
Everyone wanted them
to get together.

133
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:24,012
When I was watching it, even though
I knew what was happening.

134
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:25,022
You'd be like,
'Oh, come on. '

135
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:28,023
I'm John Bates, the new valet.
The new valet?

136
00:07:28,024 --> 00:07:30,024
That's right.

137
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,010
She clearly has empathy for this
character on his arrival.

138
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:40,007
I'm Anna, the head house maid.
How do you do?

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,002
Before Mr Bates comes along, I think
she's just happy with her lot, really.

140
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:50,002
There's an attraction. It's just
alchemy.

141
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:55,001
She does fall for this man and she has
this different option now in her life.

142
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,020
This relationship grows but it takes
a long time to develop.

143
00:08:03,008 --> 00:08:06,007
Everything we were talking about
was not what we were saying.

144
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:08,512
It's sad to think about.
It's always sad when

145
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:11,006
you love someone who
doesn't love you back,

146
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,007
no matter who you are.

147
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:15,516
Really we were kind of
saying, 'I really like you.

148
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,023
' 'I really like you. '

149
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,523
So, it's really nice to
play against the words and

150
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,021
play against what you're
actually talking about.

151
00:08:22,022 --> 00:08:27,005
Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her
back, he just couldn't say.

152
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,018
Why ever not? Sometimes we're not at
liberty to speak.

153
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,017
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

154
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:39,010
He doesn't wear his heart on his
sleeve.

155
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:44,009
He keeps it buried where it belongs
to reveal itself only when necessary.

156
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:49,024
And while Mr Bates plays his cards
close to his chest,

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,024
he still has to deal with hostility
and resentment below stairs.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,511
Remember to help me
with the luggage.

159
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:57,021
Don't go running off.
I'll give you a hand.

160
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:02,009
I couldn't ask that, Mr Bates, not
in your condition.

161
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,011
How long do we have to put up with
this, Mr Carson, just so I know?

162
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,509
Someone with such an
injury would rarely,

163
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,005
if ever, be employed
in service in a house

164
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:13,019
so it's of huge import to him that's
he given this chance.

165
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:16,518
The arrival of a duke is
an honour for the house

166
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,019
and the servants must
make a good impression.

167
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,004
But for Bates, it's a moment of
shame.

168
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,017
I remember that scene vividly
because, initially,

169
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:28,017
it was going to be staged as the
character falling to his knees,

170
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:30,016
but I thought, metaphorically
and literally,

171
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,013
he has to fall flat on his face.

172
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:38,011
It was shot so many times,
I was winded for a few days.

173
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:42,010
But it was very important that we
saw this man's absolute humiliation.

174
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,008
Bates, are you all right?
Perfectly, my Lord.

175
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,014
But the physical scars are the least
of Bates's worries.

176
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:55,406
He can't escape his chequered past.

177
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:00,189
Nothing is harder to live
with than false hope.

178
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,376
I wish you'd just
come out with it.

179
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:06,520
With what?
Mr Bates has the most amount of

180
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:09,021
baggage of anybody, in
the world, I think.

181
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,015
Whatever it is you're keeping
secret.

182
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:16,010
He makes this, to me admirable, but
essentially unmodern decision...

183
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:18,014
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

184
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:22,001
Not to burden everyone else
with his own troubles.

185
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:26,015
I just want to know the truth.
I cannot speak of it, my Lord.

186
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:29,008
But, of course, in a way it plays
against him.

187
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,019
I bet Thomas would like it if they
took you for a thief.

188
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,003
It means people can believe anything
of him.

189
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,011
Yes, I expect he would.

190
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:37,010
She's a real trooper
to stick by him but

191
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,008
that's because they're
so in love, you know.

192
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
(WINDOW OPENS)

193
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,017
The servants might have
it tough but being

194
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:50,020
at the helm of this
ship isn't easy either.

195
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,003
Pregnant?

196
00:10:52,004 --> 00:10:53,379
Especially with daughters like
these.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,020
The Turk is a true story.
I think he's dead.

198
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:59,020
The sisters are wicked with each
other. She's a bit of a bitch.

199
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,021
So, he slipped the hook.

200
00:11:07,315 --> 00:11:12,310
Downton Abbey's sumptuous setting is
perhaps the biggest star of the show.

201
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,306
The cast and crew have spent more
than 100 days

202
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:21,324
filming many of the upstairs scenes
at the magnificent Highclere castle.

203
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,317
It's like working in a piece of
living history.

204
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,313
When you walk into the hall it's
wonderful.

205
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,318
There's certainly a really great
feeling when you're in the real thing.

206
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,302
OK, stand by.

207
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,301
The seat of the Earls of Carnarvon
for three centuries,

208
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,315
it's the perfect location for Downton
Abbey.

209
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,300
Here the family faces losing
everything to a perfect stranger.

210
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:50,320
When he arrives in the village,
no-one is happy.

211
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:52,814
They'll push one of
the daughters at me.

212
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:55,307
They'll have fixed on that when
they heard I was a bachelor.

213
00:11:55,308 --> 00:11:56,319
Lady Mary Crawley.

214
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,323
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

215
00:12:00,324 --> 00:12:03,303
They get off to a
really bad start.

216
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:06,317
It's probably the worst possible
start to any relationship.

217
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:08,312
Won't you stay and have some tea?

218
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:13,304
Oh, no. You're far too busy and I
wouldn't want to push in.

219
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,312
She's a cow at the beginning. You
know, she's so rude.

220
00:12:19,313 --> 00:12:21,322
The whole thing is a complete joke.

221
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:26,313
Matthew Crawley has been thrust into
Lady Mary's life by a maritime disaster.

222
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,313
I thought it was supposed
to be unsinkable.

223
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,311
I can't make myself believe it.

224
00:12:30,312 --> 00:12:32,304
Is it really true?
Afraid so.

225
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:36,323
But all them people freezing to
death in the midnight icy water.

226
00:12:36,324 --> 00:12:40,308
The heir to Downton Abbey has gone
down with the Titanic.

227
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,317
This alters everything.

228
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:45,810
And the entail means Lord
Grantham's title, estate

229
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:49,301
and fortune must go to the
nearest male relation.

230
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:53,321
An entail, yes. Yeah, we all had to
have a bit of a lesson on that.

231
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:56,305
The entail must be smashed.

232
00:12:56,306 --> 00:12:58,304
You can't break it. I'll tell you
that.

233
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:01,313
I've tried. Can't break it.

234
00:13:05,314 --> 00:13:08,311
It's a very strange thing that's
asked of him, I think.

235
00:13:08,312 --> 00:13:10,808
You know, to come into
their midst and be told

236
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,304
that, 'One day, my son,
all this will be yours. '

237
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:16,316
You know, it's very odd.
Welcome to Downton.

238
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:19,304
Thank you. You've been so kind.

239
00:13:19,305 --> 00:13:22,324
It is my duty to make sure that he
comes to terms with that, actually.

240
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,311
They're going to have to make the
best of it.

241
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,305
What should we call each other?

242
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:31,319
Well, we could always start with Mrs
Crawley and Lady Grantham.

243
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,815
Everybody's trying to
throw him curve balls and

244
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:41,319
Mary, in particular, is
very keen to wrong foot him

245
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,319
and prove that he's
not the right man for

246
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,317
the job and that he
shouldn't be there.

247
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:47,814
By the way, if ever you
want to ride, just let

248
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:50,309
Lynch know and he'll
sort it out for you.

249
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,319
Oh, Papa, cousin Matthew doesn't
ride. I ride.

250
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,322
Mary is irritated, frustrated,
angered by her loss of her own,

251
00:13:58,323 --> 00:14:02,317
what she thinks should have been her
inheritance.

252
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:05,813
The vast majority of
aristocratic families,

253
00:14:05,814 --> 00:14:09,308
the women have no rights at all.

254
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,317
If they could make a good marriage, then
they could become very powerful indeed.

255
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:17,313
But if they did not make a good
marriage, they had nothing.

256
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,323
To Lady Mary's family, the solution
to her problem is simple.

257
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:25,313
Marry a man who can
barely hold his knife

258
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:28,302
like a gentleman?
Oh, you exaggerate.

259
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:34,311
When marrying well is your sole
ambition, dressing the part is vital.

260
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:36,318
I'll admit that if I ever
wanted to attract a man,

261
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,323
I'd steer clear of those
clothes and that hat.

262
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:43,313
Day to day life for the girls really
would have meant a lot of changing.

263
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:48,302
They would always change for dinner,
even if it's just the five of them,

264
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,302
they'll be wearing
their pearls, their

265
00:14:50,303 --> 00:14:52,300
diamonds and their long,
beautiful dresses.

266
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:54,319
So, I don't know how they got much
else done.

267
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,317
It takes quite a while to put on
those dresses.

268
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,302
Behind the scenes, a team of six
works full-time

269
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:07,319
to recreate the elaborate fashions
down to the tiniest period detail.

270
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,307
This dress for Lady Mary Crawley.

271
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:13,805
It's a piece of vintage
beading but then it was sort

272
00:15:13,806 --> 00:15:17,302
of reimagined with a new
back and new trimmings.

273
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:22,302
I did this dress for Michelle as well,
which is slightly later period.

274
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:25,314
It was inspired by a very early
Chanel from 1919.

275
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:32,309
You look very nice.
Thank you, darling.

276
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,320
While the men are stuck in the same
old white tie night after night,

277
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:39,302
the ladies' beautiful look
comes at a price.

278
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,308
I sometimes have personal run-ins
with my corset.

279
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:46,301
I'm not a big fan of them.

280
00:15:46,302 --> 00:15:48,310
And we've all got corsets
on like they have.

281
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,323
The corsets can get a bit
cheeky after 12 hours.

282
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:54,309
Below stairs they get
all the discomfort of

283
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,303
Edwardian dress with
none of the glamour.

284
00:15:57,304 --> 00:16:00,309
Downstairs girls, we get really bad
costume envy.

285
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,321
If suddenly
an upstairs character is around,

286
00:16:02,322 --> 00:16:06,312
that's when you start to feel like,
'Oh, my God, I'm so depressed. '

287
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,320
When Lady Crawley comes down, I was
so confused.

288
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,318
I called her Your Majesty by mistake
three times in the scene.

289
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:14,315
Your Ladyship, I
went, 'Your Majesty.

290
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:16,310
' Cos I felt like I was
talking to the Queen.

291
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:20,302
There was no sort of real rapport with
her because she was so different.

292
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:27,314
Upstairs the finest clothes come out
for visiting dignitaries.

293
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:30,318
But not every guest is an exciting
prospect.

294
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,317
A Mr... Kemal Pamuk.

295
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,820
I can see him now, a funny
little foreigner with

296
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:38,321
a wide, toothy grin and
hair reeking of pomade.

297
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:42,304
I wouldn't quite say that. Here he
is now.

298
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,303
Lady Mary Crawley, I presume?

299
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:48,319
You presume right.

300
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,815
Sorry to be so dishevelled.
We've been on a train

301
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:53,309
since dawn and we had
to change in a shake.

302
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,317
You don't look dishevelled to me.

303
00:16:55,318 --> 00:17:00,320
She's often very hard with men and
quite cold and steely

304
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:06,320
and actually with Pamuk she just
melted and was swept away by him.

305
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:09,307
You know, she sort of embarrasses
herself quite a lot.

306
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:16,312
What is it? Is this picture really a
della Francesca?

307
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:21,311
I think so. The second Earl brought
back several paintings from...

308
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,319
Mr Pamuk.

309
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,305
The man from Turkey is not
constrained

310
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:31,312
by the social mores of the time that
poor old Mary was

311
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:34,300
and when Mr Pamuk
walks into that room,

312
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:36,301
he's decided he's going to have her.

313
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:41,324
She's not as sophisticated as a young
woman of her age would be today.

314
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,318
She probably doesn't know much about
the facts of life.

315
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,316
You and my parents have something in
common. Oh?

316
00:17:48,324 --> 00:17:52,318
You believe I'm much more of a rebel
than I am.

317
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,324
Now please go.

318
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,814
It's in an era when there
are huge ramifications

319
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:01,313
for such a thing
being discovered.

320
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:07,316
Unfortunately in a way that only
Julian can dream up, she is caught

321
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:11,300
and I don't need to tell you how.

322
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,301
I think he's dead.

323
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:15,305
No, I'm sure he's dead.

324
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,307
The Turk is a true story.

325
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:20,306
It's always rather interesting
that what seems the

326
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,304
most fictional is in fact
based entirely in truth.

327
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:26,306
A great friend of ours who
is an owner of a great

328
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:29,306
house came upon a diary
of one of his great aunts

329
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:31,319
and this whole incident is recorded.

330
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,302
Now we must decide what to do for
the best.

331
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:37,314
There's only one thing we can do.

332
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:40,323
It's just this dark secret between
the two floors, you know,

333
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:43,319
I think that's what is so brilliant
about Downton.

334
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,322
It's when the characters come together
that makes it so interesting.

335
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:53,304
We did all the scenes where we were
carrying Mr Pamuk through the house

336
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:56,310
and it was a mixture of
it being kind of fun

337
00:18:56,311 --> 00:18:59,314
but also really, really
shocking as well.

338
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,815
Something happened to Mary.
She made this

339
00:19:03,816 --> 00:19:07,311
huge mistake and now
she's damaged goods.

340
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,311
I can't make his eyes stay shut.

341
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:15,318
It certainly made her more human and
much more vulnerable as a person.

342
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,820
Of course it would
happen to a foreigner.

343
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:20,321
It's typical.
Don't be ridiculous.

344
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:24,313
I'm not being ridiculous.
No Englishman would

345
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:27,302
dream of dying in
someone else's house.

346
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:29,313
Especially someone they didn't even
know.

347
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:36,309
But Mary's scandalous story doesn't
stay secret for long,

348
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,307
thanks to the unsisterly behaviour of
Lady Edith Crawley.

349
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:47,305
We have three grown-up, very rich girls
who are bored out of their skull.

350
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:54,308
All their energy is turned into this
sibling rivalry and fighting

351
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,303
and bitterness and jealousy.

352
00:19:56,304 --> 00:20:00,313
Spare me your boasting, please.
Now who's jealous?

353
00:20:00,314 --> 00:20:05,308
I told my family. I said this part,
this sister, she's not very nice.

354
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,312
She's a bit of a bitch,
Edith, and after the

355
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:09,315
first three episodes or
so, my mum said to me,

356
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:13,311
'I don't know what you're talking about,
she's lovely, she's misunderstood. '

357
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,310
And by the end she
was like, 'No, yeah,

358
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,308
you're right, she's
awful, she's a bitch. '

359
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,316
Is it true you wrote to the Turkish
ambassador about Kamal?

360
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:23,303
Yeah, she behaves quite badly.

361
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:27,313
And what if I did? He had a right to
know how his countryman died...

362
00:20:27,314 --> 00:20:29,324
in the arms of a slut.

363
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,322
She is not so good-looking.

364
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:37,319
She is not so charismatic as her
elder sister.

365
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
So, all of these men that are thrown
at Mary,

366
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:43,306
I think Edith is very jealous and
desperate for an offer to come her way.

367
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:46,317
So, he slipped the hook.

368
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:50,314
At least I'm not fishing with no
bait.

369
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:54,320
Yes, the sisters are really wicked
with each other.

370
00:20:56,304 --> 00:20:58,814
So, Matthew goes from being
flavour of the month

371
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,324
to suddenly being another
pawn in a game again

372
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,303
which is incredibly frustrating for
him, I think.

373
00:21:05,304 --> 00:21:07,319
You know, I don't dislike him as
much as you do.

374
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,323
Perhaps you don't dislike him at
all.

375
00:21:09,324 --> 00:21:15,306
She thinks, 'If Mary doesn't want him,
then I'll have a go, ' without any hope.

376
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:19,304
Lady Edith's plan of
seduction starts by tempting

377
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:22,306
Matthew with an architectural
tour of local churches.

378
00:21:22,307 --> 00:21:25,324
Edith doesn't really have any
interest in these churches,

379
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,319
she's just interested in spending
time with cousin Matthew.

380
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,303
I wish we could talk a little more
about you.

381
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:35,301
What was it like growing up in
Manchester?

382
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:37,317
Does it say anything about the side
aisles?

383
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:40,317
Just gazing lovingly at
the back of Matthew's

384
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:43,315
head and Matthew
completely unaware.

385
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,305
I wonder how Mary's getting on.
All right, I should think.

386
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:50,315
Why? I just wondered.

387
00:21:51,314 --> 00:21:55,318
I remember the first series, there
was sort of a catchphrase on set

388
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:58,314
of 'poor Edith' after the end of
every scene.

389
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:01,318
We've time for one more at least
before we lose the light.

390
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,310
I underestimated your enthusiasm.

391
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:10,817
Lady Mary can't help
but notice that cousin

392
00:22:10,818 --> 00:22:13,320
Matthew's a hit with both
her younger sisters.

393
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:15,321
You must be careful not
to break Sybil's heart.

394
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,321
I think she has a crush on you.

395
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:22,322
Well, that's something no-one could
accuse you of. Oh, I don't know.

396
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:30,310
I assume you speak in the spirit of
mockery? You should have more faith.

397
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,812
It's quite a bold move, in
those times, to be left

398
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:35,313
alone, having sandwiches
over a dining table.

399
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:38,323
It's much more racy than it sounds
these days

400
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:41,315
but it's a nice scene to
play because suddenly

401
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:44,305
all the electricity that's
been sparking around

402
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,804
and building up over the
course of the series,

403
00:22:46,805 --> 00:22:49,301
you were allowed to
light the light bulb.

404
00:23:00,303 --> 00:23:02,303
He proposed to me.

405
00:23:03,306 --> 00:23:04,311
Oh, my dear.

406
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,316
Have you given him an answer?

407
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:11,310
Only that I'd think about it.

408
00:23:11,318 --> 00:23:14,300
Always Mary has to think about it.

409
00:23:14,301 --> 00:23:17,305
She's impulsive in some
ways but when it comes to

410
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:20,309
making a decision, she
finds it really difficult.

411
00:23:21,323 --> 00:23:25,322
Pregnant?
You needn't be quite soshocked.

412
00:23:25,323 --> 00:23:28,323
Cora's happy news does nothing to
help.

413
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,304
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

414
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:34,301
and I go back to living on my wits
and you'd rather not follow me.

415
00:23:34,302 --> 00:23:37,313
Oh, Matthew, you always make
everything so black and white.

416
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,313
I think this is black and white.

417
00:23:39,314 --> 00:23:42,302
Do you love me enough to spend your
life with me?

418
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:46,317
It's the moment that she realises
that it's not going to happen,

419
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:49,318
I think that is the point
where Mary realises

420
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,317
that she does in fact
really love him.

421
00:23:54,303 --> 00:23:56,301
So I've ruined everything.

422
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:02,308
But in 1914, this whole
world of elegance

423
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,309
is turned upside
down for everyone.

424
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,310
Action!

425
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:13,304
It beats sitting round a dining
table for three days, I tell you.

426
00:24:13,305 --> 00:24:15,318
Even the great class divide is under
threat.

427
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,315
When are they going to kiss?
Come on!

428
00:24:17,316 --> 00:24:20,308
Are they ever going to kiss?
They finally kiss.

429
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:28,107
The First World War
transformed life in

430
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:31,109
Britain and Downton
Abbey is no exception.

431
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,107
I like that whole half century

432
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:39,105
between 1890 and 1940

433
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:43,115
because it's only 50 years, you
know, within many lifetimes,

434
00:24:43,116 --> 00:24:48,119
and yet it really was the transition
of the old world into the new.

435
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,114
The trades union movement was
beginning,

436
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:55,110
Karl Marx's writings were having an
influence across the world.

437
00:24:55,112 --> 00:25:01,102
Women's rights and, of course, it
took a war to release all this stuff.

438
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:05,122
Sergeant Stevens. Sir?

439
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:09,122
I want every wounded man taken down the
line before it starts to get dark.

440
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:12,116
We've bloody well lost enough of
them for one day.

441
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:14,618
Having volunteered to go
to the front, Matthew

442
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,118
is caught up in the
Battle of the Somme,

443
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:22,107
which claimed the lives of nearly 20,000
men on the first day of fighting alone.

444
00:25:22,108 --> 00:25:23,124
Forward!

445
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,116
The trenches stuff, it was such a
joy because, you know,

446
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,621
guys like me don't
always get asked to do,

447
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:32,124
sort of, heroic action
stuff, you know.

448
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:36,109
There will be explosions
on this take.

449
00:25:37,114 --> 00:25:39,610
Let's make our hero heroic,
for goodness' sake.

450
00:25:39,611 --> 00:25:42,106
Well, he's certainly going
to come across as that.

451
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,101
Give him something jolly brave to
do.

452
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,102
And action!

453
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,110
This is my wounded soldier.
Stuntman.

454
00:25:56,111 --> 00:26:00,102
Yeah. I asked for the smallest,
lightest man they could find.

455
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,101
I've had no breakfast!

456
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,106
On location in Suffolk,
50 supporting artists

457
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:13,102
help bring to life this
bloodiest of all battles.

458
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:15,103
Whoo!

459
00:26:15,104 --> 00:26:18,114
It's a world away from the splendour
of Downton Abbey.

460
00:26:20,103 --> 00:26:22,123
I still think Maggie Smith should be
in this scene.

461
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,117
Lobbing mint imperials over the top!

462
00:26:25,118 --> 00:26:27,118
And, action!

463
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:32,120
With the explosions and everything,
it does get your adrenalin going.

464
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,606
Like there. You know,
differently timed explosions

465
00:26:35,607 --> 00:26:38,109
we hadn't rehearsed so
we were just playing it

466
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,112
as and when the crap falls on your
head, which is amazing.

467
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:46,122
Yeah, it beats sitting around a dining
table for three days, I tell you.

468
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,119
And the war makes its mark on
Downton Abbey.

469
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,112
Many of Britain's great
houses played a vital

470
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,103
role in nursing injured
soldiers back to health.

471
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,119
Highclere which is, you
know, the real Downton, was

472
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,119
not a convalescent home as
we have it but a hospital.

473
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,102
A rather extraordinary character
called Almina, Countess of Caernarfon,

474
00:27:09,103 --> 00:27:11,108
got her father to fund a real
hospital.

475
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:13,100
Oh, really.

476
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:15,757
It's like living in a
second-rate hotel where the

477
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:18,413
guests keep arriving and
no-one seems to leave.

478
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:24,115
I think the war sort of broke that
vision that Edwardian England had

479
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:27,107
of itself as this sort of flawless
place

480
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:31,115
where everyone knew who they were
and what they should be doing.

481
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,108
Come on, damn you.

482
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,121
I think that was over.

483
00:27:35,122 --> 00:27:38,116
While adjusting to the new order is
difficult for some,

484
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:41,113
for others, it offers a glimpse of
the future.

485
00:27:41,114 --> 00:27:45,102
Interestingly the daughters rise to
the challenge first.

486
00:27:45,116 --> 00:27:48,120
They find some useful purpose.

487
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:51,112
As soon as I've done this, I'll take
your orders for books.

488
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:55,102
She grows up and understands the
world in a different way

489
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:57,121
and I think that she can be helpful
and practical

490
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:59,622
and carve a role for
herself in the world

491
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:02,122
that doesn't just include
getting married.

492
00:28:02,123 --> 00:28:05,109
I hadn't cast you as Florence
Nightingale.

493
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,115
We can't leave all the moral
high ground to Sybil.

494
00:28:07,116 --> 00:28:09,120
She might get lonely there.

495
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:15,110
She's been in this house in this
sort of little Downton bubble

496
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:18,115
but being the kind of girl that she
is, she needs to do something.

497
00:28:18,116 --> 00:28:20,111
She can no longer just sit there.

498
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:25,115
By joining the ranks of World War I's
9,000 volunteer nurses,

499
00:28:25,116 --> 00:28:29,113
Lady Sybil sees the world outside the
walls of Downton

500
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:33,118
and her taste of freedom has
far-reaching consequences.

501
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,105
We are talking about...
Branson, yes.

502
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:39,108
The chauffeur? Branson? What has he
said to you?

503
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:43,123
That he loves me and he wants me to
run away with him. Good God in heaven.

504
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:46,117
He falls head over heels in love and
then spends a long time

505
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:49,110
trying to convince her that she
should do the same for him!

506
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:52,106
I'll stay in Downton until you want
to run away with me.

507
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,115
Don't be ridiculous.

508
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:58,121
She really has to consider losing
her family, her friends,

509
00:28:58,122 --> 00:29:02,120
her security, her life, everything
she's grown up with.

510
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:07,611
In the close confines of a
house like Downton Abbey,

511
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:11,104
it's not easy to pursue love
across the class divide.

512
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:14,542
She's sort of constantly kind of,
you know, popping into garage.

513
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:20,118
I wish I knew how an engine worked.
I can teach you if you'd like.

514
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,115
You know in that way when
you like someone and

515
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:26,118
you just want to sort
of, you know, hang out.

516
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:30,109
Myself and Jess were joking, we're
back here again.

517
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,108
It's three years later and I'm still
tinkering with this car.

518
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:37,109
And, you know, we spent a long time
in the garage of Downton.

519
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,107
Oh, don't badger me, please.

520
00:29:42,103 --> 00:29:43,613
It is slow burning.
The whole way through

521
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:45,122
I was constantly
reading scripts going,

522
00:29:45,123 --> 00:29:48,104
'When are they going to kiss? Will
they ever kiss?

523
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,115
I have to say I think Branson's very
patient.

524
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:58,103
I wonder how many other people would
wait for that long.

525
00:29:58,104 --> 00:30:02,103
You get that sense every time she goes
back to the garage, people are like,

526
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:04,104
'If you don't kiss, I'll
throw something at the TV.

527
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:06,103
' It's like, 'Come on!'

528
00:30:06,124 --> 00:30:09,102
Yes, you can kiss me.

529
00:30:09,103 --> 00:30:11,105
They finally kiss.

530
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:18,100
And at last, Lady Sybil and Branson
escape the garage.

531
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:22,107
Oh, my God. She's eloped. She's on
her way to Gretna Green.

532
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:25,103
They keep leaving notes. This is the
problem.

533
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:29,114
If they didn't leave notes, they would
have been away, married and everything.

534
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:32,101
You don't expect a car chase in
Downton.

535
00:30:32,102 --> 00:30:35,100
I suppose we do have one.

536
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,103
Everyone keep an eye out for the
motor.

537
00:30:37,122 --> 00:30:42,121
Mary and Edith get in a car together
and run and save their sister.

538
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:47,111
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

539
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,106
How did you find us? How did you
know?

540
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:53,113
But these two fear no-one...

541
00:30:54,123 --> 00:30:56,119
not even Lord Grantham.

542
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:01,109
Yes? He bursts straight into them after
dinner, which is completely unheard of.

543
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,113
Number one, he's a chauffeur, he
shouldn't even be in the house.

544
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:06,117
You've asked me to come
and I've come.

545
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:10,124
Would someone please tell me what is
going on?

546
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,109
Or have we all stepped through the
looking glass?

547
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,116
In the scene, everyone's
so shocked kind of going,

548
00:31:15,117 --> 00:31:17,121
'When did this happen?
How did this happen?'

549
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:21,104
I won't allow it. I will not allow
my daughter to throw away her life.

550
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:24,105
You can posture it all you like,
Papa, it won't make any difference.

551
00:31:24,106 --> 00:31:25,121
Oh, yes it will. How?

552
00:31:25,122 --> 00:31:29,104
I don't want any money. You can
hardly lock me up until I die.

553
00:31:29,105 --> 00:31:31,106
That's brave, I think, for the time.

554
00:31:31,107 --> 00:31:33,115
I think that's a pretty brave thing
to do.

555
00:31:33,116 --> 00:31:35,107
Tom.

556
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:38,124
Downton's ordered world appears to be
crumbling.

557
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,104
At least there's one couple doing
things properly.

558
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:50,110
Mr Bates, is this a proposal?

559
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:53,122
If that's what you want to call it.

560
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:58,100
And you might start calling me John.

561
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:03,110
Everything is rosy in the garden
until the arrival of his first wife.

562
00:32:07,105 --> 00:32:09,119
As an actress I was really pleased
that it all went wrong

563
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,119
cos I thought I don't want
it to just be happily

564
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,117
ever after cos otherwise
I'll be bored.

565
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:15,120
You see, if you don't
come back to me, I'm

566
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:17,121
going to the newspapers
with a cracking story

567
00:32:17,122 --> 00:32:20,114
and I'd like to bet the Grantham's
won't survive it. Oh?

568
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:24,107
A diplomat dying in the bed of an
earl's unmarried daughter?

569
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,109
Well, that takes the ticket for the
tale of the year.

570
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:30,108
It's bad enough that
he won't come back,

571
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:33,106
that's bad enough but
that's liveable with.

572
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:35,613
The idea that he won't
come back cos he's going

573
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:38,118
to be happy with someone
else, is intolerable.

574
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:43,108
Vera's interference...
You bitch.

575
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,121
Is enough to push Bates to the
limit.

576
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:49,100
Your Lordship, I need to go to
London tomorrow.

577
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:52,117
Please say this concerns property
and not the former Mrs Bates.

578
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:58,120
I only wish she was the former, my
Lord, or, better still, the late.

579
00:32:58,121 --> 00:33:00,120
Yeah, it does get
worse and worse.

580
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:02,119
You know, it does get worse
and worse for Bates.

581
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,121
It's erm... He has a pretty rum time
of it.

582
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:10,117
But could Bates have been driven to
murder?

583
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:12,118
His wife's dead.

584
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:19,121
In the shadow of Vera's death,
Bates and Anna finally marry.

585
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:30,116
The scene this afternoon is their
wedding night.

586
00:33:30,117 --> 00:33:33,103
They finally get married.

587
00:33:33,104 --> 00:33:35,110
Which has been a long time coming.

588
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:38,101
It's the couple's most intimate
scene yet.

589
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:40,107
It's a costume drama with no
costumes on.

590
00:33:45,118 --> 00:33:47,610
The setting for their
wedding night is a

591
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:50,101
bedroom built on a
sound stage at Ealing.

592
00:33:50,102 --> 00:33:52,102
Shall I do that?

593
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:56,106
For Anna and Bates, it's a snatched
moment of happiness.

594
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:58,123
Action.

595
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:09,104
Well...

596
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,103
Mrs Bates.

597
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,610
While everyone tries
to carry on as normal,

598
00:34:19,611 --> 00:34:23,119
in Downton Abbey tragedy
is never far away.

599
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,124
My legs, I can't seem to move them.

600
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,103
BUT... miraculously...

601
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:29,104
Look out!

602
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:32,113
My God.

603
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:42,616
For the characters who inhabit
Downton Abbey's upstairs world,

604
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:46,612
the Great War accelerates the pace of
life and love.

605
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:50,614
I think it did make you realise how
short life could be.

606
00:34:51,624 --> 00:34:54,607
Action. Lavinia and I will get
married.

607
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:56,614
Oh, my dear fellow.

608
00:34:56,615 --> 00:34:59,621
And, as a lot of people did,
got engaged just like that.

609
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:03,621
I think she seems rather sweet.

610
00:35:03,622 --> 00:35:06,622
Meeting us all together must be very
intimidating.

611
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,615
I do hope so.

612
00:35:09,616 --> 00:35:12,614
It was the first scene that
I did with pretty much

613
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:15,611
the entire upstairs cast
there looking at you.

614
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:18,111
It was very easy to access
those nerves and jitters

615
00:35:18,112 --> 00:35:20,610
and everything because
they were kind of real.

616
00:35:21,611 --> 00:35:25,109
But the elegant Lady Mary
keeps her composure in any

617
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,607
social situation, whatever
her personal feelings.

618
00:35:28,618 --> 00:35:32,622
Hello, Miss Swire, I'm Mary Crawley.
Of course you are.

619
00:35:32,623 --> 00:35:35,621
She realises very quickly that she
has to move on.

620
00:35:35,622 --> 00:35:38,619
I mean, she's in her late
20s by the second series

621
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,616
and that's considered
kind of on the shelf.

622
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:47,110
You know, I love that,
that immediately she

623
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:49,614
invites Richard Carlisle
to meet the family.

624
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:52,619
We're pleased to have you here, Sir
Richard. Lady Grantham. Welcome.

625
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,616
Sir Richard Carlisle is a newspaper
proprietor,

626
00:35:56,617 --> 00:35:59,623
inordinately wealthy, self-made man.

627
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:03,623
They're a wee bit suspicious of him
cos he's sort of new money.

628
00:36:03,624 --> 00:36:07,622
And I think they probably think he's
slightly common.

629
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:11,615
I was asking about Haxby Park. I'm
taking Mary over there tomorrow.

630
00:36:11,616 --> 00:36:14,623
Our Haxby Park? Why? Are the
Russells selling?

631
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,622
I'm not sure how
comfortable it is.

632
00:36:16,623 --> 00:36:18,620
It'll be comfortable when
I'm finished with it.

633
00:36:18,621 --> 00:36:21,114
Central heating, modern
kitchens, bathrooms

634
00:36:21,115 --> 00:36:23,607
with every bedroom,
it's all possible.

635
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:25,612
Sounds more like an hotel.

636
00:36:25,613 --> 00:36:28,622
You do get these very
rich, very powerful,

637
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:32,624
in some cases quite tough
individuals arriving

638
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:39,616
and buying these great estates up and
becoming sort of slightly ersatz toffs.

639
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:43,611
What'll we do about furniture and
pictures and everything?

640
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:45,612
What does anyone do?

641
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:47,622
Buy it, I presume.

642
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:51,621
Your lot buys it,
my lot inherits is.

643
00:36:51,622 --> 00:36:54,609
In lots of ways he should appear a
good catch.

644
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
You see, I want you to marry me.

645
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:03,619
He's quite famous. Her position in
society would be very high.

646
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,614
She would have quite an interesting
life with him socially.

647
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,618
But he's...
You know, there's a toughness,

648
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,621
there's a ruthlessness about him

649
00:37:11,622 --> 00:37:14,616
that is very much part of the
business that he's in.

650
00:37:14,617 --> 00:37:18,605
I want to be a good husband and for
you to be happy

651
00:37:18,606 --> 00:37:21,613
but don't ever cross me, do you
understand?

652
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,884
Never.

653
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
And having a little bit of badness
in you is always quite fun.

654
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:31,623
She's with this person who she's now
going to spend the rest of her life with

655
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,624
and she doesn't love him.

656
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,612
Lady Mary's true love is
back at the front fighting

657
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:41,604
for his country alongside
footman William.

658
00:37:41,605 --> 00:37:44,601
Am I ready?
Only you can answer that, sir.

659
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:47,611
And they are not to be spared.

660
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,121
I had to run out of the
crater and look ahead as if

661
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:56,621
we were going to charge but
then hear the incoming.

662
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:59,613
Shout for him, push him out of the
way...

663
00:38:01,604 --> 00:38:04,610
and then an explosion went off right
in front of our faces.

664
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,109
So, I essentiallysaved his life.

665
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,601
One last act of loyalty to
the members of the house.

666
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:19,607
Unlike William, Matthew
survives but like so many

667
00:38:19,608 --> 00:38:23,602
veterans of the First World
War, he returns a broken man.

668
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:27,612
I've still got this funny thing with
my legs, I can't seem to move them.

669
00:38:27,613 --> 00:38:30,107
You know, to be told
that you may never

670
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:32,601
walk again, you know,
it's not good news.

671
00:38:33,613 --> 00:38:35,601
My God.

672
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,602
Is something wrong, sir?
No, nothing.

673
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:41,604
BUT miraculously...

674
00:38:41,605 --> 00:38:43,619
It's too heavy for you.
No, it's not. Look out!

675
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,620
Heavens, that was a near thing.

676
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,624
My God.

677
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,605
I gather Julian did his medical
research, this has happened

678
00:38:54,606 --> 00:39:00,604
and his ability to walk is recovered
slowly and quite surprisingly.

679
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:03,618
Mary! Girls! Cora! Come at once!

680
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:06,118
And then the celebrations
come in and those were lovely

681
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,616
scenes to play when we're
running down the stairs.

682
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,616
Action.

683
00:39:10,617 --> 00:39:14,612
Cora! Everyone! Everyone, come at
once and see this!

684
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:18,604
And everyone's so excited and joyful
and weeping.

685
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,620
They use a steadicam
shot which is where our

686
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:24,618
cameraman sort of straps a
giant robot to his person

687
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:28,615
and charge down the stairs with
Lavinia, through the library,

688
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:34,600
and come and find me
slightly... surprised, I think.

689
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,620
Is it true? Is it true what Lavinia
says?

690
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:43,623
It's a miracle!

691
00:39:45,622 --> 00:39:48,619
Is it true? Is it true what Lavinia
says?

692
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,603
I can't believe it.
It's so wonderful.

693
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,608
I cannot begin to tell
you what this means.

694
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:01,612
Well, it's pretty
good news for me too.

695
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:04,617
And there's more cause for
celebration upstairs and down.

696
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,616
I am sorry to disturb you but I...

697
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:12,604
I've just heard news from the War Office
and I thought you'd all like to know...

698
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,614
that the war is over.

699
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:19,612
But in Downton Abbey, as
in the rest of post-war

700
00:40:19,613 --> 00:40:22,613
Europe, the euphoria
doesn't last long.

701
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,116
They had just got
to the end of this

702
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:30,612
massive killing fields
of central Europe,

703
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:34,610
they'd finally got home,
'Phew, I made it, '

704
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:40,606
and then as the war ends, Spanish
flu arrives and lays waste to them.

705
00:40:45,606 --> 00:40:47,115
Are you too hot
in that, my lady?

706
00:40:47,116 --> 00:40:48,623
We still have time to change.
No, I'm fine.

707
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:53,600
I thought it was important to fill
Downton with Spanish flu.

708
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:57,605
Molesley too? Good heavens.
Everyone's falling like ninepins.

709
00:40:58,616 --> 00:41:00,616
Lavinia?

710
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,612
Do you know, I'm not at all well
either.

711
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:07,618
It was a vicious disease and
effected the young specifically,

712
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,117
which is what makes it all
the more tragic, especially

713
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:14,614
after World War I when
so many young men died.

714
00:41:14,615 --> 00:41:18,604
And it did hit you hard and fast.

715
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:22,616
Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris,
when cholera broke out?

716
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:26,621
Half the guests were dead before
they left the ballroom.

717
00:41:26,622 --> 00:41:29,607
Thank you, Mama. That's cheered us
up no end.

718
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:31,607
Oh, no.

719
00:41:31,617 --> 00:41:34,621
Spanish flu was the worst
pandemic in history, killing

720
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:37,624
more than 50 million
people across the globe.

721
00:41:38,607 --> 00:41:44,601
And as it wreaks havoc at Downton, Mary
and Matthew find themselves alone.

722
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,113
As much as he loves
Lavinia, as beautiful as

723
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:47,623
she is and as wonderful
as she's been to him,

724
00:41:47,624 --> 00:41:51,603
there's a fire that he can't quite
put out and...

725
00:41:52,617 --> 00:41:54,603
God, Mary.

726
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:56,616
He's a terribly romantically
confused man.

727
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,618
How can you resist, you know, you're
dancing with Lady Mary.

728
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:03,619
There's music playing,
it's, you know...

729
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,620
Hello?

730
00:42:12,606 --> 00:42:13,622
What are you doing up?

731
00:42:13,623 --> 00:42:16,606
She is head over heels in love with
Matthew

732
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:20,602
and to see him completely head over
heels in love with somebody else,

733
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:22,608
is the most devastating thing
imaginable.

734
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:27,605
But Lavinia has much more than a
broken heart to contend with.

735
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,612
How's Lavinia?
All right, I think.

736
00:42:30,613 --> 00:42:32,611
The nature of Spanish flu was that

737
00:42:32,612 --> 00:42:35,616
just as you appeared to look as
though you were recovering,

738
00:42:35,617 --> 00:42:37,616
you were at your most vulnerable.

739
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:42,623
Is it Mama?
That's what's so... It's Lavinia.

740
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:48,606
If you then got the second degree of
Spanish flu and it went into the lungs,

741
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,612
you would die probably quite
quickly.

742
00:42:50,613 --> 00:42:54,614
There was no medicine available, as
there is now, to deal with it.

743
00:42:55,611 --> 00:43:00,601
Can you hear me? It's me.
It's Matthew.

744
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:04,605
I knew it was going to come to this
dramatic end and I loved that, actually,

745
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,609
I was, sort of, quite excited by
that.

746
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:09,611
Now, I'm kind of gutted
because I absolutely

747
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:12,612
loved doing this job,
absolutely loved it.

748
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,600
Be happy...

749
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:18,600
for my sake.

750
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:21,611
And then, of course, she takes it
that she has this broken heart,

751
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:24,602
which then leads to her death which
is so sudden.

752
00:43:28,615 --> 00:43:33,611
We're cursed, you and I, and there's
nothing to be done about it.

753
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:39,616
He is a man in hell and the only thing
that will answer is to punish himself

754
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:45,603
because the one thing that mustn't
be rewarded, in his mind, is sin.

755
00:43:45,604 --> 00:43:49,624
This is the end.
Of course it's the end.

756
00:43:51,616 --> 00:43:54,621
After everything that's happened
above and below stairs,

757
00:43:54,622 --> 00:43:57,613
Downton Abbey is in turmoil.

758
00:43:57,614 --> 00:44:01,623
For the family and their staff,
things can't get much worse.

759
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,604
But who knows what might happen in
the future?

760
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:12,614
The Christmas special might give us
a few more clues.

761
00:44:12,615 --> 00:44:16,605
A happy Christmas to us all.
ALL: Happy Christmas.

762
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:17,616
Don't forget to make a wish.

763
00:44:17,617 --> 00:44:20,618
So, what are the cast hoping
Christmas will bring?

764
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:26,603
I would like Daisy to have a new dress
and a promotion and a new love interest.

765
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,610
I mean, I know I'm a dog's body
but...

766
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:32,613
How can you choose today, of all
days, to complain about your lot?

767
00:44:32,614 --> 00:44:36,622
God, I just... I've no idea. I think
they are truly in love.

768
00:44:36,623 --> 00:44:40,606
You would have to be to make that
kind of leap.

769
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:44,607
Things are going very, very badly in
terms of the future of the girls.

770
00:44:44,608 --> 00:44:47,624
Cora, if there is something and you
know what it is, tell me, please.

771
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,610
Perhaps it's time.

772
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,617
Let's just say I hope things
improve.

773
00:44:51,618 --> 00:44:54,610
Let's all make a wish.
A wish and a prayer.

774
00:44:54,611 --> 00:44:55,620
Is this about Bates, again?

775
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:57,613
I think they'll come good in the
end.

776
00:44:57,614 --> 00:45:01,622
I think they... they kind of... Well,
they don't have to, I suppose,

777
00:45:01,623 --> 00:45:04,615
but I think everyone wants them to
do well.

778
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:08,602
How terrible it is. We mustn't lose
faith. He's been wrongly accused.

779
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:10,617
I'm sure you hope so. We know so.

780
00:45:11,607 --> 00:45:13,604
Now, Thomas.

781
00:45:13,605 --> 00:45:15,615
It would be nice to see
her having some sort of

782
00:45:15,616 --> 00:45:17,624
personal happiness outside
cooking a souffle.

783
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,612
Be nice if she had a gentleman
friend, wouldn't it?

784
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:23,602
Happy new year.
ALL: Happy new year.

785
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,602
Well, Mary and Matthew have just got
to get together.

786
00:45:26,603 --> 00:45:27,617
They're meant to be together.

787
00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:31,615
I deserve to be unhappy, so does
Mary.

788
00:45:31,616 --> 00:45:34,614
But maybe they can't be. I mean,
maybe it's too late.

789
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:36,603
Fingers crossed.

790
00:45:36,604 --> 00:45:39,600
Forgive me if I'm casting a gloom.
Don't be silly.

791
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:40,620
And Lord Grantham would like...

792
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:42,621
Well, that would be telling.

793
00:46:06,618 --> 00:46:08,618

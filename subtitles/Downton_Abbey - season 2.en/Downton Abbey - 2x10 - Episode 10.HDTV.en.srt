3
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:09,699
Come here, you!

4
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,559
Out you get.

5
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,473
Untie these ropes
as quickly as you can.

6
00:00:35,262 --> 00:00:37,262
What do you think, Mary?
Perfect.

7
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:46,013
Daisy! Get downstairs with those now!

8
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,410
I say!

9
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:17,605
Mary! Happy Christmas!
And to you.

10
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,250
Anna, this is for you.

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,512
The usual cloth for a frock,
I'm afraid.

12
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,299
But I hope you like the other thing.

13
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,334
I'm sure I will, m'lady. Thank you.

14
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,017
We all prayed for him
in church this morning.

15
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:47,013
Happy Christmas, Anna.

16
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,772
I can't wait for you to open this.
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

17
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,505
Happy Christmas.

18
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:58,506
What did Her Ladyship say?

19
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,522
She was just being kind.

20
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:02,510
Happy Christmas.

21
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:04,520
I wish I could tell you
not to worry.

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,510
My husband's on trial for his life,
Mrs Hughes. Of course I worry.

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,722
Well, I'm old-fashioned
enough to believe that

24
00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:16,683
if they can't prove him
guilty, then he's not.

25
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:19,711
This is for you.
Thank you, m'lady.

26
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:24,116
The Royal Families Of Europe.

27
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,489
I shall find this very interesting,
my Lord.

28
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,095
Good.

29
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:43,705
I don't want to spoil their fun.

30
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,809
But I couldn't wear a paper hat.

31
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,800
Not with poor Mr Bates locked away.

32
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,801
His Lordship said much the same.

33
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:55,819
Is Mr Bates the one Lady Rosamund
told me about? The murderer.

34
00:02:56,366 --> 00:03:00,366
Mr Bates has most unjustly
been accused of murder.

35
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,820
That is all.

36
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:05,803
All?! I should think that's
quite enough for most people.

37
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
Thank you.
Would you like tea?

38
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:12,318
Why do we have to help ourselves
at luncheon?

39
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:13,819
It's a Downton tradition.

40
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,028
They have their feast at lunchtime
and we have ours in the evening.

41
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,410
Why can't they have their lunch
early and then serve us?

42
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:22,636
Because it's Christmas Day.

43
00:03:23,175 --> 00:03:25,177
It's not how we'll do it at Haxby.

44
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,349
Which I can easily believe.

45
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:31,107
This is ni... This is...
What is it?

46
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,821
What does it look like?

47
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:35,822
Something for getting stones
out of horses' hooves.

48
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,811
It's a nutcracker.
We thought you'd like it.

49
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,804
To crack your nuts.

50
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,168
Who's coming on New Year's Day?

51
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,808
The usual guns. Us three and some
locals. You'll know all of them.

52
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,972
Have you asked Anthony Strallan?

53
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:54,226
I tried. I gave him three dates
but he said no to all of them.

54
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:57,818
Perhaps he's given it up.
But he was so keen before the war.

55
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:00,281
Perhaps he's had enough banging
for one life.

56
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,812
And Rosamund's forced me
to invite Lord Hepworth.

57
00:04:03,813 --> 00:04:05,237
Really?

58
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:08,393
I told him I was coming down here
and he dropped hint after hint!

59
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:11,820
Perhaps he has nowhere to go.
It can be a lonely time of year.

60
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:14,819
Jinks Hepworth lonely?
I find that hard to believe.

61
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,810
Hepworth men don't go in
for loneliness much.

62
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:19,811
How do you know him?

63
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:22,150
I knew his father
in the late Sixties.

64
00:04:22,817 --> 00:04:25,810
Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?

65
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:35,209
Isobel told me you were telephoning
for news of Mr Swire.

66
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,647
How is he?
Not good.

67
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:40,802
I am catching the train
first thing in the morning.

68
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:43,227
I hope I'm in time.
Is it as bad as that?

69
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,126
I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,387
Matthew is going to London tomorrow.
Lavinia's father is ill.

71
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,805
Better warn Robert
if you'll miss the shoot.

72
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:55,806
I'll be back by New Year's Day.

73
00:04:55,807 --> 00:04:57,807
He won't last that long, I'm afraid.

74
00:04:57,808 --> 00:05:01,355
Forgive me if I'm casting a gloom.

75
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,811
Don't be silly. We're all under
the shadow of Bates's trial.

76
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,807
Will any of you have to testify?

77
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,817
Only Papa and some of the servants.

78
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:12,818
But I'm going to support Anna.

79
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,807
Would you like me to come with you?
To explain what's happening.

80
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,808
Or will you do that?

81
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,812
Richard wants to go back to work
the day after the shoot.

82
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,813
Don't you?
Yes, I do.

83
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,312
Now, Thomas.

84
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:35,815
What's this?

85
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,822
It's a board for planchette.
What's that?

86
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:43,807
A game. Well, not quite a game,
more a method of communication.

87
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:45,808
How?
Never mind.

88
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,809
I'll take it if you like.

89
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,801
Sybil's favourite.

90
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,814
A happy Christmas to us all!

91
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:00,811
Happy Christmas!

92
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:03,807
Don't forget to make a wish.
Let's all make a wish.

93
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:06,802
A wish and a prayer.
Is this about Bates again?

94
00:06:06,803 --> 00:06:10,819
My new maid says the servants' hall
is full of it. How terrible it is.

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,817
We mustn't lose faith.
He's been wrongly accused.

96
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,813
I'm sure you hope so.

97
00:06:15,814 --> 00:06:17,814
We know so.

98
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:21,823
How has Mr Murray managed
to have the trial held in York?

99
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,813
I don't know, but thank God he has.

100
00:06:24,814 --> 00:06:27,807
And he's confident?
He seems to be.

101
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,805
Lawyers are always confident
before the verdict.

102
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,823
It's only afterwards
they share their doubts.

103
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:37,153
Is anyone there?

104
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Is anyone there?

105
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:47,800
You must take it seriously,
otherwise they'll be offended.

106
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,599
What is it?
We're talking to the dead.

107
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:54,660
But how? They can't talk back.

108
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:57,677
They can. That's the whole point.

109
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:00,806
Come on, Daisy.
No, I don't think it's right.

110
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,804
If you'll all be quiet,
I'll try again.

111
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,261
Is there anyone there?

112
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:13,512
Yes, someone is there.

113
00:07:17,814 --> 00:07:19,814
What is going on?

114
00:07:20,818 --> 00:07:24,805
We're just playing a game.
An unsuitable game, Miss O'Brien.

115
00:07:24,806 --> 00:07:26,806
Especially on Christmas night.

116
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,807
Please put it away at once.

117
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,808
I'm surprised at you, Daisy.

118
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,800
Are you sure there's nothing in it?
Quite sure, thank you.

119
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,801
Don't you believe in spirits, then?

120
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,508
Well, I don't believe
they play board games.

121
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,532
You're reading.

122
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:50,265
For heavens' sakes, yes,
I'm reading. It's a book title.

123
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:52,382
No talking.
I know, but honestly!

124
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:55,809
Five words.
Fourth word.

125
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,813
Two syllables.
First syllable.

126
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,814
Fighting!
Banging!

127
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,815
Drum!

128
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,816
They'll never get it.
Shake! Mad!

129
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,810
Do you always play charades
on Christmas night?

130
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:09,820
This isn't charades,
this is the game.

131
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,821
Trip!

132
00:08:13,811 --> 00:08:17,806
Do you enjoy these games in which
the player must appear ridiculous?

133
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:21,986
Sir Richard, life is a game in which
the player must appear ridiculous.

134
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,823
Not in my life.

135
00:08:23,824 --> 00:08:26,809
Fall past.

136
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,801
Fell! Wildfell!

137
00:08:29,802 --> 00:08:31,802
The Tenant Of Wildfell Hall!

138
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,805
Isis!

139
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,817
Richard, your turn. Come on.

140
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:39,808
How soon your maxim will be tested.

141
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,495
If Mr Bates should not come back...

142
00:09:05,534 --> 00:09:07,534
I am not replacing Bates.

143
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:13,811
What were you going to say?

144
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:17,814
Only that I know that Thomas
is keen to be promoted.

145
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,812
The trouble is, being dressed and
undressed is an intimate business.

146
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:24,803
We've forgiven Thomas
his early sins, I know.

147
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,804
But I cannot imagine I would ever
quite feel trust.

148
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:30,115
Say no more, my Lord.
I'm sure Mr Bates will

149
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:32,425
be home soon, which
will settle the matter.

150
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,801
We're running out of time now.

151
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,815
Did you make all that?

152
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:42,822
Yes, why?

153
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,805
And you're still
only the kitchen maid?

154
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,806
I don't know what I am.

155
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:50,808
You could be a sous chef at least
in London.

156
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,813
I don't know what a sous jeff is.

157
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,617
Or a cook.
Maybe not in a house like this.

158
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,627
But you wouldn't have to go far down
the ladder before they'd snap you up.

159
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:04,822
Daisy, find Thomas and tell him
the tea's ready to go up.

160
00:10:04,823 --> 00:10:08,815
Then we should get started on the
mixture for the cheese souffles.

161
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,816
Does Daisy cook the souffles too?

162
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:12,817
What's it to you?

163
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,553
What do you mean, you've
invited Anthony Strallan?

164
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:24,555
I thought it was just us.

165
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:29,009
Getting important!
He never used to use a chauffeur.

166
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:33,464
Well, you were so disappointed
that he wouldn't come shooting.

167
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:36,817
Good afternoon, Lady Grantham.

168
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:39,823
Lady Edith!
What a charming surprise.

169
00:10:39,824 --> 00:10:42,819
It's been far too long.
It's so nice to see you.

170
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,312
It's such a relief
to see any of our

171
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,803
friends who've made
it through unscathed.

172
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,813
I'm afraid I haven't quite.

173
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:56,428
I took a bullet in the wrong place.
Seems to have knocked out my right arm.

174
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,813
But not forever surely?

175
00:10:58,814 --> 00:11:02,819
The upshot is, I'm afraid, the wretched
thing is now no use to man or beast.

176
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:06,820
Well, now we know why you didn't
want to come shooting.

177
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,821
Indeed.

178
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:13,820
So how is everyone?
Lady Sybil is married, I hear.

179
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,819
Living in Ireland.

180
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,809
How was the wedding?
Quiet.

181
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,815
It was in Dublin.
They didn't want a big affair.

182
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:23,816
Did you all get over?

183
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,817
Mary and I did. Papa...

184
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,809
No, we were all ill. Isn't it sad?

185
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,816
What's he like?

186
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,817
He's political.

187
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:36,818
As long as he's on the right side!

188
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,806
So does he shoot?

189
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:45,813
I'm... sure he does.
But I don't think pheasants.

190
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:09,606
Mr Murray thinks a reference
from an earl will go in my favour.

191
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,877
I'm not sure such things matter
when it comes to murder.

192
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
I think it will help.

193
00:12:16,801 --> 00:12:18,801
Because you want to think so.

194
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,127
Anna, you must prepare for the worst.

195
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:27,158
I'm not saying it will happen,
but you must prepare for it.

196
00:12:31,226 --> 00:12:33,226
I know it could happen.

197
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:35,805
I do.

198
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:40,820
But the time to face it
is after it has happened.

199
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:42,821
And not before.

200
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:46,034
Grant me that?

201
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,818
Lady Grantham, Lady Rosamund.

202
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,819
Hello, Lord Hepworth. Welcome.

203
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Thank you.

204
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,809
Will your man be coming on
from the station, my Lord?

205
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,801
I haven't got one with me.
Is that a nuisance? I'm so sorry.

206
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:16,819
Not at all, my Lord. Thomas will
take care of you while you're here.

207
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
Splendid.

208
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:20,821
Do come in.
Thank you.

209
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:25,582
This came for you
in the evening post.

210
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,821
It's from Sybil.

211
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:32,629
You must go up and change.

212
00:13:32,818 --> 00:13:35,662
So what do you make
of Rosamund's pal?

213
00:13:36,805 --> 00:13:38,806
He seems agreeable enough.

214
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:41,820
I suspect he's in the profession
of making himself agreeable.

215
00:13:42,816 --> 00:13:45,821
O'Brien says Rosamund's maid
speaks very highly of him.

216
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:47,259
That seems a good reference to me.

217
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,689
What is it?

218
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,517
Sybil's pregnant!

219
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,823
I see.

220
00:13:58,275 --> 00:14:00,275
So that's it, then.

221
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,264
No return. She's crossed the Rubicon.

222
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,816
She crossed it when she married him,
Robert.

223
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:09,821
She says we're not to tell anyone,
not even the girls.

224
00:14:09,822 --> 00:14:12,820
I wondered why she didn't ask
to come for Christmas.

225
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,821
Would you have allowed it?

226
00:14:14,822 --> 00:14:20,811
Well, well. So we're to have
a Fenian grandchild.

227
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:24,008
Cheer up.

228
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:29,266
Come the revolution, it may be useful
to have a contact on the other side.

229
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:36,812
I say.
This is very cosy, isn't it?

230
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:37,821
What is?

231
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,822
To find ourselves next door.

232
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:43,806
I'm not certain it's quite proper
to remark on such things.

233
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,819
You remember my maid, Shore.
Certainly I do.

234
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,816
I hope they've got a jolly party
planned downstairs.

235
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:51,809
Why would they?
It's New year's Eve, of course.

236
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,800
That. I doubt it, my Lord.

237
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,800
But I don't mind, I make my own fun.

238
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:01,808
If that's everything, my Lady, I'll go
down now and see you after midnight.

239
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:03,809
I wish I could say the same.

240
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,270
Only joking.

241
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,124
I wonder if she'll remember me.
She will.

242
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,556
Good evening, Lady Grantham.
I don't suppose you remember me.

243
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:17,609
Of course I do.
How is dear Hatton?

244
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,606
I have such happy memories
of it from the old days.

245
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:22,710
I'm not often there,
not since my mother died.

246
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:25,817
Perhaps it needs a woman's touch.
Don't we all?

247
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,821
How very like
your father you are!

248
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:30,815
It's almost as if he were standing
here before me!

249
00:15:30,816 --> 00:15:32,816
I hope you'll come to tea.

250
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:34,817
Then we can talk about him.

251
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:37,816
I should love it, Lady Grantham.
If they'll release me.

252
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:39,807
They'll release you.

253
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,178
What are those for?

254
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:45,163
We have a glass of wine
at midnight on New Year's Eve.

255
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,822
Very civilised.

256
00:15:46,823 --> 00:15:48,985
In my last place, we
were expected to be

257
00:15:48,986 --> 00:15:51,146
upstairs and serving,
New Year's Eve or not.

258
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,811
Were you not a lady's maid, then?

259
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,375
How long have you been with
Lady Rosamund, Miss Shore?

260
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,370
Two months.

261
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:00,422
I see. Quite a new girl.

262
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:06,214
I can read Mr Carson's hint.
His Lordship doesn't trust me.

263
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:08,301
Because of the stealing, you mean.

264
00:16:08,326 --> 00:16:10,333
So what should I do?
Get him to trust you.

265
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:13,008
That's easy to say. But how?

266
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:15,649
Make him grateful.

267
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,683
Do him a good turn.

268
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,008
Hide something he loves,
and find it and give it back.

269
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,875
Miss O'Brien!

270
00:16:31,463 --> 00:16:34,456
Not long now.
Does everyone have a glass?

271
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,454
Anthony Strallan was at Grannie's
for tea the other day.

272
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,439
So I know why he wouldn't shoot.
He's hurt his arm.

273
00:16:41,489 --> 00:16:43,817
Shame. Well, we shall try again
next year.

274
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:49,817
I am sorry I started that.
Now don't encourage it.

275
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:51,818
She'd spend her life as a nursemaid.

276
00:16:53,808 --> 00:16:54,818
He's got no use.

277
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:58,814
Once again, the servants are
downstairs and we're on our own.

278
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,825
In the whole year, we
fend for ourselves

279
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:03,833
at Christmas lunch and
on New Year's Eve.

280
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,895
It doesn't seem much to me.

281
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:07,956
You haven't had to fight
for what you've got.

282
00:17:08,472 --> 00:17:10,472
Do try to get past that.

283
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:13,557
It makes you sound so angry
all the time.

284
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,055
I hope London wasn't too grim.

285
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,659
I got down there in time,
which is the main thing.

286
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,960
And I was with him when he died.
So he wasn't alone.

287
00:17:24,032 --> 00:17:27,672
I'm so sorry, and so glad.

288
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,808
Here we go.

289
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,272
- Happy new year!
- Happy new year!

290
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,824
Happy new year.

291
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:43,804
Happy new year, Mama.

292
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:47,801
1920! Is it to be believed?!

293
00:17:47,802 --> 00:17:49,802
I feel as old as Methuselah!

294
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,803
But so much prettier.

295
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,345
When I think what the last
ten years has brought,

296
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:57,806
God knows what we're in for now.

297
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,828
He's pushing his luck.

298
00:18:11,939 --> 00:18:12,939
How?

299
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:16,003
He wants me to speak up for him
to Lady Rosamund.

300
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,268
If I were you, I'd keep out of it.

301
00:18:21,822 --> 00:18:24,822
We'll walk to the first drive
then use the wagonette.

302
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:28,801
Splendid. I hope you're going to
stand by me.

303
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:31,812
I thought I'd chum my brother.
Cora's coming after luncheon.

304
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:32,823
The second drive, then.

305
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:35,813
You ladies will have to
distribute your charms

306
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,802
fairly as there are only three of you.
Lady Mary?

307
00:18:38,803 --> 00:18:40,805
Lady Mary will stand by me.
Now just...

308
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:43,811
You said you were going to stand
by me for the first drive.

309
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,812
Did I?

310
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:47,813
Yes, I think I did.

311
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:50,822
And one for you. Splendid.

312
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,221
Why don't you have a loader?
Barnard would have found you one.

313
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:33,817
I'm not very good at it.

314
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:36,810
This or double guns,
and I don't want a witness.

315
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,811
I'm a witness.

316
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,814
Then please don't spread the word
of my incompetence.

317
00:19:42,821 --> 00:19:45,321
I never know which is worse,
the sorrow when you

318
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:47,821
hit the bird or the
shame when you miss it.

319
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,369
Thank you for intervening
back there.

320
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:57,424
Before I said something rude.

321
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:00,618
He does rather beg to be teased.

322
00:20:00,815 --> 00:20:03,815
The awful truth is, he's starting
to get on my nerves.

323
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:08,813
Still, you're not the person
to burden with that.

324
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:11,801
You're still going to marry him
though.

325
00:20:11,802 --> 00:20:14,804
Of course! Why wouldn't I?

326
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:18,625
Ha! I think I might have
got that one.

327
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:24,809
You must promise faithfully to lie
when they ask you how I did.

328
00:20:34,803 --> 00:20:36,803
Daisy, you've got a visitor.

329
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:40,313
I were visiting the grave.

330
00:20:40,314 --> 00:20:42,804
I thought to myself, 'Why
not go and see her now?'

331
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:44,805
Take William's blessing with me.

332
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,804
Why not go and sit for a moment
in the servants' hall?

333
00:20:47,805 --> 00:20:49,807
We're sending out the shooting lunch.

334
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:51,816
As soon as we've finished, Daisy
can bring you a cup of tea.

335
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,823
You won't mind, will
you, Mrs Hughes?

336
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,042
Indeed I will not. This way.

337
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:02,808
He's here now. So I think
I should make things clear.

338
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,814
Don't, Daisy, please. William
wouldn't thank you for it.

339
00:21:05,815 --> 00:21:08,815
He won't thank me for bamboozling
his old dad neither.

340
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:13,023
I know you're going to say no,

341
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:16,069
but I was just passing
and I suddenly thought,

342
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,771
'Why don't we go for a
drive, like we used to?'

343
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:21,809
I don't think I should.

344
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,810
I really can't spare the time.

345
00:21:25,813 --> 00:21:27,813
Would you like a cup of something?

346
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:31,232
All right. Yes, thank you.

347
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,097
That would be nice.

348
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:40,663
Is everyone well?
Quite well.

349
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:44,285
Lady Edith will be joining me
for tea.

350
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,345
Certainly, sir.

351
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:49,824
As a matter of fact, I'm glad I've
got you to myself for a moment.

352
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:54,193
I feel it gives me the chance
to make some things clear.

353
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:57,804
I'm not sure I was that clear
when we met the other day.

354
00:21:57,805 --> 00:21:59,805
It's been worrying me.

355
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:01,819
I don't understand.

356
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,800
You see, I couldn't bear for you
to think that we might...

357
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,270
take up together again.

358
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:10,814
When, of course, we can't.

359
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,806
Because of what Mary said that time?

360
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:15,807
Because you know it wasn't true.

361
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,808
She only said it to spite me.

362
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,809
No, it's not because of that.

363
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,802
And if you say it wasn't true,
I'm sure it wasn't.

364
00:22:22,803 --> 00:22:24,803
You see, the thing is...

365
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,809
I'm far too old for you.

366
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,806
I don't agree.

367
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,807
Of course I am. And now...

368
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:34,459
I'm a cripple. I don't need a wife,
I need a nurse.

369
00:22:35,474 --> 00:22:38,491
And I couldn't do that to someone
as young and as lovely as you.

370
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:42,965
I don't accept a single word
of that speech.

371
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:43,981
Lady Edith...

372
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:47,030
If you think I'm going to give up
on someone who calls me lovely...

373
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,701
I'm afraid you must.

374
00:22:55,723 --> 00:22:57,723
Lovely.

375
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,818
I'd like you to know
the place he grew up.

376
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,824
He always wanted
to work with animals.

377
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:09,284
Horses really.

378
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:12,809
But his mother saw him as a butler.

379
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,810
Lording it over a great house.

380
00:23:15,818 --> 00:23:17,818
He loved you both so much.

381
00:23:20,753 --> 00:23:22,988
I'm only grateful
his mother went first.

382
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,487
She couldn't have borne it.

383
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:27,873
No, but she would have had to face
it, wouldn't she? Like you.

384
00:23:28,704 --> 00:23:30,709
We all have to face the truth,
don't we?

385
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,159
We do, lass. Hard as it may be.

386
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,810
Because I want to tell you
the truth.

387
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:40,197
William and me were
friends for a long time

388
00:23:40,198 --> 00:23:42,693
before we started to
feel something more.

389
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:44,815
That's always the best way,
isn't it?

390
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:47,814
To know that there's friendship
as well as passion.

391
00:23:48,818 --> 00:23:50,818
Yes, but you see, I didn't.

392
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:53,483
I didn't feel the love...

393
00:23:54,453 --> 00:23:56,118
so soon.

394
00:23:56,252 --> 00:24:00,758
So I'm afraid I wasted some of the
time we could have spent together.

395
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,801
No, you didn't, Daisy.

396
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,146
You gave him the thrill
of the chase.

397
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:09,823
He talked of nothing but you from
dawn till the cows came home!

398
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,318
And when he saw you felt the same,

399
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:16,804
well,

400
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:19,815
the pleasure was all the sweeter
the waiting. I promise you.

401
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,733
Good.

402
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:26,808
So when are you going to come
to the farm?

403
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:28,107
I'll let you know.

404
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:30,122
Shall I get you some more hot water?

405
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,820
More lies.

406
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:38,821
Were they?

407
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:45,815
That's the horn.
Where's the damn loader?

408
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,819
Looking for your damn peg,
I imagine.

409
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:53,824
Why were you laughing with Matthew
at the end of the first drive?

410
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,637
I suppose he said something funny.

411
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:58,810
Am I never to be free of him?

412
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:02,735
Of course not. You know
how families like ours work.

413
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:04,817
And he'll be head of it one day.

414
00:25:04,818 --> 00:25:07,811
I might understand if you
let me think for a solitary

415
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:10,803
minute that you preferred
my company to his.

416
00:25:10,804 --> 00:25:13,812
I have tried, Mary. I've done
everything I can to please you.

417
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,811
You mean you bought a large
and rather vulgar house.

418
00:25:16,812 --> 00:25:19,819
Don't talk to me like that!
What have I done to deserve it?!

419
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,820
Is something the matter?

420
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:25,412
Richard's loader
seems to have got lost.

421
00:25:25,476 --> 00:25:28,483
And this is one of the best drives.
He's missing all the fun.

422
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
I see.

423
00:25:32,537 --> 00:25:35,327
Where the bloody hell have you been?
Sorry, sir.

424
00:25:35,421 --> 00:25:37,821
I'm afraid Sir Richard's
rather anxious to begin.

425
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,803
I'd better get back to my post.

426
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:45,812
There you are, sir.

427
00:25:53,062 --> 00:25:58,817
Robert, Matthew is going to York
for Bates's trial.

428
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:02,814
And... Well, I wondered
if I might come as well.

429
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,789
Of course, if you want to.

430
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,019
Cora's told me she's not going.

431
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:11,681
And I feel I just might be useful
as part of the bucking-up brigade.

432
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:13,816
That's kind, thank you.

433
00:26:16,351 --> 00:26:20,347
It's odd, isn't it,
us just chatting away here

434
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:22,624
while that poor man
waits to hear his fate.

435
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,815
Please don't make me feel any worse
than I do already.

436
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,821
Have we time to serve the coffee
or not?

437
00:26:28,822 --> 00:26:30,822
I'm not sure, Mr Carson.

438
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,806
We could have used
one of the maids today.

439
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,807
Maids at a shooting lunch?!

440
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:37,808
Hardly!

441
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,816
Anna's very grateful
you're coming with us.

442
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:42,805
Well, I have to go to London,
but I'll be back.

443
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:44,806
What are you going for?

444
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,807
Reggie Swire's funeral.

445
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:50,440
He wanted his ashes to be buried
in Lavinia's grave.

446
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,414
I'll bring them back.

447
00:26:52,462 --> 00:26:54,462
What does Mr Travis say?

448
00:26:54,816 --> 00:26:56,816
I haven't asked him.

449
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:01,171
I thought I'd do it myself one day.

450
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,619
Let me know when.
I'd like to be there.

451
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,643
If you don't mind.

452
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:11,819
No, I don't mind.

453
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:18,377
This is very nice of you to spare
some time for a poor old woman.

454
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:21,814
Won't they miss you at the tea?

455
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:24,800
I'll regain some novelty value
at dinner.

456
00:27:24,801 --> 00:27:26,821
Very well.

457
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:28,822
What shall we talk about?

458
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:32,014
Hatton?

459
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:34,441
Shall we discuss
why you never go there now?

460
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,953
Or Lougherle?

461
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:40,809
Or what about Hepworth House
in Grosvenor Square?

462
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,815
I spent so many happy evenings there.

463
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,933
With your father in hot pursuit!

464
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,397
I see it's time for some honesty.

465
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:52,823
A change is as good as a rest.

466
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,157
I think you know that Hatton's gone.

467
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,807
So has Lougherle.

468
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:03,156
And Hepworth House
had so many mortgages...

469
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:06,781
I could only sell it at a loss.

470
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:10,000
So my spies tell me.
So you want Rosamund...

471
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,167
Or rather, the fortune of the late
Mr Painswick to come to the rescue.

472
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,367
My feelings for Lady Rosamund
are sincere.

473
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,807
I admire her immensely.

474
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:25,367
I do not doubt it. My only fear
is that you admire her money more.

475
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:28,031
Lady Rosamund is too young
to be alone.

476
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:33,303
You'll concede there are many
varieties of happy marriage.

477
00:28:33,953 --> 00:28:35,813
Maybe.

478
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,709
But they are all based on honesty.

479
00:28:39,373 --> 00:28:44,806
I insist you tell the truth about
your circumstances to Rosamund.

480
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:48,808
After that, it's up to her.

481
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:55,818
Have you thought of a date?

482
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,803
When the men go through,
can I steal you for a moment?

483
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,814
There's something I should tell you.
Something nice, I hope.

484
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:04,818
Not very nice, no. But you can make
the nastiness go away.

485
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,819
Curiouser and curiouser.

486
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,816
I'd like to get married
in the spring or the summer.

487
00:29:09,817 --> 00:29:11,817
I am only asking to set a date.

488
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,818
But what's the hurry?
Hurry?

489
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,812
Glaciers are fast
compared to you on this, Mary.

490
00:29:16,813 --> 00:29:18,813
I warn you.

491
00:29:18,814 --> 00:29:20,814
Even my patience has its limits.

492
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,813
Mary.

493
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:37,814
Can I help?

494
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:40,820
After today, I won't insult you
by asking what you mean.

495
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,824
You don't have to marry him,
you know.

496
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
You don't have to marry anyone.

497
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,868
You'll always have a home here
as long as I'm alive.

498
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:52,394
Didn't the war teach you
never to make promises?

499
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:55,688
Anyway, you're wrong.
I do have to marry him.

500
00:29:55,803 --> 00:29:57,820
Why? Not to prove you've broken
with me surely?

501
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:00,818
We know where we stand.
No need for gestures.

502
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:02,820
If I told you the reason,
you would despise me.

503
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:04,821
And that I couldn't bear.

504
00:30:04,822 --> 00:30:06,822
Mary?

505
00:30:06,823 --> 00:30:09,673
Rosamund wants to play bridge
until the men come through.

506
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:11,382
Of course.

507
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,720
T.

508
00:30:27,213 --> 00:30:29,213
O.

509
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:33,212
O.

510
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,124
F.

511
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,221
A.

512
00:30:43,054 --> 00:30:45,054
T.

513
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,219
It says you're too fat.

514
00:30:49,223 --> 00:30:52,850
My Archie never said that!
You're pushing the thing!

515
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:56,214
Come away, Daisy.
We've got work to do.

516
00:30:56,215 --> 00:31:00,209
I hope it's rewarding work, Mrs Patmore.
Something to challenge our Daisy.

517
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,210
Leave it alone.

518
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:05,202
What did she mean, Miss Shore?

519
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:07,203
Nothing.

520
00:31:10,221 --> 00:31:12,221
Who was telephoning so late?

521
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,201
Murray. He apologised.

522
00:31:16,202 --> 00:31:18,219
He's going to come here
the day before the trial

523
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,890
to talk it all through with
Mrs Hughes, O'Brien and me.

524
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,216
Why have they been chosen and not
the others? What do they know?

525
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,483
Search me. I've told Carson.

526
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:31,213
Will Mr Murray be staying?

527
00:31:31,214 --> 00:31:33,214
No, he wants to get to York.

528
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:36,205
We'll meet him there
the following day.

529
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:38,206
My dear.

530
00:31:38,589 --> 00:31:41,606
I hope you can be strong
if it goes against him.

531
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:43,997
It won't.

532
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:46,210
There was an awkward
moment tonight between

533
00:31:46,211 --> 00:31:48,218
Mary and Carlisle at
the end of dinner.

534
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:50,219
Did you notice it?

535
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm sure Mary has him under control.

536
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,211
Does she?

537
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:59,207
I look at her and all I can see is a
tired woman with a tiresome husband,

538
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,208
not a bride on the brink of heaven.

539
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:04,202
I wish I could understand
why she goes on with it.

540
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:07,211
Do you think there's some element
I might have overlooked?

541
00:32:09,217 --> 00:32:11,217
Yes.

542
00:32:15,214 --> 00:32:19,214
Cora, if there is something and you
know what it is, tell me, please.

543
00:32:21,215 --> 00:32:23,215
Perhaps it's time.

544
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:34,666
I was hoping you'd say I was wrong.

545
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:39,611
You're not wrong. But if I do tell you,
swear not to fly off the handle.

546
00:32:40,816 --> 00:32:42,816
And try not to be too hurt.

547
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:45,888
Now you must tell me because nothing
could be worse than my imaginings.

548
00:32:45,926 --> 00:32:51,294
Very well. Do you recall a Turkish
diplomat who stayed here before the war?

549
00:32:53,202 --> 00:32:55,704
I think I can be relied
on to remember any guest

550
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:58,206
who is found dead in
his bed next morning.

551
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:02,801
Well, that's the thing.

552
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:09,213
I wanted to explain
how it will work.

553
00:33:09,214 --> 00:33:13,203
You'll both have received official
notification through the post.

554
00:33:13,204 --> 00:33:16,211
But why have I been called?
What's it to me? I know nothing.

555
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:18,709
Since you are summoned
as witness for the

556
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,206
prosecution, the police
would obviously disagree.

557
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,706
But I'm there for the
prosecution too when

558
00:33:23,707 --> 00:33:26,205
I have no doubt of Mr
Bates's innocence.

559
00:33:26,206 --> 00:33:28,205
How can that be?

560
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,203
It will be made clear on the day.

561
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:32,212
Where does Anna stand in all this?

562
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:36,216
A wife cannot be compelled to
testify against her husband.

563
00:33:36,217 --> 00:33:38,217
That's a mercy anyway.

564
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:49,203
As far as I could make out,
he was talking to his lawyer.

565
00:33:49,204 --> 00:33:53,207
He seemed to be blaming his wife
for cancelling the divorce.

566
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,204
You heard this yourself?

567
00:33:56,124 --> 00:33:58,124
I wasn't eavesdropping.

568
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,223
He was speaking loudly.

569
00:34:00,224 --> 00:34:02,223
But I don't think you can blame him.

570
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:05,219
Just answer the questions, please,
Miss O'Brien.

571
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,209
When John Bates returned from London
on his final visit to Mrs Bates,

572
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,202
did you notice anything
about his appearance?

573
00:34:14,214 --> 00:34:16,214
He had a scratch on his cheek.

574
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:19,222
But he might have got that...
I believe the maid, Anna Smith,

575
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,245
asked him how the meeting had gone.

576
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,028
Well, she and he were...

577
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:29,210
And how did he answer?

578
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,212
He said it had been worse
than she could possibly imagine.

579
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:44,218
And what did he call her?

580
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,217
I shouldn't have been listening
in the first place.

581
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,218
I had no right to be there.

582
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:51,219
But you were listening, Mrs Hughes.

583
00:34:51,634 --> 00:34:54,636
So please tell us what he
called her when he grew angry.

584
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:02,202
He said she was a... bitch.

585
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:05,495
Did it sound as if he threatened
to strike her?

586
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:09,217
But what people say in an
argument...

587
00:35:09,218 --> 00:35:11,218
Did he threaten to strike her?

588
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:21,991
I'm afraid he did, yes.

589
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:30,294
Every case looks as black as night by
the time the prosecution has finished.

590
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:32,798
We've heard nothing
in Bates's defence yet.

591
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:37,210
I can't believe Mrs Hughes
would say those things.

592
00:35:37,211 --> 00:35:39,218
Miss O'Brien maybe,
but not Mrs Hughes.

593
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,219
It's difficult to lie on oath.
Few of us can manage it.

594
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,209
She looked as if she were in hell.

595
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,222
It does sound worse than I expected.

596
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:51,208
It's a great pity he didn't
speak up about buying the poison.

597
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:53,219
I told him to. I begged him to.

598
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,220
He should have listened.

599
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,579
Then it's down to me
to convince them that

600
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,079
this crime is simply not
in Bates's character.

601
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:04,205
So you have no doubt at all.

602
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:06,206
None whatsoever.

603
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,207
We served in the African war.

604
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,205
And I owe my life to
John Bates, who acted to

605
00:36:11,206 --> 00:36:14,201
protect me without any
care for his own safety.

606
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:19,200
Is this a man who could plot
to kill his wife? Absolutely not.

607
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:24,708
Lord Grantham.

608
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:29,205
Did John Bates ever speak to you
about his wife?

609
00:36:29,206 --> 00:36:31,202
Not that I recall.

610
00:36:31,203 --> 00:36:33,203
Never?

611
00:36:33,204 --> 00:36:35,705
He never once spoke one
word of this wife who'd

612
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:38,206
prevented all his dreams
from coming true?

613
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:44,207
Well... You know, one talks about
this and that.

614
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:48,203
Did he give you the impression he
was losing patience with Mrs Bates?

615
00:36:48,204 --> 00:36:50,825
Around the time she had prevented
the divorce?

616
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:55,213
Were you aware that he was angry
at what had happened?

617
00:36:57,218 --> 00:36:59,218
I suppose so.

618
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:04,217
Did he ask permission to travel to
London to see her that last time?

619
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:06,218
I believe he did.

620
00:37:07,607 --> 00:37:12,612
And did you recommend restraint
in his dealings with his wife?

621
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
I don't think so.

622
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:17,215
You're absolutely sure?

623
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:19,216
Well...

624
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:21,217
Perhaps I may have done.

625
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:24,201
You did, Lord Grantham.

626
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:29,200
Mr Bates has, in his interviews,
stated that you prescribed discretion.

627
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:33,209
His case is that
he followed your advice.

628
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,209
But I wonder why the defence has
chosen not to refer to this.

629
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,210
I can't tell you.

630
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:41,210
No.

631
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:43,714
And was there one statement
of his that prompted

632
00:37:43,715 --> 00:37:46,216
you to advise him to
moderate his behaviour?

633
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:52,200
I can't remember. Not precisely.

634
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,201
Give us an approximate.

635
00:38:00,209 --> 00:38:03,692
I must urge that the witness
gives an answer.

636
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,684
I... said...

637
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:14,201
I hoped his trip to London was to
do with some property he owned.

638
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:17,202
And not to do with
the former Mrs Bates.

639
00:38:17,203 --> 00:38:19,203
And how did he answer?

640
00:38:23,212 --> 00:38:25,212
He said...

641
00:38:32,205 --> 00:38:34,205
Lord Grantham.

642
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:41,213
He said,
'If only she was the former.

643
00:38:41,214 --> 00:38:43,221
Or better still, the late.'

644
00:38:56,216 --> 00:38:58,216
I don't know what to say, ma'am.

645
00:38:58,217 --> 00:39:01,214
They twist your words.

646
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:04,042
You had to answer their questions.

647
00:39:04,215 --> 00:39:07,214
I wish to God I'd never listened.

648
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,208
Well...

649
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,212
I suppose Anna is very bitter.

650
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:17,204
I wonder if you would tell her...
I know you're both praying for her.

651
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:19,447
Mrs Crawley, the jury has returned!

652
00:39:25,403 --> 00:39:27,208
Are you all agreed?

653
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:29,211
We are, My Lord.

654
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,700
The prisoner will stand.

655
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,390
Do you find the prisoner to be
guilty or not guilty as charged?

656
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:49,203
Guilty.

657
00:39:55,204 --> 00:40:01,204
John Bates, you have been found guilty
of the charge of wilful murder.

658
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:05,224
You will be taken from here
to a place of execution.

659
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:09,734
Where you will be hanged
by the neck until you are dead.

660
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,183
And may God have mercy
upon your soul.

661
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:17,210
No! This is wrong! This is
terribly, terribly wrong!

662
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:21,206
Take him down.

663
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:29,219
Anna!

664
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:35,352
Did you know this Bates well?
No, not really.

665
00:40:35,871 --> 00:40:37,871
I saw him once.

666
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:41,869
It was when I went to talk to Matthew
in his bedroom just before dinner.

667
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,870
That sounds rather risque.

668
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:46,865
Alas, I am beyond impropriety.

669
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:48,866
There'll be a stink in the papers.

670
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:52,850
To be honest, I'm surprised
there hasn't been one already.

671
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:55,852
Perhaps Richard had a hand in it.

672
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,869
While we're on the subject
of unsuitable spouses...

673
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,873
Lord Hepworth is not unsuitable,
Mama.

674
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,874
You are unjust.

675
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:06,435
He's hardly the consummation
devoutly to be wished.

676
00:41:07,851 --> 00:41:09,861
Did he tell you what I asked him
to tell you?

677
00:41:09,862 --> 00:41:12,863
I know he has no fortune,
if that's what you mean.

678
00:41:12,864 --> 00:41:17,865
No fortune? He's lucky not to be playing
the violin in Leicester Square.

679
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:19,866
He's fond of me, Mama.

680
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,811
I'm tired of being alone.

681
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,382
And I have money.

682
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,416
He's a fortune-hunter, my dear.

683
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,440
A pleasant one, I admit.

684
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:30,458
But a fortune-hunter.

685
00:41:30,497 --> 00:41:32,856
Still, it's your decision.

686
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,860
So have you made it?
Not quite.

687
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:41,860
I'm going to ask Robert to get him
back for the servants' ball.

688
00:41:41,861 --> 00:41:44,130
Will that happen after today?

689
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:47,185
Well, he can come and stay.

690
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,348
Whether or not we feel like dancing.

691
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,289
Thank you. We don't need anything.

692
00:41:56,746 --> 00:41:58,746
Do sit down, Anna.

693
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,860
You mustn't think
that this is the end.

694
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:09,860
For the judge to pronounce a death
sentence is a matter of routine.

695
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,871
Routine?
He means the judge had no choice.

696
00:42:11,872 --> 00:42:15,860
If a man is found guilty of murder,
he must be sentenced to death.

697
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:19,419
But there are many reasons
for it to be commuted. Many reasons.

698
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,850
Is being innocent one of them?

699
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:24,817
We have to work to change the
sentence to life imprisonment.

700
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:26,863
Life imprisonment!

701
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:30,870
Because it won't demand a retrial
or an overthrow of the Crown's case.

702
00:42:30,871 --> 00:42:34,863
Once we have that, we can begin to
build a challenge to the verdict.

703
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:38,862
Do you understand?

704
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:40,863
Yes, m'lady, I do.

705
00:42:40,864 --> 00:42:42,864
I still can't believe it.

706
00:42:43,926 --> 00:42:45,926
I'm afraid you must.

707
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:49,861
We'll need you to write a letter
to the Home Secretary, Mr Shortt.

708
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:52,872
I'll leave for London at once
and put it into his hand myself.

709
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,873
He's a Liberal, isn't he? Pity.

710
00:42:54,874 --> 00:42:56,874
He's a decent man.

711
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,855
The flaw in their case is
the question of premeditation.

712
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:02,862
Even if Mr Bates had
run to the cellar for

713
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:04,868
the poison and pushed
it into her food,

714
00:43:04,869 --> 00:43:08,853
we can argue strongly
he didn't plan it.

715
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:10,862
He didn't plan it
because he didn't do it.

716
00:43:10,863 --> 00:43:13,873
And we'll stress the circumstantial
nature of the evidence.

717
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,866
There may still be elements
that come to light.

718
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,710
What chance do you think we have?

719
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,681
It's not a good chance, Mrs Bates.

720
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:30,286
But there's still a chance.

721
00:43:34,586 --> 00:43:37,161
When will they be back?
I'm not sure.

722
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:40,380
They took Anna to an inn
to help her catch her breath.

723
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,299
How will we ever face her?

724
00:43:43,363 --> 00:43:45,363
With kindness, I hope.

725
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,395
When will he be hanged?

726
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:52,492
Her Ladyship wondered if you could
give her an account of the day.

727
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:54,509
Of course.

728
00:43:56,142 --> 00:44:00,153
I'd like to say I may have been
called for the prosecution,

729
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:04,095
but I do not believe
in Mr Bates's guilt.

730
00:44:05,855 --> 00:44:08,852
What about you, Miss O'Brien?
You're very quiet.

731
00:44:10,116 --> 00:44:12,116
I'm sorry to have been part of it.

732
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,972
There'll have to be a new valet now,
won't there?

733
00:44:16,411 --> 00:44:20,417
I don't often feel selfless,
but when I listen to you, I do.

734
00:44:23,864 --> 00:44:25,866
His Lordship will be so upset.

735
00:44:25,867 --> 00:44:27,869
We're all upset downstairs, m'lady.

736
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,870
Of course you are.

737
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:34,374
His Lordship and Lady Mary won't
want to change, so we won't either.

738
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:39,115
Please ask Mrs Patmore to serve
dinner 20 minutes after they arrive.

739
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,469
Very good, m'lady.

740
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,470
Mrs Hughes.

741
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,966
This is a time of grief for us.

742
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,919
Of grief and heartbreak.

743
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:58,650
I suppose it's down to me again.

744
00:44:58,651 --> 00:44:59,661
What is?

745
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:01,892
To produce dinner 20
minutes after they arrive

746
00:45:01,893 --> 00:45:04,122
and we don't know if it's
in two or ten hours.

747
00:45:04,154 --> 00:45:06,060
What's got into you all of a sudden?

748
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:07,670
Nothing. I know I'm a dogsbody but...

749
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:13,242
How can you choose today of all
days to complain about your lot?

750
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:15,296
I expect Mr Bates would
rather be wondering

751
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:16,670
how to keep a roast chicken warm

752
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:20,617
than sitting in a lonely cell
facing his maker!

753
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,267
You've been hiding from us.

754
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:32,268
I couldn't do any more chatter.

755
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:35,262
Are the Crawleys still here?
They went ages ago.

756
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:37,263
Mama and Edith have gone up.

757
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,271
I'm so dreadfully,
dreadfully sorry about today.

758
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:46,253
I know you are. How's Anna?

759
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:48,254
I sent her to bed.

760
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:53,538
Can I ask you something?

761
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:55,447
Of course.

762
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,016
Do you stay with Carlisle
because he threatened to

763
00:45:59,017 --> 00:46:01,522
expose the story of Mr
Pamuk dying in your bed?

764
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:10,271
When did you find out?

765
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:13,043
Your mother told me when
I asked why you were

766
00:46:13,044 --> 00:46:15,814
still with Carlisle when
you are so tired of him.

767
00:46:17,175 --> 00:46:19,175
How very disappointed you must be.

768
00:46:20,564 --> 00:46:22,564
Your mama chose her moment well.

769
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,923
And you're not the first Crawley
to make a mistake.

770
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:34,541
To answer your question, it is...

771
00:46:35,267 --> 00:46:38,955
partly true, though not entirely.

772
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:44,783
In Mama's phrase,
I am damaged goods now.

773
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:50,252
Richard is, after all, prepared
to marry me in spite of it.

774
00:46:50,253 --> 00:46:52,253
To give me a position.

775
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:53,775
To give me a life.

776
00:46:53,822 --> 00:46:55,463
And that's worth it?

777
00:46:56,256 --> 00:46:59,259
Even though he already
sets your teeth on edge?

778
00:47:00,336 --> 00:47:02,336
What about Matthew?

779
00:47:02,845 --> 00:47:04,851
How does he view the late Mr Pamuk?

780
00:47:05,258 --> 00:47:07,258
He doesn't know.

781
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,553
So that is not what split you apart.
I thought it might have been.

782
00:47:11,649 --> 00:47:14,838
No, there were other reasons
for that.

783
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:17,622
To do with Lavinia.

784
00:47:19,264 --> 00:47:21,264
I see.

785
00:47:21,265 --> 00:47:23,265
And those reasons are final?

786
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:25,266
They are final for Matthew.

787
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:29,254
So, yes, they are.

788
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:40,266
Here is what I think.

789
00:47:40,267 --> 00:47:42,267
Break with Carlisle.

790
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:46,264
He may publish but we'll be a house
of scandal anyway with Bates's story.

791
00:47:46,265 --> 00:47:50,258
Go to America, stay with your
grandmother until the fuss dies down.

792
00:47:50,259 --> 00:47:52,269
You may find the New World
is to your taste.

793
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,270
He'll keep my secret if I marry him.

794
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,259
Once, I might have thought that
a good thing.

795
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,265
But I've been through a war
and a murder trial since then.

796
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:03,261
To say nothing of your sister's
choice of husband.

797
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:07,267
I don't want my daughter to be married
to a man who threatens her with ruin!

798
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:10,266
I want a good man for you.

799
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:12,267
A brave man.

800
00:48:12,268 --> 00:48:16,263
Find a cowboy in the Middle West and
bring him back to shake us up a bit.

801
00:48:18,474 --> 00:48:20,474
Papa!

802
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,275
Have you got a minute, Mr Carson?

803
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,915
Only a minute. I have to go up
and attend to His Lordship.

804
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:41,371
Well, that's the point. This news
is going to change things, isn't it?

805
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:45,785
I have every hope that Mr Bates's
sentence will be commuted.

806
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,866
His Lordship is doing everything...
I know.

807
00:48:49,484 --> 00:48:51,058
And I hope he's successful.

808
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:53,746
But even if he is, Mr Bates won't be
coming home this weekend, will he?

809
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:55,925
I'm afraid not.

810
00:48:56,847 --> 00:49:01,121
So I... I wondered if you'd given
any more thought to my application.

811
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,715
I'm sorry, but I have spoken
to His Lordship and he

812
00:49:04,716 --> 00:49:07,691
thinks you are more suited
to your present position.

813
00:49:09,257 --> 00:49:11,257
He doesn't trust me, does he?

814
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:13,258
Because of the stealing.

815
00:49:13,571 --> 00:49:15,214
I knew it.

816
00:49:24,927 --> 00:49:26,941
What is it now?!
Nothing.

817
00:49:27,426 --> 00:49:29,426
Well, it's not nothing, is it?!

818
00:49:30,644 --> 00:49:32,644
I just feel taken for granted.

819
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:36,754
Sometimes I think that you don't
notice that I'm human at all.

820
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:38,989
So it's my fault?

821
00:49:39,084 --> 00:49:41,086
You talk to me like
when I first came!

822
00:49:41,259 --> 00:49:44,254
But I know things now.
Things I taught you!

823
00:49:44,255 --> 00:49:46,255
Maybe, but I learned 'em.

824
00:49:46,256 --> 00:49:49,264
And I work well, but you wouldn't
know it, the way I'm treated.

825
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:52,260
It may be wrong to complain
with Mr Bates like he is,

826
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:55,254
but it reminds me that life's short
and I'm wasting mine.

827
00:49:55,255 --> 00:49:58,255
Daisy, you're tired.

828
00:49:58,256 --> 00:50:00,262
Why not get away for a day?

829
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,266
You told Mr Mason
you'd go to the farm.

830
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:06,250
Go, then. Breathe the air.
Have a rest.

831
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:08,268
I couldn't. I don't think William
would like it.

832
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,885
You got my note.

833
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,269
I'm so glad you're here.

834
00:50:41,355 --> 00:50:46,995
I feel somehow we were, all of us, part
of each other's story for a while.

835
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:51,263
And now that story is at an end.

836
00:50:51,264 --> 00:50:53,264
In what way?

837
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,843
Matthew doesn't want to live here.

838
00:50:56,269 --> 00:50:58,269
And I'm moving away soon.

839
00:50:59,379 --> 00:51:01,062
You mean to Haxby?

840
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:05,718
Wherever I go, the time we shared
is over.

841
00:51:06,265 --> 00:51:08,265
And Lavinia was a part of that.

842
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,269
Let's take a moment to remember her.

843
00:51:14,562 --> 00:51:17,257
Our Father, which art in heaven.

844
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:24,893
What on earth's the matter?

845
00:51:37,263 --> 00:51:39,268
She's still in love with you,
you know.

846
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,260
I don't think so.
I'm sorry,

847
00:51:44,261 --> 00:51:46,264
but it's as plain
as the nose on your face.

848
00:51:46,265 --> 00:51:48,273
I thought you didn't like her
for throwing me over.

849
00:51:48,274 --> 00:51:52,264
That's a different conversation.
Mother, it has to be like this.

850
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:53,760
I'm afraid I can't explain why.

851
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,518
At least... I'm not going to.

852
00:51:58,269 --> 00:52:00,037
Something to do with Lavinia?

853
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:02,270
Maybe.

854
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:05,414
Well, you see, I think you're wrong.

855
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:09,016
Lavinia wouldn't have wanted this.

856
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:11,261
She was a sweet girl, a kind girl.

857
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:13,906
She wouldn't have wanted you
to be unhappy.

858
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,922
You don't understand.

859
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:20,262
I deserve to be unhappy.
So does Mary.

860
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:22,820
Nobody your age deserves that.

861
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:26,261
And if you are, and you can do
something about it and don't,

862
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:29,108
well, the war has taught you nothing.

863
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,564
That's your opinion.

864
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:34,635
Yes, it is.

865
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:41,456
But you can't have been false
to him.

866
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:44,454
You were his wife
for only half an hour.

867
00:52:44,455 --> 00:52:46,455
It's difficult to explain, m'lady.

868
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,456
Well, try.

869
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,473
I led him on.

870
00:52:49,973 --> 00:52:54,153
When he was wounded,
I let him think that I loved him.

871
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:56,396
Why?

872
00:52:57,072 --> 00:52:58,886
I thought it'd cheer him up.

873
00:52:58,955 --> 00:53:01,468
Give him something to live for.

874
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,463
And you did all this
when you didn't even like him?

875
00:53:04,464 --> 00:53:06,467
No, I did like him very, very much.

876
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:08,468
Everyone liked our William.

877
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:12,454
So you married him to keep
his spirits up at the end?

878
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:13,690
I suppose I did, yes.

879
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:17,440
Forgive me, but that
doesn't sound unloving to me.

880
00:53:17,467 --> 00:53:20,454
That sounds as if you loved him
a great deal.

881
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:23,158
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mama.
I've been outside.

882
00:53:23,182 --> 00:53:25,368
I was looking for...

883
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:32,464
What was she doing?

884
00:53:32,465 --> 00:53:35,458
Mending the fire and suffering.

885
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:38,451
She shouldn't be here at this hour.
Why isn't Thomas on duty?

886
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:41,462
I don't need you to tell me the
world is falling about our ears.

887
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:43,903
Is there any news on Bates?
Not yet.

888
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:45,989
Murray has a meeting with the
Home Secretary later today.

889
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,990
We should know something then.

890
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,226
I'm surprised there isn't more
in the papers.

891
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:53,247
Earl's valet to swing, and so on.

892
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:56,463
But I've seen hardly anything.
And nothing about you.

893
00:53:56,464 --> 00:53:59,466
I quite agree. I can't enlighten you.
Is that why you're here?

894
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:03,463
Not exactly. I wanted to talk about
Rosamund and Hepworth.

895
00:54:03,464 --> 00:54:05,456
Careful, she might come in.

896
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,457
Then I shall speak quickly.

897
00:54:07,458 --> 00:54:09,458
I want to know one thing.

898
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:16,622
Is a woman of Rosamund's age
entitled to marry a fortune-hunter?

899
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,999
Does she know all the facts?
Yes. Yes, she does.

900
00:54:20,028 --> 00:54:23,456
Then I would say yes. But for God's
sake, let's tie up the money.

901
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:25,457
My thoughts exactly.

902
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:27,859
What is the matter, Robert?

903
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:30,894
Isis has gone missing. I can't think
where she's got to.

904
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:04,452
In you go, Isis.

905
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,453
Good girl.

906
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:20,464
Will you stay on at Downton?

907
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:25,456
If they'll let me.

908
00:55:25,707 --> 00:55:27,192
They'll let you.

909
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:30,452
And you have some money.

910
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,950
Mt Murray thinks you can keep it.

911
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,100
I want you to thank His Lordship
for trying to help me.

912
00:55:41,908 --> 00:55:45,083
Yes, but what he said...
He didn't want to say it.

913
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:47,150
I won't blame him for not lying.

914
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:50,473
Give him my best wishes
for the future.

915
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:53,161
And wish all of them well.

916
00:55:54,419 --> 00:55:57,466
I don't want you to hold it against
Mrs Hughes or Miss O'Brien.

917
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:59,464
If you think I can ever...

918
00:55:59,465 --> 00:56:01,465
Even Miss O'Brien.

919
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:07,192
We've not been friends
but she doesn't want me here.

920
00:56:08,129 --> 00:56:09,638
Please forgive them.

921
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:14,465
I'm not sorry, you know.

922
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:16,919
Not a bit.

923
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:21,351
I would marry you now
if I wasn't already your wife.

924
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:23,802
I would.

925
00:56:25,795 --> 00:56:27,795
God knows I'm not sorry either.

926
00:56:31,007 --> 00:56:32,785
Maybe I should be.

927
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,900
But no man can regret loving
as I have loved you.

928
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,087
No touching!

929
00:56:45,122 --> 00:56:47,650
For God's sake, man.
You know where I am bound.

930
00:56:48,978 --> 00:56:50,978
How dangerous can this be?

931
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:15,248
One kiss to take with me?

932
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:37,459
Still at it?

933
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,461
The secrets of the universe
are boundless.

934
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:43,473
Are they indeed?

935
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:46,457
All right, shove over.

936
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,713
You've changed your tune.
Have I?

937
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:50,737
Perhaps I have.

938
00:57:50,754 --> 00:57:53,411
Now, let's get going.

939
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,615
Who's out there?

940
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,765
Here we go.

941
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:04,819
W.

942
00:58:05,844 --> 00:58:07,382
William.

943
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,200
Is it really you, William?

944
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,256
Yes.

945
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,256
My lord!

946
00:58:15,472 --> 00:58:19,064
My gosh. William, is it you?
What do you want?

947
00:58:22,306 --> 00:58:24,306
Go...

948
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:27,712
To...

949
00:58:30,455 --> 00:58:32,455
Farm...

950
00:58:34,461 --> 00:58:35,705
Make...

951
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,020
Dad...

952
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,461
Happy.
Go to the farm, make Dad happy!

953
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,160
You can't say fairer than that.

954
00:58:46,176 --> 00:58:47,973
Is it usually so specific?

955
00:58:48,724 --> 00:58:49,972
Not usually, no.

956
00:58:50,457 --> 00:58:52,457
Well, that's enough for me.

957
00:58:53,459 --> 00:58:55,459
This stuff is thirsty work!

958
00:58:58,455 --> 00:59:00,455
They're in the drawing room, sir.

959
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:02,471
I'm really only here
to see Lady Mary, Carson.

960
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,457
Is there any chance
of... cooking her out?

961
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,458
Leave it with me, sir.

962
00:59:10,224 --> 00:59:12,594
Matthew, you should have come
earlier.

963
00:59:12,629 --> 00:59:14,125
You could have had dinner.

964
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:16,125
Is something the matter?

965
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:19,220
My dog's gone missing. I was going
to go and look for her.

966
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:22,270
We should organise a search party.
Ask the men servants

967
00:59:22,271 --> 00:59:25,265
to join us.
Then we can apply some real method.

968
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:28,471
Mm.

969
00:59:28,472 --> 00:59:31,462
Isis! Come here, girl! Isis!

970
00:59:31,463 --> 00:59:33,471
Poor Papa. I wonder
if she's been stolen.

971
00:59:33,472 --> 00:59:35,472
What a horrid thought.

972
00:59:44,005 --> 00:59:46,005
Thomas? What's the matter with you?

973
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,934
Nothing.

974
00:59:49,164 --> 00:59:51,075
I'm afraid we'll have to call it
a night!

975
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,768
But remember, there's £10 for anyone
who finds her tomorrow!

976
00:59:56,697 --> 00:59:58,785
For now, thank you all very much.

977
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,465
Poor Papa. It's terrible for you.

978
01:00:01,466 --> 01:00:04,456
She may turn up.
She may be trapped somewhere.

979
01:00:04,457 --> 01:00:06,457
We could still find her.

980
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,962
Get back to the house as
fast as you can and ask Mrs

981
01:00:08,963 --> 01:00:11,466
Patmore to heat up some
soup for the searchers.

982
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:17,242
Thomas?
Yes, Mr Carson.

983
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:21,466
Why were you up at the house
this evening?

984
01:00:21,467 --> 01:00:23,467
Did Papa summon you?

985
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:25,970
As a matter of fact,
I came to see you.

986
01:00:27,464 --> 01:00:31,466
I wanted to find out what you meant when
you said you HAD to marry Carlisle.

987
01:00:31,467 --> 01:00:33,137
And that I'd despise you
if I knew the reason.

988
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:35,167
Yes, you would.

989
01:00:36,457 --> 01:00:39,459
Whatever it is, it cannot be enough
for you to marry him.

990
01:00:39,765 --> 01:00:42,254
That's what Papa said.
So you told him?

991
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:44,814
Yes.
Does he despise you?

992
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:47,800
He's... very disappointed in me.

993
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:52,453
Even so... Please tell me.

994
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:59,158
You'd think the good
lord would have spared

995
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,661
him the loss of his dog
at a time like this.

996
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:03,678
Ours is not to reason why.

997
01:01:04,382 --> 01:01:06,382
When will we hear about Mr Bates?

998
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,581
I don't know how they've kept it
out of the papers.

999
01:01:11,479 --> 01:01:13,346
I suppose that will change...

1000
01:01:13,948 --> 01:01:16,403
if it... goes ahead.

1001
01:01:16,459 --> 01:01:18,459
I can't bear to think of it.

1002
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,460
How will Anna bear it?

1003
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:22,461
As the widow of a murderer.

1004
01:01:22,462 --> 01:01:26,450
She'll have to get used to a degree
of notoriety, I'm afraid.

1005
01:01:26,451 --> 01:01:28,675
And so will we as the house
that shelters her.

1006
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:34,472
Then let me put you out of your
misery right away, Mr Carson.

1007
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:37,621
By handing in my notice.

1008
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,539
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.

1009
01:01:46,465 --> 01:01:49,457
If I stay here,
I keep the story alive.

1010
01:01:50,065 --> 01:01:53,806
If I go away to... Scotland say,
or London,

1011
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:55,542
it will die soon enough.

1012
01:01:56,425 --> 01:01:59,452
I'll just be one more housemaid
lost in the crowd.

1013
01:01:59,453 --> 01:02:01,465
She has a point.

1014
01:02:01,466 --> 01:02:03,466
Not one that I accept.

1015
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,470
I mean it, Mrs Hughes. I do.

1016
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:15,849
Say something, if it's only goodbye.

1017
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:26,761
Did you love him?
You mustn't try to...

1018
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:28,466
If it was love...
How could it be love? I didn't...

1019
01:02:28,467 --> 01:02:31,450
Then why would you?
It was lust, Matthew!

1020
01:02:31,943 --> 01:02:34,945
Or a need for excitement.
Or something in him that I...

1021
01:02:35,465 --> 01:02:37,470
God, what difference
does it make?

1022
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:40,468
I'm Tess of the d'Urbervilles
to your Angel Clare.

1023
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:43,468
I have fallen. I am impure.

1024
01:02:43,469 --> 01:02:47,457
Don't joke. Don't make it little
when I'm trying to understand.

1025
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:50,470
Thank you for that.

1026
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:54,463
But the fact remains
that I am made different by it.

1027
01:02:55,034 --> 01:02:57,034
Things have changed between us.

1028
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:03,799
Even so, you must not marry him.

1029
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,817
So I must brave the storm?
You're strong.

1030
01:03:07,864 --> 01:03:10,867
A storm-braver if ever I saw one.

1031
01:03:11,017 --> 01:03:14,036
I wonder. Sybil's the strong one.

1032
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:17,462
She really doesn't care what people
think, but I'm afraid I do.

1033
01:03:18,971 --> 01:03:22,980
Papa suggested I go to New York to
stay with Grandmama to ride it out.

1034
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:28,230
You can find some unsuspecting
millionaire.

1035
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:31,467
Preferably one who doesn't read
English papers.

1036
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:38,459
Go or stay, you must sack Carlisle.

1037
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:43,721
It isn't worth buying off a month of
scandal with a lifetime of misery.

1038
01:03:45,466 --> 01:03:47,466
When is he due back?
Tomorrow.

1039
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:51,459
He and Aunt Rosamund's beau are
returning for the servants' ball.

1040
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,815
Will that still go ahead?
Not if Bates is...

1041
01:03:57,216 --> 01:03:59,216
Not if the worst happens.

1042
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,678
Papa hasn't faced
that it probably will.

1043
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:09,451
You were wrong about one thing.

1044
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,386
Only one? And what is that, pray?

1045
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:18,461
I never would...

1046
01:04:20,467 --> 01:04:22,467
I never could despise you.

1047
01:04:29,456 --> 01:04:31,473
Why didn't you go and find
the poor thing there and then?!

1048
01:04:31,474 --> 01:04:33,971
How? His Lordship was
in the way and Carson

1049
01:04:33,972 --> 01:04:36,468
sent me back with a
message for Mrs Patmore.

1050
01:04:36,469 --> 01:04:38,471
So you'll leave the wretched animal
all night?

1051
01:04:38,472 --> 01:04:41,469
What reason could I give
if I went and found her now?

1052
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,453
Go first thing, once you're free.

1053
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:46,454
And just pray nothing's happened.

1054
01:04:46,455 --> 01:04:48,455
For your own sake.

1055
01:04:51,392 --> 01:04:53,392
Do you think that was William?

1056
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,456
Who else could it have been?

1057
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:58,459
Who else would have known
you'd been asked to the farm?

1058
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,460
That's true.

1059
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,766
So will you go?

1060
01:05:03,461 --> 01:05:05,461
I feel I should. Don't you?

1061
01:05:05,462 --> 01:05:07,462
I think so.

1062
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,580
Isis!

1063
01:05:48,871 --> 01:05:51,860
Good dog! Isis!

1064
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:55,212
Good girl!

1065
01:06:06,865 --> 01:06:12,669
For God's sake, will you just
bloody come, you stupid dog!

1066
01:06:15,866 --> 01:06:18,869
You shouldn't have gone
to all this trouble. Not for me.

1067
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:24,863
No? Not when you're the nearest thing
to a child of mine left on this earth.

1068
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,340
I don't deserve it.

1069
01:06:27,866 --> 01:06:30,873
Not when I were only married
to William for a few hours.

1070
01:06:30,874 --> 01:06:32,874
You were there. You saw it.

1071
01:06:36,874 --> 01:06:38,874
You may not know this, Daisy,

1072
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:42,458
but William had three brothers.

1073
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:44,170
And a sister.

1074
01:06:44,186 --> 01:06:46,186
What?

1075
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,616
All dead. At birth.

1076
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:50,851
Or not long after.

1077
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:55,021
I think that's one reason
why William married you.

1078
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,856
So that I wouldn't be alone
with all my bairns gone.

1079
01:07:00,857 --> 01:07:03,547
Without you,
I'd have no-one to pray for.

1080
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:06,500
I think William knew that.

1081
01:07:10,481 --> 01:07:12,495
So will you be my daughter?

1082
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:15,584
Let me take you into my heart?

1083
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,669
Make you special.

1084
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:21,857
You'll have parents of your own.
I haven't got any parents.

1085
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:23,858
Not like that.

1086
01:07:23,859 --> 01:07:25,859
I've never been special to anyone.

1087
01:07:26,872 --> 01:07:28,872
Except William.

1088
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:30,873
That's right.

1089
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,077
I were only ever special to William.

1090
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,638
I never thought of it
like that before.

1091
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:41,121
Well... Now you're special to me.

1092
01:07:50,786 --> 01:07:54,797
Isis! Where have you
bloody been?

1093
01:07:55,866 --> 01:07:57,870
What in God's name happened to you?

1094
01:07:57,871 --> 01:08:00,850
I've been looking for the dog.

1095
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,853
A village child found her yesterday.

1096
01:08:02,854 --> 01:08:06,861
Somehow the silly animal got herself
shut into one of the keeper's shelters.

1097
01:08:06,862 --> 01:08:09,869
They took her back and claimed
their reward this morning.

1098
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:11,870
That's good.

1099
01:08:11,871 --> 01:08:14,794
Did you really get yourself
into this mess looking for my dog?

1100
01:08:15,085 --> 01:08:17,085
I know how fond of her you are.

1101
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,860
I'm impressed, Thomas.

1102
01:08:19,861 --> 01:08:22,038
It's good to know
there's some decency in

1103
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:24,215
the world at a time like this.
Thank you.

1104
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,028
That's all right, my Lord. The main
thing is, she's home and healthy.

1105
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,442
Mm.

1106
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:48,872
I could walk to the station.
I walked here after all.

1107
01:08:49,868 --> 01:08:51,868
I want to talk while we go.

1108
01:08:51,869 --> 01:08:55,852
If you're my daughter, you must
allow me to give you advice.

1109
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:58,481
I suppose.

1110
01:08:58,715 --> 01:09:01,288
Well, then.
If you're not content with the way

1111
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:03,861
you're treated, don't
sulk and answer back.

1112
01:09:03,862 --> 01:09:05,862
Tell them.
They wouldn't listen.

1113
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:08,858
You don't know. You haven't given
them the chance.

1114
01:09:08,859 --> 01:09:11,358
Go to Mrs Patmore and
explain to her why you

1115
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,857
think you're worth more
than you're getting.

1116
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,869
Make your case. Put it to her.

1117
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:18,855
But Miss Shore says...
Daisy, do me a favour.

1118
01:09:18,856 --> 01:09:20,854
Stop listening to that Miss Shore.

1119
01:09:38,671 --> 01:09:40,671
Are you here? Nobody told me.

1120
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:44,200
Only just. The train was late. I'll
have to scramble to get changed.

1121
01:09:44,395 --> 01:09:46,864
I'm afraid it may be
a rather gloomy visit.

1122
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:49,067
No news yet for the poor valet,
I'm afraid.

1123
01:09:49,382 --> 01:09:51,382
So the servants' ball
has been cancelled.

1124
01:09:51,476 --> 01:09:54,028
Never mind. I'm very flattered
to be asked back on any terms.

1125
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:56,371
I hope I can read something into it.

1126
01:09:56,372 --> 01:09:58,372
Only my desire not to lose my maid.

1127
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:01,870
Miss Shore wouldn't stop nagging
until you were invited.

1128
01:10:01,871 --> 01:10:03,871
You owe her a tip.

1129
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:06,270
But I mustn't delay you.

1130
01:10:10,427 --> 01:10:12,427
What will you do in America?

1131
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:16,348
What I do here.
Pay calls and go to dinners.

1132
01:10:17,862 --> 01:10:20,859
My grandmother has houses
in New York and Newport.

1133
01:10:21,547 --> 01:10:24,550
It will be dull,
but not uncomfortable.

1134
01:10:26,866 --> 01:10:28,145
M'lady,

1135
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:30,867
I've been thinking.

1136
01:10:31,922 --> 01:10:33,922
If things go badly for us...

1137
01:10:35,697 --> 01:10:37,697
I thought I might come with you.

1138
01:10:38,382 --> 01:10:40,382
You mean you won't leave after all?

1139
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:43,173
I have to leave Downton.

1140
01:10:43,589 --> 01:10:45,589
But I don't have to leave you.

1141
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:48,872
But of course you can come with me.

1142
01:10:49,435 --> 01:10:51,435
You don't need to ask.

1143
01:10:53,381 --> 01:10:55,381
But let's not give up hope yet.

1144
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:58,847
No, m'lady. Let's not do that.

1145
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:06,104
My Lord?

1146
01:11:06,465 --> 01:11:08,469
I was only going to say
that if I do need a new

1147
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,472
valet, I think I'd like
to give Thomas a trial.

1148
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:13,853
Really, my Lord?
I think I've misjudged him.

1149
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:16,869
There's more true kindness in him
that I give him credit for.

1150
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:19,852
Is there?
I think so.

1151
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:22,867
At any rate, let's give him a chance.

1152
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:26,164
Everyone deserves a chance.

1153
01:11:26,368 --> 01:11:28,368
Even Thomas.

1154
01:11:33,862 --> 01:11:35,856
Sir Richard's back.

1155
01:11:35,857 --> 01:11:37,857
I haven't seen him yet.

1156
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:40,861
He and Lord Hepworth only just
arrived in time to change.

1157
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:45,866
Are you ready?

1158
01:11:47,502 --> 01:11:49,502
I think so.

1159
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:52,863
I know what I have to say to him.

1160
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:55,871
It's time.

1161
01:11:57,864 --> 01:12:00,852
I wish you'd take my advice
and fight for her.

1162
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:04,865
But I know you won't.
I don't expect you to understand.

1163
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:06,866
That's good because I can't.

1164
01:12:06,867 --> 01:12:10,857
But please, don't invoke the name
of that sweet dead girl again.

1165
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,867
I've always wanted to see America,
so at least I've got a plan.

1166
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,868
I suppose so.

1167
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:25,817
I still can't be glad
you'll be leaving here.

1168
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:29,515
But it's good news that you
won't be casting off entirely.

1169
01:12:29,861 --> 01:12:31,861
It's only...

1170
01:12:31,862 --> 01:12:33,284
I know.

1171
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:36,869
Just so as you know,

1172
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,859
you're highly valued by all of us.

1173
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:42,761
Both of you. Very highly valued.

1174
01:12:53,365 --> 01:12:56,128
My God, Mary, what more
could I have done?

1175
01:12:56,261 --> 01:13:00,872
Nothing. But you must see we're not
well suited. We'd never be happy.

1176
01:13:00,874 --> 01:13:03,870
You won't be happy by the time
I'm finished, I promise.

1177
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:06,851
I'm grateful...
So you should be!

1178
01:13:07,594 --> 01:13:11,594
I buy your filthy scandal
and keep it safe from prying eyes!

1179
01:13:11,619 --> 01:13:13,975
Why do the papers leave
you alone over Bates?

1180
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:16,331
Why is nothing linked to the
great Earl of Grantham?!

1181
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:19,706
I suppose you stopped it.
Threats, bribes, favours.

1182
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:22,042
Yes, I stopped it.
Papa will be so thankful.

1183
01:13:22,052 --> 01:13:23,776
You don't think it holds now,
do you?

1184
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:26,800
You don't think I'll save you
or him for one more day?

1185
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:29,867
And you wonder why we wouldn't make
each other happy!

1186
01:13:29,868 --> 01:13:31,597
Mary, are you quite all right?

1187
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,869
Here he is.

1188
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:36,862
The man who can smile and smile
and be a villain.

1189
01:13:36,863 --> 01:13:40,252
Is she not to be trusted even
to get rid of me without your help?

1190
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:42,864
I heard shouting.
Lavinia knew it, you know.

1191
01:13:43,863 --> 01:13:45,863
She knew you never loved her.

1192
01:13:45,864 --> 01:13:47,864
Don't you dare.

1193
01:13:48,861 --> 01:13:50,861
She said it once.

1194
01:13:50,862 --> 01:13:52,862
It was late. She was tired.

1195
01:13:52,863 --> 01:13:56,103
You two were locked together
in the corner of the room.

1196
01:13:56,830 --> 01:13:58,844
She said, 'If he could
just admit the truth

1197
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:00,858
then all four of us
might have a chance.'

1198
01:14:00,859 --> 01:14:01,874
You liar!

1199
01:14:02,373 --> 01:14:06,174
I'm not a liar. No, I am many
things, but not that.

1200
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:09,531
She regretted it, of course.
But she said it.

1201
01:14:09,594 --> 01:14:10,854
You bastard!

1202
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:19,285
Stop this at once!

1203
01:14:27,557 --> 01:14:29,438
I presume you will be leaving
in the morning, Sir Richard.

1204
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:31,318
What time shall I
order your car?

1205
01:14:35,139 --> 01:14:37,139
How smooth you are.

1206
01:14:38,493 --> 01:14:41,491
What a model
of manners and elegance.

1207
01:14:41,547 --> 01:14:43,870
I wonder if you'll be
quite so serene when the

1208
01:14:43,871 --> 01:14:46,193
papers are full of your
eldest daughter's exploits.

1209
01:14:46,636 --> 01:14:48,636
I shall do my best.

1210
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:51,051
What on earth's the matter?

1211
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:53,236
I'm leaving in the morning,
Lady Grantham.

1212
01:14:53,425 --> 01:14:55,375
I doubt we'll meet again.

1213
01:14:55,852 --> 01:14:57,852
Do you promise?

1214
01:15:07,864 --> 01:15:09,478
Sorry about the vase.

1215
01:15:09,517 --> 01:15:11,127
Don't be, don't be.

1216
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,048
It was a wedding present
from a frightful aunt.

1217
01:15:14,098 --> 01:15:16,306
I have hated it for half a century!

1218
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:28,659
Wait.

1219
01:15:31,357 --> 01:15:35,354
After last night's exhibition, I
rather hoped to escape unobserved.

1220
01:15:35,674 --> 01:15:37,691
I didn't want you to go
without saying goodbye.

1221
01:15:40,726 --> 01:15:43,006
Well then, goodbye.

1222
01:15:46,353 --> 01:15:48,353
I suppose you feel I've used you.

1223
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,350
And I'm sorry if I have.

1224
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:54,342
I'm sorry about Haxby,
about all of it.

1225
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:59,350
I assume this is a plea
to stay my hand from punishment.

1226
01:16:00,109 --> 01:16:03,121
But I warn you, I'd feel no guilt
in exposing you.

1227
01:16:04,556 --> 01:16:06,556
My job is to sell newspapers.

1228
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:11,530
Papa has suggested I go to New York
to wait it out.

1229
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,101
So I'll be all right.

1230
01:16:14,661 --> 01:16:17,656
I just didn't want our final words
to be angry ones.

1231
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:21,361
I loved you, you know.

1232
01:16:22,642 --> 01:16:24,116
More than you knew.

1233
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:28,212
And much, much more
than you loved me.

1234
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:32,979
Then I hope the next woman you love
deserves you more than I did.

1235
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
Don't worry about Haxby.

1236
01:16:40,952 --> 01:16:42,952
I'll sell it at a profit.

1237
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:45,350
I usually do.

1238
01:17:24,865 --> 01:17:28,852
He's still on at me to press
his case with the mistress.

1239
01:17:28,923 --> 01:17:30,923
He's very tenacious, I must say.

1240
01:17:30,978 --> 01:17:32,978
You know men.

1241
01:17:34,207 --> 01:17:36,207
And I know women too.

1242
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:45,327
My Lord! My Lord!

1243
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:48,945
What in heaven's name?
A telegram, my Lord.

1244
01:17:50,388 --> 01:17:52,001
Open it.

1245
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,372
Thank God, he's been reprieved.

1246
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:01,368
It's life imprisonment
but he's been reprieved.

1247
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:03,369
Go and fetch Anna.

1248
01:18:10,161 --> 01:18:13,158
The Home Secretary finds
that many details

1249
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:16,155
call into question the
case for premeditation.

1250
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:18,671
The point is, he will not hang.

1251
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:21,379
But it's still life imprisonment.

1252
01:18:21,544 --> 01:18:23,544
Don't dwell on that. Not now.

1253
01:18:23,659 --> 01:18:25,389
It's life, not death.

1254
01:18:25,437 --> 01:18:27,437
That's all we need to think about.

1255
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,791
We've a task ahead of us, it's true.

1256
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:31,823
Bates will live and he is innocent.

1257
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,829
In time, we'll prove it
and he will be free.

1258
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:37,408
I must go and see him.

1259
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:38,550
Today. They'll let me, won't they?

1260
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:42,570
I can't believe they won't. I'll
get Pratt to run you into York.

1261
01:18:44,362 --> 01:18:46,362
So that is the news.

1262
01:18:46,363 --> 01:18:48,862
It only remains for me
to add that we WILL be

1263
01:18:48,863 --> 01:18:51,361
holding the servants'
ball tonight after all.

1264
01:18:51,362 --> 01:18:53,362
Tonight? Are you serious?

1265
01:18:53,363 --> 01:18:55,363
Mrs Hughes thinks we can manage it.

1266
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:58,352
I never thought they'd hang
an innocent man.

1267
01:18:58,353 --> 01:19:01,351
He wouldn't have been the first.
It's a relief. It is.

1268
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:03,352
I don't mind saying it.

1269
01:19:03,353 --> 01:19:05,353
But he has to stay in prison?

1270
01:19:05,354 --> 01:19:07,357
Only until they prove
he didn't do it.

1271
01:19:07,358 --> 01:19:10,351
If you don't mind, we can worry
about that later.

1272
01:19:10,586 --> 01:19:13,229
Right now, we have a great deal
of work to do.

1273
01:19:14,718 --> 01:19:16,728
His Lordship means to work
with Mr Murray.

1274
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,713
Will you stay at Downton now?

1275
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:25,009
Of course. I'm sorry to let Lady
Mary down but I think I should.

1276
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:30,229
There maybe some way I can help
them to overturn the conviction.

1277
01:19:30,293 --> 01:19:33,293
I don't know what I can do,
but there may be something.

1278
01:19:33,849 --> 01:19:34,866
I don't deserve you.

1279
01:19:35,107 --> 01:19:37,107
Because we will overturn it.

1280
01:19:38,218 --> 01:19:40,239
I won't rest until we have you out.

1281
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:42,730
But it may take years.

1282
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:44,819
That's if you ever manage it.

1283
01:19:46,088 --> 01:19:48,088
So there's one thing I must ask.

1284
01:19:50,909 --> 01:19:54,910
I can't have you grey-faced
and in perpetual mourning.

1285
01:19:56,366 --> 01:19:58,366
Promise me...

1286
01:20:00,603 --> 01:20:02,603
that you'll make friends.

1287
01:20:03,842 --> 01:20:05,842
Have fun.

1288
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,401
Live life.

1289
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:14,760
I'll try.

1290
01:20:17,002 --> 01:20:18,357
I promise.

1291
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:26,530
Can I give you some whisky to
fortify you for the coming ordeal?

1292
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:31,203
That's very kind. Is there anyone
I should dance with particularly?

1293
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,354
Well, Cora opens it with Carson.

1294
01:20:34,562 --> 01:20:37,211
Not cousin Violet?
Not since my father died.

1295
01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:39,156
No. Mama ought to dance
with my valet but

1296
01:20:39,157 --> 01:20:40,772
we let it lapse while
Bates was here.

1297
01:20:40,796 --> 01:20:42,797
Perhaps Thomas will revive
the privilege.

1298
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:44,670
He's certainly got the nerve.

1299
01:20:44,758 --> 01:20:47,000
Then I join in with Mrs Hughes.
So perhaps it

1300
01:20:47,001 --> 01:20:49,242
would be nice if you
were to partner O'Brien.

1301
01:20:49,703 --> 01:20:51,356
Crikey.

1302
01:20:51,357 --> 01:20:54,414
By the way, Mary told me
about Mr Swire.

1303
01:20:55,053 --> 01:20:57,975
At least I was with him.
And we'd made our peace.

1304
01:20:58,694 --> 01:20:59,867
I didn't deserve it.

1305
01:21:00,359 --> 01:21:02,124
I let Lavinia down.

1306
01:21:02,351 --> 01:21:04,117
You were ready to marry her, Matthew.

1307
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:06,362
You would have kept your word.

1308
01:21:06,363 --> 01:21:09,363
You can't be blamed for feelings
beyond your control.

1309
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:12,605
If Swire had any inkling of that,

1310
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:14,622
he would have respected you for it.

1311
01:21:16,350 --> 01:21:18,357
Glug those drinks down,
we have to go in!

1312
01:21:45,354 --> 01:21:47,874
I gather Anna isn't gong to America.

1313
01:21:47,921 --> 01:21:49,355
No.

1314
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:51,356
But of course, I'm glad for her.

1315
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:57,374
Here he comes
to claim his prize.

1316
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:03,356
My Ladyship, may I have the honour
of this dance?

1317
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:06,100
Yes, it is a waltz.

1318
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:09,952
I'm far too old
for that awful foxtrot.

1319
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,371
What about the black bottom,
my Lady?

1320
01:22:11,372 --> 01:22:15,256
Just keep me upright.
Then we'll try to avoid it.

1321
01:22:34,897 --> 01:22:38,350
Daisy, I'm having trouble
understanding what you mean.

1322
01:22:38,351 --> 01:22:40,367
Are you saying you want to leave?

1323
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:43,975
No, I don't want to leave
unless I have to.

1324
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,833
But I want to move on.

1325
01:22:45,936 --> 01:22:47,372
I think I'm more than
a kitchen maid now.

1326
01:22:47,373 --> 01:22:51,356
I want to be a proper
assistant cook. I know I can be.

1327
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:54,350
I've no objection
if the budget stretches to it.

1328
01:22:54,687 --> 01:22:56,703
I'll have to ask Mrs Hughes
and Her Ladyship.

1329
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,501
I'll work for it, I promise.

1330
01:22:58,548 --> 01:23:01,982
Why couldn't you have spoken
of this sensibly the other night?

1331
01:23:02,045 --> 01:23:06,013
Instead of going off into a pet?!
Because I took the wrong advice.

1332
01:23:07,352 --> 01:23:09,352
I hope this isn't a practical joke.

1333
01:23:09,532 --> 01:23:11,532
It is a joke in a way, I'm afraid.

1334
01:23:20,446 --> 01:23:23,071
My dear, this... isn't what it seems.

1335
01:23:23,672 --> 01:23:25,212
Is there room for misinterpretation?

1336
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:26,704
But I can promise...

1337
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:30,353
Clearly, I have been managed
and steered by an expert hand.

1338
01:23:30,354 --> 01:23:32,354
Which I now see has not been yours.

1339
01:23:32,737 --> 01:23:34,737
Rosamund...
Don't. It's over.

1340
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:37,579
Don't make yourself ridiculous.

1341
01:23:37,768 --> 01:23:40,493
Good advice. Why not marry her?

1342
01:23:40,985 --> 01:23:44,258
She'll more than cover any social
flaws with her resourcefulness.

1343
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,367
Isn't that what I'm always saying?

1344
01:23:46,368 --> 01:23:48,363
You silly old whatnot.

1345
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:52,094
There are no more trains tonight.
So you'll have to leave first thing.

1346
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:54,223
Don't worry, we will.

1347
01:24:02,357 --> 01:24:04,047
Please forgive me but...

1348
01:24:05,354 --> 01:24:06,672
Damn!

1349
01:24:07,815 --> 01:24:10,813
Why? It's a lucky escape,
if you ask me.

1350
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:14,144
That's true, of course.

1351
01:24:15,742 --> 01:24:18,258
I just can't stand it
when Mama is proved right.

1352
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:41,350
Your Lordship, may I have a word?

1353
01:24:41,351 --> 01:24:43,368
Of course. How is Bates?

1354
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:46,358
Relieved. Shocked.

1355
01:24:46,359 --> 01:24:48,359
Tired. Grateful.

1356
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:50,360
I'm sure.

1357
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:55,836
My Lord, I wonder if I might
withdraw my resignation.

1358
01:24:57,627 --> 01:24:59,627
I was hoping you'd say that.

1359
01:25:12,365 --> 01:25:14,145
Do you want to dance?

1360
01:25:15,365 --> 01:25:17,365
Why not?

1361
01:25:26,865 --> 01:25:28,868
How are your plans
for America going?

1362
01:25:29,354 --> 01:25:32,362
I'll book my crossing as soon
as I hear back from Grandmama.

1363
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:38,079
Will you be gone long?

1364
01:25:39,369 --> 01:25:42,353
I don't know. I'll have to see.

1365
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,352
Do you think we can go to bed?
I expect so.

1366
01:25:54,353 --> 01:25:57,355
I think we've done our duty. Mama's
gone home and so has Isobel.

1367
01:25:57,356 --> 01:25:59,356
The girls?
Edith's upstairs.

1368
01:25:59,357 --> 01:26:02,364
And the last time I looked,
Mary was dancing with Matthew.

1369
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:04,365
Don't let's interfere with that.

1370
01:26:10,919 --> 01:26:12,919
I've written to Sybil.

1371
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:15,077
Sent her your love.

1372
01:26:18,682 --> 01:26:21,367
I won't be kept away from
my first grandchild, Robert.

1373
01:26:21,368 --> 01:26:24,368
I don't know what you mean.
I didn't quarrel with her.

1374
01:26:24,369 --> 01:26:27,351
I gave my permission.
I didn't fight it.

1375
01:26:27,352 --> 01:26:29,352
But you wouldn't go to the wedding.

1376
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,869
No.

1377
01:26:32,351 --> 01:26:34,351
It isn't what I wanted for her.

1378
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:37,788
None of it is.

1379
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:41,836
But this is what's happened
and we must accept it.

1380
01:26:44,078 --> 01:26:47,666
I want to go over there
and I want Sybil to come here.

1381
01:26:49,128 --> 01:26:50,557
And the chauffeur?

1382
01:26:51,347 --> 01:26:52,744
Him too.

1383
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:00,043
It's been a happy day, Robert.

1384
01:27:01,356 --> 01:27:03,356
Let's end on a happy note.

1385
01:27:21,794 --> 01:27:23,794
Tired already?

1386
01:27:23,851 --> 01:27:25,166
A bit.

1387
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:27,662
I was thinking about William.

1388
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:29,710
He always loved the ball.

1389
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,783
Miss O'Brien, Her Ladyship's
ready for bed.

1390
01:27:41,666 --> 01:27:44,659
I'm ever so glad Mr Bates
is going to be all right.

1391
01:27:45,397 --> 01:27:47,491
Well, he's alive.

1392
01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:50,163
I think we're quite a way
from all right.

1393
01:27:53,696 --> 01:27:55,349
Go on.

1394
01:28:02,998 --> 01:28:04,655
Are you pushing it?

1395
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:06,100
No. Are you?

1396
01:28:12,596 --> 01:28:14,596
That doesn't make sense.

1397
01:28:15,559 --> 01:28:17,146
Yes, it does.

1398
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:19,358
May they be happy.

1399
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,694
With my love.
What does that mean?

1400
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:33,397
I don't know.

1401
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,913
I suppose a spirit wants
some couple to be happy.

1402
01:28:38,965 --> 01:28:40,467
You were moving it.

1403
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:44,866
No, I wasn't. You were.

1404
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:58,350
That was fun.

1405
01:29:01,255 --> 01:29:04,245
There will be a few thick heads
in the morning.

1406
01:29:05,353 --> 01:29:07,353
No doubt they think it's worth it.

1407
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:14,098
You're really going to America.

1408
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:20,358
Would Carlisle make your life
a nightmare if you stayed?

1409
01:29:21,374 --> 01:29:22,748
I couldn't tell you.

1410
01:29:23,356 --> 01:29:24,709
Maybe.

1411
01:29:26,287 --> 01:29:29,301
Even if he does let me go,
my story is still out there.

1412
01:29:30,353 --> 01:29:32,353
And always will be.

1413
01:29:34,138 --> 01:29:35,498
Would you stay?

1414
01:29:37,059 --> 01:29:38,787
If I asked you to.

1415
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,908
Matthew, you don't mean that.

1416
01:29:43,353 --> 01:29:47,358
You know yourself we carry more luggage
than the porters at King's Cross!

1417
01:29:49,352 --> 01:29:51,352
And what about the late Mr Pamuk?

1418
01:29:52,102 --> 01:29:56,116
Won't he... resurrect himself
every time we argued?

1419
01:29:58,353 --> 01:29:59,738
No.

1420
01:30:03,474 --> 01:30:05,474
You mean you've forgiven me?

1421
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,350
No, I haven't forgiven you.

1422
01:30:10,664 --> 01:30:12,664
Well, then.

1423
01:30:13,603 --> 01:30:15,603
I haven't forgiven you because...

1424
01:30:17,766 --> 01:30:19,778
I don't believe you need
my forgiveness.

1425
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:24,832
You've lived your life
and I've lived mine.

1426
01:30:27,152 --> 01:30:30,151
And now it's time
we lived them together.

1427
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:34,351
We've been on the edge of this
so many times, Matthew.

1428
01:30:35,203 --> 01:30:38,212
Please don't take me there again
unless you're sure.

1429
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:40,567
I am sure.

1430
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:45,354
And your vows to the memory
of Lavinia?

1431
01:30:48,411 --> 01:30:50,192
I was wrong.

1432
01:30:52,663 --> 01:30:54,663
I don't think she wants us
to be sad.

1433
01:30:55,552 --> 01:30:59,125
She was someone who never caused a
moment's sorrow in her whole life.

1434
01:31:01,065 --> 01:31:02,492
I agree.

1435
01:31:04,785 --> 01:31:06,382
Then will you?

1436
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,264
You must say it properly.

1437
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:15,351
I won't answer unless you...

1438
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,553
kneel down and everything!

1439
01:31:29,529 --> 01:31:31,156
Lady Mary Crawley...

1440
01:31:34,135 --> 01:31:37,128
will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

1441
01:31:37,402 --> 01:31:38,992
Yes!

1442
01:32:08,353 --> 01:32:10,353

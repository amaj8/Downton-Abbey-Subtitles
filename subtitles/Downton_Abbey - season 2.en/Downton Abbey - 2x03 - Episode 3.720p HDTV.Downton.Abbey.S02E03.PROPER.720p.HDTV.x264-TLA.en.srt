Dawnton Abbey
Season 2, Episode 3

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,479
Should we give them some more space
between the beds?

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,519
Well, we could give them...
Not much.

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,119
I'm determined to defend the library
as a recreation room.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,879
Where are we to sit?
We can screen off the small library.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,959
Is that all? I suppose...
Or we could leave you the boudoir.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,439
I wanted to put the intermediaries
in there, but we don't have to.

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,960
How kind.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,879
Why will we only have officers? Surely
all wounded men need to convalesce.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,239
The hospital is for
officers. The whole idea

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,599
is to have a complimentary
convalescent home.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,759
Of course. But I don't know if we
can make that an absolute rule.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,639
If the world were logical, I would
rather agree with you.

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,440
Which comes as no surprise.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,559
You would not, I imagine.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,319
You imagine right.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,440
What these men will need is rest
and relaxation.

19
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,160
Will that be achieved by mixing ranks
and putting everyone on edge?

20
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,879
Granny!

21
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,999
Different ranks can relax together.
It has been known.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,719
Well, don't look at me.
I'm very good at mixing.

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,959
We always danced the first waltz at
the Servants' Ball, didn't we, Carson?

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,240
It was an honour, my lady. It's a lot
to ask when people aren't at their best.

25
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm searching for Lady Mary, Carson.
Will you tell her I'm in the library?

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,319
Don't loiter, Edith.
There's plenty to be done.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,038
Of course, but I'm not quite sure...

28
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,800
Sybil I wanted to have a quick word.

29
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,479
I'm going down to the village this
afternoon if anyone wants anything.

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,519
Some stamps would be kind.
I'll get you the money.

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,559
I'd like to thank you all
for your work this morning.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,959
It's so strange to see the rooms
converted into dormitories. But good.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,079
It was wrong for our
life to chug along as if

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,199
the war were only
happening to other people.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,359
How will it be, though? Are we all
working for Mrs Crawley, now?

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,639
We are not.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,799
I'm sure the chain of command will
be sorted out soon.

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,839
Or there'll be blood on the stairs.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Thank you, Miss O'Brien.

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,079
But what do you think it meant?

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,799
Really, Granny. Lavinia Swire knows
Richard Carlisle. So what?

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,839
One knows lots of people in London.

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,199
I don't know many people who'd
threaten me behind the laurels.

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,559
Aunt Rosamund said herself
she didn't know what to make of it.

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,199
I still think it's a peculiar way
for a gentleman to speak to a lady.

46
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
At least you think him a gentleman.

47
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:51,960
The point is, do you think
he's a gentleman?

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm not sure it matters much to me.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,879
Well I'm going up to London to stay
with Rosamund for a day or two.

50
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
I think we'll have Lavinia for tea.

51
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,199
You sound as if
you're going to gobble her up.

52
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,879
If only we could.

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,479
But where are they going to eat?

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,119
I understand from Mrs
Crawley that they'll share the

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,759
dining room with the
officers who are almost well.

56
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,959
So, am I running a canteen now?

57
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,579
William says
he's got time off between

58
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,199
the end of his training
and going overseas.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,319
He'll be with his father, surely?

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,279
He's going home first, but wants
to come here for his last night.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,479
You wouldn't mind that,
would you, Mr Carson? Certainly not.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,759
I'd be glad to wish him well
on his way.

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
Oh, for you, Mr Branson.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,079
Why do you think he's coming here?

65
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,839
To see us all and say goodbye.
What's wrong with that?

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,879
But suppose it's something more.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,479
Suppose he's got plans.

68
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,439
Well, you have to deal with that when
it happens and mind you deal fair.

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,040
Now go and grate that suet
before I grow old and die.

70
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,519
Who will be in charge?

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,559
Cousin Isobel thinks it'll be her.

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,479
All I know is that she'll drive us
mad before the end.

73
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm going up to change.
I just want to finish this.

74
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,479
Aren't you going to the hospital?
Not yet.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
I'm on a night shift.
I'll walk down after dinner.

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,480
And please don't start lecturing me.
I won't.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
The truth is I envy you.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,280
Do you ever miss helping out
on the Drakes' farm?

79
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,319
That's a funny question.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,359
Why?
No reason.

81
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,599
It's just you seemed to have
such a purpose there.

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,639
It suited you.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,679
It did suit me.

84
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,159
I enjoyed it,
but now I feel like a spare part.

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,799
Trust me.

86
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,039
You have a talent
that none of the rest of us have.

87
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Just find out what it is and use it.

88
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,600
It's doing nothing that's the enemy.

89
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,599
The truth is, my lady, Mrs Crawley
has forgotten this is your house

90
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,119
and we need a friend in charge of
the day-to-day management,

91
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,719
because if Mrs Crawley gets one of
her toadies in to run things,

92
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,479
she'll have her nose in every pie
before you can say Jack Robinson.

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
But who?

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,759
What about Thomas, my lady?

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,999
He's hospital trained and he's always
had a soft spot for Downton.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,239
Thomas, the footman?

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,799
Managing Downton Abbey?

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,879
But he's not a footman, now, is he?

99
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,639
He's a corporal, with real battle
experience as a medic.

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,679
Could Dr Clarkson spare him?

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,879
Well...

102
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,160
I suppose he'll have to spare
somebody.

103
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,719
Are you all right?

104
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
You seem a bit preoccupied.

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,439
I had a...

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,479
No, never mind.

107
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
What?

108
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
It was this afternoon,
in the village.

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,359
I thought I saw Mr Bates.

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,879
Bates?

111
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,719
Isn't he in London?

112
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,179
I might have been
wrong. I walked over to

113
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,639
where he was standing.
There was no sign of him.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,679
Do you know his address in London?

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,719
As long as he's still there. Why?

116
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
I'll telephone Sir Richard
and ask him to look into it.

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,719
But what would he know?
He works in newspapers.

118
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,920
A world of spies, tip-offs
and private investigators.

119
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
I promise you, he can find out
whatever he likes.

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,159
All right, then.
If you think he can help.

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,679
Good.

122
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,480
I'll ring him tonight.

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,519
Not bad.
Try to fit in a bit of practice.

124
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,680
We've plenty of time to get it right,

125
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,840
before there's anyone
to see me who matters.

126
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,719
I only know Sir Richard
because he is or was

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,280
a friend of my father's
and of my uncle, Jonathan Swire.

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,520
The Liberal minister?
That's it.

129
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,639
But I'm afraid they've fallen out.

130
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,919
This room is so pretty. Has the house
always been the Painswicks' London home?

132
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,639
There's no 'always'
about the Painswicks, my dear.

133
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,279
They were invented from scratch
by my son-in-law's grandfather.

134
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
We bought the house
when we were married.

135
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:53,039
You make Mr Painswick sound rather
a rough diamond, Lady Grantham.

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,759
Marmaduke wasn't a rough diamond,
was he, Mama?

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,960
No. He was just cut and polished
comparatively recently.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,599
Carson's told Papa
you've been called up.

139
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,079
There's no need to look so serious.

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,639
You'd think me rather heartless
if I didn't.

141
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,679
I'm not going to fight.

142
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
You'll have to.
I will not.

143
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,159
I'm going to be a conscientious
objector. They'll put you in prison.

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,559
I'd rather prison
than the Dardanelles.

145
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,439
When will you tell them?

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
In my own good time.

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't understand.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,679
I'll go to the medical.
I'll report for duty.

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,039
When I'm on parade, I'll march out
front and I'll shout it, loud and clear.

150
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,279
If that doesn't make the newspapers,
then I'm a monkey's uncle.

151
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,760
But you'll have a record
for the rest of your life.

152
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,320
At least I'll have a life.

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,600
I know the popular fantasy is
that we can feed six strong men...

154
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,439
from a single seed cake,
but you and I know better.

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Have we got the flour for any more?
Go and check now.

156
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,199
Cheer up.

157
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,439
It's not as bad as that.

158
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
What's the matter, Mr Lang?

159
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,360
Tell me. I won't bite.

160
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,680
I sometimes feel I'm the only one
who knows what's going on over there.

161
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,079
You all wander round ironing clothes

162
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,999
and cleaning boots and choosing
what's for dinner,

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,239
while over the Channel,
men are killed

164
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,959
and maimed

165
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,999
and blown to pieces.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,359
We know more than you think.
The war hasn't left us alone.

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
It hasn't left me alone,
however it may look.

168
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,079
Have you any idea...

169
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
how scared they are?

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,119
How scared they all are?

171
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,279
I lost my nephew.

172
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,319
My sister's boy.

173
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
He was shot.

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
For cowardice.

175
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,279
That's what they said.

176
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,440
But I knew him and he'd never
have done such a thing...

177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,600
if he hadn't have been
half out of his mind with fear.

178
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
Don't blame him.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,680
It was him,
but it could have been me.

180
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
It could have been any of us.

181
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,279
Suppose I don't want to come back?

182
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,000
To be in charge?
Telling Mr Carson what to do?

183
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,799
Why? What's in it for you?

184
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,559
All right. It's to stop Mrs Crawley
bossing her ladyship about.

185
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,599
She behaves as if she owns the place.

186
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,239
You've changed your tune.

187
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,399
When I were last here, you'd have given
money to see her ladyship eat dirt.

188
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,400
Well, like you say,
I've changed my tune. People do.

189
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,439
Not without a reason.
I've got my reasons.

190
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,199
You've also got her ladyship
wrapped round your little finger.

191
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,960
Maybe. That's my business.

192
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,079
But I'll not hurt her and I'll not
let anyone else hurt her, neither.

193
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
That's all I've got to say.

194
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
You're a queer one and no mistake.

195
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,760
So will you come if I can fix it?

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,120
Why not?

197
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,440
I like the idea of giving orders
to old Carson.

198
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,839
I go away for five minutes
and everything's settled.

199
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,879
Nothing's settled.

200
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,439
For a start,
which rooms will we live in?

201
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,479
The small library and the boudoir.

202
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,119
If Cousin Isobel can find somewhere
else for the intermediaries.

203
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,599
There's always the boot room.
I'm sure you'll have use of that.

204
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,319
And where are we supposed to eat?

205
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,199
You can share the dining room
with those officers...

206
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,999
No.
We all have to make sacrifices.

207
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,719
No!

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,679
Then we'll have tables
set up in the great

209
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,639
hall for the mobile
officers and the nurses.

210
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,999
And, Lady Grantham, I know you'll be
happy about one decision.

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,620
Lady Grantham asked
that the house management

212
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:10,240
might be put into the
hands of Corporal Barrow.

213
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,559
Your former footman, Thomas.

214
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,599
Thomas? In charge of Downton?

215
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,559
No, that's what I thought at first, but
he isn't a footman now, he's a soldier.

216
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,319
He's worked in medicine.

217
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,039
Someone has to run the place who's
had medical training. But I feel...

218
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,319
The men won't accept the authority
of a corporal. I've thought of that.

219
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,399
I told my Commanding Officer that Lady
Grantham had asked for Corporal Barrow.

220
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,679
He's prepared to have him raised
to the rank of Acting Sergeant.

221
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,400
But can you spare him?
We can.

222
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,159
I've gone to some trouble to do so.

223
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,679
Sergeant Barrow will
manage the daily running

224
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,199
of Downton and I shall
be in overall charge.

225
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,759
Aren't we missing a tier?
There should be someone

226
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,319
here, permanently, under
you but over Thomas.

227
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,119
That's correct and I will make
a decision before long.

228
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,639
Until then,

229
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,440
I do assure you,
Corporal Barrow is very efficient.

230
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,279
I say good.

231
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,519
If someone is to manage things,
let it be our creature.

232
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,320
Why? Are you planning to divide
his loyalties?

233
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
I wouldn't say I was planning it.

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,399
William has asked to stay here,
my lord. Just for a night.

235
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,439
On his way to active duty in France.

236
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,479
Good. I should like to see him.

237
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,279
I don't suppose there's any way
we can keep him from harm?

238
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,519
Him being an only child and all.

239
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,759
We'd hate for anything to happen.

240
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,160
Thank you, Lang. I can do the rest.

241
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Very sorry, my lord.

242
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,039
To get back to the notion of Thomas
as the manager of Downton.

243
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,079
He won't be a manager in that sense.

244
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,639
But her ladyship fixed
it all with Clarkson and

245
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,199
she was so pleased I
didn't know what to say.

246
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,199
'I cannot have him working here
because he is a thief'?

247
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,799
You know she's ignorant of
Thomas's crimes.

248
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,119
We agreed at the time
that would be best.

249
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,679
And anyway...

250
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,799
is it honourable in us to hold
Thomas's sins against him

251
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,959
when he has been wounded
in the service of the King?

252
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,399
And who is to be in charge
over Thomas?

253
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,399
You mean under Dr Clarkson?

254
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,639
Well, we asked today,
but he hasn't decided.

255
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,040
So we just make it up
as we go along?

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,240
Unless you've got a better idea.

257
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,839
Are you still here, Mr Branson?
Stay and have something to eat.

258
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,759
Mr Branson's been telling us the
news from Russia. What news is that?

259
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,479
Kerensky's been made Prime Minister,
but he won't go far enough for me.

260
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,479
Lenin denounces the bourgeoisie
along with the Tsar.

261
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,039
He wants a people's revolution and
that's what I'm waiting for.

262
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,119
It won't be long, now.
And what's happened to the Tsar?

263
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,439
Imprisoned. In the Alexander Palace.
With all his family.

264
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,439
What a dreadful thing.

265
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,999
They won't hurt them. Why would they?

266
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,199
To make an example?
Give them some credit.

267
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,479
This is a new dawn,
a new age of government.

268
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,119
No-one wants to start it with the
murder of a bunch of young girls.

269
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,559
You don't know that. Nobody knows who'll
get killed when these things start.

270
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,839
Look at her nephew.
Shot for cowardice.

271
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,199
Who'd have guessed that when he was
saying hello to the neighbours

272
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,719
or kissing his mother good night?
Can you look at the crumble?

273
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,439
I think it should come out, but it's
five minutes earlier than you said.

274
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,279
I'm sorry. I never thought.

275
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,319
Then you should think, Mr Lang.

276
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,960
You're not the only member of
the walking wounded in this house.

277
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,439
Why are you coming in this way?

278
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I'm the manager here now, Mr Carson.

279
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,919
Or had you forgotten?

280
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,959
No. I had not forgotten.

281
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,639
And will you be moving into
your old room?

282
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,079
Or should we prepare
a guest bedroom?

283
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,120
I'll sleep in my old room, thanks.

284
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,719
So...

285
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,959
Are we ready for the big invasion?

286
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,079
Cos they'll be here at teatime.

287
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,519
We'll have to be ready,
won't we, Thomas?

288
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,559
We will, Mr Carson.

289
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,799
And it's Sergeant Barrow, now.

290
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,120
'Acting Sergeant', I believe.

291
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,279
How many are there altogether?
36.

292
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,919
36. Right.

293
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,120
Quick as you can, gentlemen.

294
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,439
Driver, when you've finished
unloading here, go straight back.

295
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,479
This way please, gentlemen.

296
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Mustard gas...

297
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't worry.
We'll get you seen to quickly.

298
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,559
Major Bryant, you're in the Armada
bedroom. Do you mind the stairs?

299
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,600
It depends what I find at the top.

300
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,079
He's handsome.
Handsome and off-limits.

301
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,199
It'll be nice to have the house
full of men. Full of officers.

302
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,799
Officers aren't men.
Not where we're concerned.

303
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,680
Oh, speak for yourself. I speak for you,
too, if you know what's good for you.

304
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,920
I'm very sorry, but I...

305
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,719
Matthew! What in the world
are you doing here?

306
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,439
We start our tour of Yorkshire and
Lancashire tomorrow.

307
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,839
General Strutt knew you lived up
here, so he's given me a few hours off.

308
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,679
What a lovely... lovely surprise.

309
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,760
Mrs Crawley, how can we separate
the hospital's linen from our own?

310
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,079
You go. We'll talk later.

311
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,400
As soon as I've done this,
I'll take your orders for books.

312
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,759
I hadn't cast you
as Florence Nightingale.

313
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,599
We can't leave all the moral
high ground to Sybil.

314
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
She might get lonely there.

315
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,119
How are you? I know I mustn't ask
you what you're doing.

316
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,159
You can ask what I'm doing in
Downton.

317
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,459
We've finished in the
Midlands. Tomorrow, we

318
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,759
start on the camps in
the northern counties.

319
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,799
Will we see something of you?
My general ought to come here.

320
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,439
It's exactly the sort of thing people
like to read about. Sybil, come.

321
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,040
Edith can do that.

322
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,439
Dear Mother.
She does love a bit of authority.

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,879
I suppose she's driving
Cousin Cora mad.

324
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,120
No names. No pack drill.

325
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,680
Breathe in... and out.

326
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,599
I'm surprised they didn't get
to you before now.

327
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,639
Some people have all the luck, sir.

328
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,680
You can get dressed.

329
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,279
Shall I report for duty in Richmond?

330
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,320
You'll be told what to do.

331
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,639
But I must supervise
the medical staff. Overseen by me.

332
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,759
Carson, I'm relying on you to make
sure that that is so. What is going on?

333
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,999
I was arranging the household
duties,

334
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,119
where they overlap with the duties
of the nursing staff.

335
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,920
Shall we continue this upstairs?
Well, I've made up some charts...

336
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,840
Of course.

337
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,279
Did you say you were the manager
or the referee?

338
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,200
You see what we're up against.
Don't worry. We'll find a solution.

339
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,639
You take over every room,
you bark at me like a

340
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,079
sergeant major and you
give orders to my servants.

341
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,159
Cora, I'm sure - I'm sorry.
Are you in the middle of something?

342
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,159
We're discussing the arrangements.
Oh, good.

343
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,119
We've had a letter from Evelyn Napier.
He's in a hospital in Middlesbrough.

344
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,479
He's heard that we're
a convalescent home now

345
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,439
and wonders if he can come here
once he's released.

346
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,719
Of course he can come here.
Just a minute.

347
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,439
The Middlesbrough General
will have their own

348
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,159
arrangements for where
their patients convalesce.

349
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,919
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is right.

350
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,939
Downton must function as part of the

351
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,959
official system or it
cannot function at all.

352
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,719
Now I think perhaps I should make
one thing clear.

353
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,279
Downton is our house
and our home and we will

354
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,839
welcome in it any friends
or relations we choose.

355
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,279
If you do not care
to accept that condition,

356
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,639
then I suggest you give orders for
the nurses and patients and beds

357
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,760
to be packed up
and shipped out, at once.

358
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,840
Thank you, Lord Grantham,
for making your position so clear.

359
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,999
Oh, just one more thing. The dog.

360
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,199
What should we do to stop Isis
getting into the patients' rooms?

361
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,839
I can answer that.

362
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,599
Absolutely nothing.

363
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,399
Ah.

364
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,040
Anna, there you are. Ethel, could
you leave us for a moment?

365
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,759
That was Sir Richard
on the telephone.

366
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,559
It might have been Bates
you saw in the village.

367
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,199
Really?

368
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,239
He's working up here at a pub.

369
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
The Red Lion in Kirby Moorside.

370
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,199
That's odd.

371
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,039
Mr Bates in a pub?

372
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,320
The question is what'll you do with
the information now you've got it?

373
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,079
Could you just take this into
the hall for me? Yes, of course.

374
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,280
Are you waiting for Papa?
Do you want me to go and find him?

375
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,360
They turned me down.

376
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,359
The army.

377
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,119
Why?

378
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Apparently, I have a heart murmur.

379
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Or... to be more precise...

380
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,640
'A mitral valve prolapse is causing
a pansystolic murmur.'

381
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,719
I don't know what to say.
Is it dangerous?

382
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,920
Only if you're planning to humiliate
the British Army.

383
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,879
I suppose you're glad.

384
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,599
You're not going to be killed
or go to prison. Of course I'm glad.

385
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,479
Don't count your chickens. If I don't
get them one way, I'll get them another.

386
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,599
Why do you have to be so angry
all the time?

387
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,639
I know we weren't exactly
at our best in Ireland.

388
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,439
Not at your best?

389
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,160
Not at your best?

390
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I lost a cousin,
in the Easter Rising, last year.

391
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,959
You never said.
Well, I'm saying it now.

392
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,159
He was walking down
North King Street, one day,

393
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,999
and an English soldier saw him
and shot him dead.

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,679
When they asked why he was killed, the

395
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,359
officer said because he
was 'probably' a rebel.

396
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,759
So don't say you were
not at your best.

397
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Sorry to keep you waiting, but we're
going to have to step on it.

398
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,560
I'm not sure about Marryat. Not to
worry. I know we've got lots of GA Henty.

399
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,080
And I haven't forgotten
about your tobacco

400
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,520
- just as soon as I can
get into the village.

401
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,600
I think a bit of it
might have come loose.

402
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,919
Is that better?
Much.

403
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,639
But I may need some more tucking
very soon.

404
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,879
Well, no-one tucks better than I do.

405
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,519
Ethel.

406
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,559
Go back inside, please.

407
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,880
There are still more bedrooms
to be done.

408
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,639
'Rosamund's going to find out.'

409
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,719
She knows some of those feeble-minded
idiots on the Liberal front bench.

410
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,319
Poor Lavinia. I feel sorry for her.

411
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,919
She's an obstacle to your happiness,
dear, and must be removed.

412
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,639
When it's done,
you can feel as sorry as you wish.

413
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,159
But even if Matthew does break it
off with her,

414
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,039
why should he propose to me again?

415
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,520
With your permission, dear, I will
take my fences one at a time.

416
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
Any plans for your afternoon off?

417
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:00,119
Major Bryant wants me to go to the pictures
in York with him, when he's allowed out.

418
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
But you'll say that's stupid.

419
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,760
Not stupid. Insane.

420
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,639
Oh, he really likes me, though.

421
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,439
He says he wants
to get to know me better.

422
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,119
Has he told you how he's planning
to achieve it?

423
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,720
Spoilsport.

424
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,679
What are you up to?

425
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,360
Just practising with these for
Lady Mary. I promised her I would.

426
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,519
That's one and eight, altogether.

427
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Might I have a glass of cider?

428
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,040
Thank you.

429
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,960
I don't know if I've dreaded
this moment or longed for it.

430
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Well, either way, it's happened.

431
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,039
I'm glad I'm in time
for tomorrow's state visit.

432
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,199
I gather Lavinia will be there. We must
seize the opportunity to challenge her.

433
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,359
I don't really see on what basis.

434
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,139
She stole secrets from
her uncle, Jonathan Swire,

435
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,919
and gave them to Carlisle
to publish. Swire told me.

436
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,879
The papers showed that half
the Cabinet were trying to get rich

437
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,719
by buying shares before a government
contract was announced.

438
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,939
Would you rather we
were kept in ignorance?

439
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,159
It wasn't Lavinia's
business to make it public.

440
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,199
Without her, the Marconi scandal
would never have happened.

441
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,719
The politicians broke the law.
Lavinia did nothing wrong.

442
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,079
She drags the Chancellor
of the Exchequer's

443
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,439
honour through the mud
and you say it's nothing?

444
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,079
It was only Lloyd George.

445
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,799
But why did she betray her uncle
to Sir Richard in the first place?

446
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,000
Because... they were lovers.

447
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,639
Exactly.

448
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,119
And now it is down to you to save Matthew
from the clutches of a scheming harlot.

449
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,279
Really, Rosamund.
There's no need to be so gleeful.

450
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,479
You sound like Robespierre, lopping
off the head of Marie Antoinette.

451
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,359
It was me.

452
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,280
I knew you used to go into
the village on a Wednesday.

453
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,440
I so longed for a glimpse of you.

454
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,920
But why are you up here, at all?

455
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,639
And why didn't you tell me? Because
I want to get things settled first.

456
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,000
You see, I've discovered that Vera
has been unfaithful to me.

457
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,840
I've got proof.

458
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,959
We can't criticise her for that.

459
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,079
No, but it means I can divorce her.

460
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,039
I've had to leave the house to prove
that it has broken the marriage.

461
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,279
So I came up here to be nearer you.

462
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,960
But what if she fights it?
She can't.

463
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,559
For her to divorce me, she needs
something beyond adultery.

464
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,399
Cruelty or suchlike.

465
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,439
For a husband, adultery is enough.

466
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,479
That's not very fair to women.

467
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,080
I don't care about fairness,
I care about you.

468
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,919
The point is, I can get rid of her.

469
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,559
If she goes quietly, I will give her
money and plenty of it.

470
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
If not, she leaves empty-handed.

471
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,360
And when will this be? I need to get
her to accept it, first.

472
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,439
She's made threats
about selling stuff to the papers.

473
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,239
What stuff?

474
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,600
Don't worry.
They won't offer what I will.

475
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
You've changed your hair.

476
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,720
I was trying out Lady Mary's
new curling iron.

477
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,880
What do you think?

478
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,760
I think I would love you, however,
whatever, whenever.

479
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,959
We don't have to wait, you know.

480
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,719
If you want me to throw up
everything and come with you, I will.

481
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,359
Gladly.

482
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,960
I can't marry you yet, not legally,
and I won't break the law.

483
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
It's not against the law
to take a mistress, Mr Bates.

484
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,200
I know you, Anna Smith, and I love you
and that is not the right path for you.

485
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
It won't be long, now.

486
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
So, you're not going to war, then?

487
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,960
Apparently not.

488
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,359
Is it true about Mr Crawley bringing
a famous general here?

489
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,199
Captain Crawley.

490
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,800
But yes, why?

491
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,040
No reason.

492
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,899
If they arrive at five,
we'll walk him round the

493
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,479
wards, then show him the
recovering men at play.

494
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,119
After that, a fairly grand dinner.
I'll tell them to bring mess kit.

495
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,719
That is my challenge, my lord.

496
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,079
How to make the dinner sufficiently
grand with no footmen in the house.

497
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,679
Plenty of people give dinners
without footmen.

498
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,119
Not people who entertain Sir Herbert
Strutt, hero of the Somme.

499
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,239
I'm sure he'll have seen worse things at
the front than a dinner with no footmen.

500
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,359
Carson only wants to show the general
proper respect.

501
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,280
We will not criticise him for that.

502
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,199
Indeed we will not.

503
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,959
I think Lord Grantham's plan is a
good one, with or without a footman.

504
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,599
Matthew writes Miss Swire is coming
down from London for it.

505
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,239
Really?

506
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,160
He never said so to me.
Does he need your permission?

507
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,159
I think I should go round with him.

508
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,039
You and Lady Grantham will both
come with us.

509
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,439
But won't he want to talk about
the treatments?

510
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,120
The treatments... and the house.

511
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,760
Miss?

512
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,239
It's Captain Smiley, isn't it?

513
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,039
We haven't met yet,
but I'm Edith Crawley

514
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,839
and tomorrow I can show you
where everything is.

515
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,880
It's just that I'd like to write
a letter to my parents.

516
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,199
Of course. There's paper and
envelopes in the library.

517
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,239
No. You see, I've not written before.

518
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,760
I didn't want to worry my mother
with the different handwriting.

519
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,440
I'm left-handed. How's that for luck?

520
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,319
I'm surprised your school didn't
force you to use the right.

521
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,000
My mother wouldn't let them,
but now I wish they had.

522
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,599
I've asked the others and they say
you're the one to help me.

523
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,359
Of course I will.

524
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,119
I'd be happy to.

525
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
That's what they said.

526
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,159
If you can just...

527
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
find a way to tell her.

528
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,599
We'll both find a way.

529
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Together. I promise.

530
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,799
Mr Carson, might I have a word?

531
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,839
I'm busy with this dinner for
tomorrow night.

532
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,479
Well, that's just it. I don't expect you'll
be using Mr Lang, not after last time.

533
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,319
I will not.

534
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,679
So I wondered if I might be any help.

535
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,399
I've waited at table before.
Do you mean it?

536
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,399
I know I've no right
to ask it of a chauffeur.

537
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,680
We have to keep up the honour of
Downton, don't we?

538
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,879
I'm very grateful, Mr Branson. I'll
not hide it. Very grateful, indeed.

539
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,959
You know where to find a livery?
I do.

540
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,680
And I gather you won't be
leaving us, after all.

541
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,560
Who knows what the future will bring?

542
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,480
Aaa-aaargh!

543
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,679
Aaaargh!

544
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,719
Mrs Hughes? What is it?

545
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,759
Who is that shouting?

546
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
What's going on?
It's Mr Lang.

547
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
What in heaven's name is happening?

548
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,119
No! No, I can't do it!

549
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,759
Mr Lang?
I can't do it!

550
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,679
Wake up. You're having a bad dream.
You're having a dream.

551
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,359
It's the soldiers, Mr Carson,
soldiers, but I can't.

552
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,839
I can't go back,
no matter what they...

553
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,039
No-one is asking you to go back,
Mr Lang.

554
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,000
Just to put a sock in it. Don't worry.
You've had a bad dream. That's all.

555
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,720
Is it a dream?

556
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,240
Thank God.

557
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Oh, thank God.

558
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,800
Thank God. You're all right.
Let's get you back into bed.

559
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,680
You're all right.

560
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Mr Lang.

561
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I'm sorry.
You're all right.

562
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,720
Is it any wonder,
when he's been to hell and back?

563
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,040
Up.

564
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,600
Up.

565
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,999
My cousin, Lord Grantham.
Very kind of you, Lord Grantham.

566
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Welcome.
Lady Grantham.

567
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,279
And this is Major Clarkson
who runs our hospital here.

568
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,879
And I am Captain Crawley's mother
and will accompany you on your tour

569
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,959
and explain the different levels of
care we practise here.

570
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,839
Lady Grantham and Mrs Crawley will
both accompany us, as we go round, sir.

571
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,119
Makes a nice change from the craggy-faced
warriors I'm usually surrounded by.

572
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,879
I'd like to think that were true.
Please, come this way.

573
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,679
There's a large recreational room.
I don't believe...

574
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,039
Poor Mother. How she longs to hold
all the reins.

575
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,640
Crawley!

576
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,240
I should go, if only to keep
our respective mothers apart.

577
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,879
I'm afraid Mrs Crawley is none too
pleased to play second fiddle, sir.

578
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,879
Well, I hope she doesn't spoil
things.

579
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,279
Well, that's just what I've been
meaning to talk to you about, sir.

580
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm trying to run a tight ship...

581
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,439
What's the matter with your aunt?

582
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,879
We should follow them in or Mama
will say we're unsupportive.

583
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Tell me what it is, please.

584
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,600
All right.

585
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,039
I know he's going to propose.
Well, then you're going to accept.

586
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,199
Did you get that picture taken?
I did, yeah - Then fetch it.

587
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,439
If you think I'm going to stand by
and watch that boy's dreams

588
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,359
stamped in the dust, you've got
another think coming.

589
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,919
You can take back your promise
when the war's over and not before.

590
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,679
But it's a lie.

591
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,639
Don't make him give up
when he's off to face the guns.

592
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,320
You'd never forgive yourself
if owt happened.

593
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,199
Do you remember when
Aunt Rosamund found you

594
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,719
and Richard Carlisle
together in the garden?

595
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,479
I knew I'd hear more about that.
She thought he was threatening you

596
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,319
and now she's decided

597
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,640
that you were behind
the Marconi share scandal in 1912.

598
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,559
The Chancellor and other ministers
were involved, including your uncle.

599
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,399
I remember the Marconi Scandal.

600
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,639
No. Let's forget it. It's absurd.

601
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
But Lady Rosamund is right.

602
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,640
I did steal the evidence
for Sir Richard to print.

603
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,520
I did start the scandal.

604
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,759
The trouble is Aunt Rosamund can't
understand

605
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,799
why you would do such a thing,

606
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,839
unless you and Sir Richard were...

607
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,440
Were lovers.
Mary, you must come.

608
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,559
The ground floor rooms are for those
men who need the most care, sir.

609
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,599
Yes, of course.

610
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,639
General Strutt, sir.

611
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Oh, right, yes.

612
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,399
Tell me about this officer.
Who is that man?

613
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,839
I hope he's not complaining.
Oh, no. That's Captain Smiley.

614
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,239
He hasn't an unkind bone
in his body.

615
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,319
How do you know?

616
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,879
Matthew, listen to this.
Everything all right, sir?

617
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,559
What on earth is that about?
Oh, don't worry.

618
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,359
Major Holmes can be a little waspish, but
he wouldn't want to get us into trouble.

619
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,880
How do you know so much
about a pack of strangers?

620
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
They're not strangers to me.

621
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,879
This is all very impressive,
Lady Grantham.

622
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,199
The nurses and your own staff are
to be congratulated.

623
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,240
I believe they are.

624
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I wouldn't say I was scared.

625
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,880
I'm nervous, of course I am.

626
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,119
But not scared.

627
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,879
I think I'm ready.

628
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,519
Don't mind me.

629
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Only I'm thinking of what
your dear mother would say.

630
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,159
Well, I wish she was here
to see me off.

631
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,360
Oh, she'd be so proud.

632
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,080
Why, when we waved off our Archie,
I remember...

633
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,279
What do you remember, Mrs Patmore?

634
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
I'll tell you.

635
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,399
You remember a fine young man,
who enlisted before he had to,

636
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,759
and who gave his life
for his country,

637
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,799
because he'd be alive and well today,
if he hadn't chosen to go to war.

638
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,599
She's right.

639
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,599
Happen she is.

640
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Come on, Daisy.
Back to the grindstone.

641
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,479
What is it?
I just want a word with Daisy.

642
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,520
I'm needed in the kitchen.

643
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,520
There's plenty of time later on.

644
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,920
Let's see what my aim is
like.

645
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,279
And again.

646
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,039
You must be enjoying your respite
from the front.

647
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,679
Actually, I'm struggling a bit.

648
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,839
I've just lost my soldier servant and
I haven't managed to replace him yet.

649
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,079
So, when will you tell Matthew?

650
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,119
Dinner is served, my lady.

651
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Don't waste the opportunity.

652
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,279
Why must she be so savage?
It's my broken heart.

653
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,799
It was her advice that wrecked it in
the first place. Classic Rosamund.

654
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,360
She's never more righteous than
when she's in the wrong. Come on.

655
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,920
Everything all right, Mr Branson?
I think so, Mrs Hughes.

656
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,799
Where's Mr Branson?
He's just taken up the soup. Why?

657
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,519
Read that.

658
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,439
'They'll have arrested me by now,
but I'm not sorry.'

659
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
'The bastard had it coming to him.'

660
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,920
Oh!

661
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,280
What in God's name?
Read this.

662
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,680
Where is he now?
Oh, my God.

663
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,640
Thinking of renovating
the entire stable...

664
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,080
I'm sorry to hear about
your servant.

665
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,959
Pneumonia not a bullet.

666
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,599
No!

667
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,200
Yes.

668
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,959
I don't envy you.

669
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,160
A decent servant can change
your war.

670
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Get downstairs now!

671
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,119
All right, all right!
There's no need to be so rough.

672
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:07,319
There's every need to stop a murder!
Murder? What do you mean, 'murder'?

673
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,280
You were going to assassinate the
general! Kill the general? I was not.

674
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,760
Eurgh! I was going to throw that lot
all over him.

675
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:19,439
What is it? Oil and ink and a bit of
a cowpat, all mixed with sour milk.

676
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,559
He'd have needed a bath right enough,
but not a coffin.

677
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,439
I thought you'd taken the soup up,
but you left it in the pantry.

678
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,439
We'll use this. It's not been heated,
but the hell with that!

679
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,679
We'll decide what happens to you
later!

680
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,599
Never mind later, what about now?
How do we keep this dinner going?

681
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,999
I'll serve, Mr Carson. I don't mind.

682
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,600
And who knows when I'll have
the chance again.

683
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,319
What was going on with the soup?

684
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,159
It came. It went.
Nothing to worry about, my lord.

685
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,599
Branson was taken ill, so William
volunteered to be footman, one last time.

686
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,039
You don't mind, do you? Oh, not
a bit. It's very kind of him.

687
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,879
Our footman, William, is leaving us
tomorrow to join his regiment.

688
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,479
That's why he's not in livery. You're are
a credit to this house and this country.

689
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,639
There is no livery so becoming
as a uniform.

690
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,240
Sir.

691
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,880
Lady Rosamund, Mary, all of you,
have been so kind to Lavinia.

692
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,919
Well, naturally we're all curious
to know more of Miss Swire,

693
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,280
if she is to reign over Downton
as queen.

694
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,319
Dear me. I hope you haven't
unearthed anything too fearful.

695
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,120
You must ask Mary.

696
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,839
One thing I am still not
quite clear about.

697
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,159
Who precisely is in charge of
Downton when you're not here?

698
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,519
I've given it some thought, sir,
and it seems to be only fair

699
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,559
that Mrs Crawley

700
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,079
and Lady Grantham should share
that responsibility.

701
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,119
Capital. Well said.

702
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,479
The fact is I have been more than
gratified by my visit here today

703
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,679
and I thank Captain Crawley
for arranging it.

704
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,839
Hear, hear.

705
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,039
You are all to be praised for your
response to our national crisis,

706
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,040
but I've been talking
and I've been listening.

707
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,079
I feel there is one among you

708
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,280
whose generosity is in danger of
going unremarked.

709
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,259
It seems the daily cares
and needs of the patients

710
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,959
are being dealt with,
quietly and efficiently,

711
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,599
by Lady Edith.

712
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,919
Or that's what the officers tell me.

713
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,399
So, let us raise our glasses

714
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,200
and drink her health.

715
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,559
Edith. Darling.
Lady Edith.

716
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,160
Edith, dear.

717
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,839
We were never lovers, not ever.

718
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,879
You don't have to explain anything.

719
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,880
Not to me.
But I want to.

720
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,680
You see...

721
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,679
My father owed Sir Richard Carlisle
a lot of money.

722
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,480
Enough to bankrupt him.

723
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,559
And Sir Richard offered
to waive the debt,

724
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,599
if you gave him the evidence
of the ministers' guilt?

725
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,439
Papa was terrified

726
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,920
and I knew I could get into my
uncle's office and find the proof.

727
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,880
What is it?

728
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,400
He threatened to tell you all about
it and now I've told you anyway.

729
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,399
My uncle was guilty.

730
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,159
They all were.

731
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,199
Sir Richard didn't make it up.

732
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,039
I believe you.

733
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
But that's not why I did it.

734
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,440
It was entirely to save Papa
from ruin.

735
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,920
I'll just go in and check
that everything is ready.

736
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,479
Have you got that picture for me?

737
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,280
I might have.

738
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,439
Because...

739
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,920
You know what I'm going to ask you,
so... will you?

740
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,239
William, you're not sure.

741
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,879
You can't be sure.

742
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,199
I am sure.

743
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,079
And so is she, aren't you, Daisy?

744
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,239
Isn't this just what you told me
you hoped would happen?

745
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,200
It's like a fairy story.

746
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,719
Is she right, Daisy? Are...

747
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,479
Are we engaged?

748
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,319
Because if we are,

749
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,680
I know I can tackle
whatever may come.

750
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,960
Go on, then.

751
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,480
William?

752
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,639
Do you want to go up top?

753
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,119
The general is leaving and Mr Carson
likes a full complement.

754
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,959
No, Daisy. Not you.

755
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,960
The war has not changed everything.

756
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,979
The general is just about to leave. I'm

757
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,079
afraid he doesn't have
time to come in here.

758
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,960
I hope it's all been a success.

759
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,639
Cousin Violet said you had something
to say to me about Lavinia.

760
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,280
What is it?

761
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,879
I haven't the slightest idea.
Oh.

762
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,680
What a relief. She was hinting you
had uncovered some horrid stain.

763
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,479
The only evidence I've uncovered is
that she's a charming person.

764
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,480
What a testimonial.

765
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,400
The truth is we're very much alike,
so naturally I think she's perfect.

766
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,359
We all do.

767
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,399
Don't we, Aunt Rosamund?

768
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,000
Quite perfect.

769
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,359
Is there any chance you might take
our footman William, for your servant?

770
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,359
I can pull some strings, get him
transferred to your lot.

771
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,639
If you'd like me to, of course, but
I can't promise to keep him safe.

772
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,560
I know, but he'd have someone
looking out for him.

773
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,319
Oh, my God.

774
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Lang, are you all right, old chap?

775
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,679
Come, come, man.

776
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,719
Things can't be as bad as all that.

777
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,759
Carson?
Mr Lang, what's happened?

778
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,399
Sir...

779
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,600
The general and all these
officers...

780
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,239
I don't have to go back with them,
do I? Because... I can't, sir. No.

781
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,159
The general is looking for you,
my lord. Excuse me.

782
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,199
It's been a great pleasure.

783
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,320
If I don't see you again
before I have to go back, be safe.

784
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,320
You, too.

785
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,120
Come inside.

786
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,960
Up!

787
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,159
Here. We've earned it.

788
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,760
Ah...

789
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,959
So, what will you do with him?

790
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,799
Branson or Lang?

791
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,639
Not Mr Lang.

792
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,279
He isn't well,
but he's not a bad man.

793
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,520
No, not at all, but he doesn't
belong at Downton.

794
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,119
I meant, Mr Branson.

795
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,359
Hm, it's a delicate business,
Mrs Hughes.

796
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,399
Would we really be right to tell
the police and cause a furore

797
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,759
and bring a riot down on our heads?

798
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,920
And all because he wanted to pour
a pot of slop over a man's head.

799
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,319
From your phrasing, I gather
the answer you want from me is no.

800
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,359
Would it help, Mrs Hughes?

801
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:32,160
That's all I'm asking.
Would it help?

802
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,679
Where's Mr Branson? Mr Carson sent him back
to his cottage to stew in his own juice.

803
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,839
Will we see you in the morning,
William, to wish you luck?

804
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,479
Oh, yes.

805
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,120
But I've got something I'd like to say
now, if you don't mind. Don't. Not yet.

806
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,839
They must know sooner or later.

807
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,959
Daisy and I...
are going to be married.

808
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,119
You never are! When?

809
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,159
After the war.

810
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,160
I'm not sure I can wait that long.

811
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:18,799
I see what I had planned to say is
already superfluous, Mr Lang.

812
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,800
You got there before me.

813
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,559
I've let you down, Mr Carson,
for that, I'm sorry.

814
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,599
We let you down.

815
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,920
You weren't suited for work
and I should have spotted that.

816
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,120
You'll have two months' wages and
please tell us how you get on.

817
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,559
And, when you're ready for work
again,

818
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,919
you may rely on
a good report from me.

819
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,520
That's kind.

820
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,120
Thank you.

821
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,239
It was nice of William to serve
tonight. He didn't have to.

822
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,239
I'm going to arrange for him
to be Matthew's servant.

823
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:02,799
With any luck,
it'll keep him out of trouble.

824
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,399
Matthew and Mary looked so natural
together. Did you notice?

825
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Talking and laughing.

826
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,199
But I suppose Lavinia is a nice girl.

827
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,000
We've dreamed a dream, my dear,
but now it's over.

828
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,519
The world was in a dream
before the war,

829
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,000
but now it's woken up
and said goodbye to it.

830
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,120
And so must we.

831
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,799
I'll stay until you want
to run away with me.

832
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,000
Am I to see if Sir Richard Carlisle
has a brother?

833
00:52:42,001 --> 00:52:45,439
One who's even richer than he is?
What's the matter with you?

834
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,879
I'm on your side.
Then be on my side.

835
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,999
If I am not appreciated
here, I will seek some

836
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,119
other place where I
will make a difference.

837
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,759
Good.

838
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,079
I am a woman, Mary,
I can be as contrary as I choose.

839
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,559
Watch yourself, Mr Bates.
Thomas is in charge now.

840
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,600
We don't need anyone with us.

841
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,720
Matthew's missing.

842

1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,160
We can put the presents
in the drawing room

2
00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:43,680
against the window.
Very good, m'lady.

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,340
I suppose we do have to
display all the presents.

4
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:48,960
It can look rather greedy.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,560
I can't bear the disruption we've
brought on your heads. Don't be silly.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,480
How are you feeling? I just wish I could
get rid of this damn stick. Sorry.

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,100
Don't be. If anyone has a
right to swear, it's you.

8
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:06,680
Don't bully yourself.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
Think of where we were a few months
ago and smile. I quite agree.

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,760
I want to make it up and down that
aisle without assistance. Up, yes.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,240
You'll have me to lean on coming
down.

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,680
You still have three full days
of practise so never say die.

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,560
My goodness, is that the time?

14
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,400
I must be getting back.
I'll go with you.

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,400
She's just sucking up, Mother.
Any bride who doesn't suck up

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,920
to her husband's mother is a fool.

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Can I bother you?

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Mrs Bryant has written a letter
I did not expect.

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,280
She says her husband wants to see
the baby. They both do.

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,680
Isn't that what you hoped?
Yes and no.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,700
Remember what he was like last time?
I don't want to

22
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,680
build up Ethel's hopes again.
Ethel's not important.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,080
It's the boy's chances you have to
look to. I believe you're right,

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,000
though we come at it by different
routes.

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,300
Why announce it tonight,
all of a sudden?

26
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,560
He's got a job at a newspaper.

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
He heard today, it's a real chance.

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,800
Let him go to Dublin then you can
use the calm to consider.

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,640
Mary doesn't want you
to be trapped before

30
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,440
you're completely sure.
But I am sure!

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,520
How many times do I have to say it?!
Anna, tell them!

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Lady Mary's right.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
It's a big thing, to give up
your whole world. Thank you.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
Listen to her if you won't listen
to me. I'm not giving up my world!

35
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,220
If they give me up,
that's their affair!

36
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm perfectly happy to carry on
being friends with everyone.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Married to the chauffer?
Yes.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,640
Anyway, he's a journalist now,
which sounds better for granny.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,240
We're going to tell papa tonight.

40
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,480
We? You mean, you and Branson?

41
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,520
He's coming in after dinner.

42
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,320
What will papa do?
I imagine he'll call the police.

43
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,160
Downton is not a hostel.
No, Mr Carson.

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,600
You made such a point
of not being a servant

45
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:20,000
any more, our ears
are ringing with it.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,960
Trouble is, I'm a little out
of pocket at the moment.

47
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,880
I cannot say that
I'm sympathetic

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,760
when you dabble in the black market.

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,240
I just need some more time,
Mr Carson.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,440
How long is it since the last
patient left, Sergeant?

51
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,160
You're trespassing on our generosity.
I'll try to make myself useful.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,640
Just find somewhere to go.

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,480
Yes?

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm here.
So I can see.

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,860
It's not such a good idea.
We mustn't worry granny.

56
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:12,600
You asked me to
come and I've come.

57
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,580
Would someone please tell
me what is going on or

58
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,520
have we all stepped through
the looking glass?

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,680
Your grandmother has as much right
to know as anybody else.

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
Why don't I find that reassuring?

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,920
How much longer is Mr Carson
going to be? It's never worth

62
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,680
trying to make food interesting
in the servants hall.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
You're very quiet this evening.

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,460
I've had a letter off Mr
Mason, William's dad.

65
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes. What does he want?

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,600
To see me. You're his daughter-in-law,
why shouldn't he see you?

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,520
I wish it were as simple. I think
it is but I'll not reopen the wound.

68
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,680
'What do you mean, you knew?'
I hoped it would blow over.

69
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,480
I didn't want to split
the family when Sybil

70
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:00,240
might still wake up.
You've driven me about,

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
bowing and scraping and seducing
my daughter behind my back?!

72
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:06,040
I don't bow and scrape and
I've not seduced her.

73
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,620
Give your daughter some credit
for knowing her own mind.

74
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,160
How dare you use that tone!

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,560
You will leave at once!
Papa! This is a folly!

76
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,320
A ridiculous, juvenile madness!
Sybil, what do you have in mind?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,400
Mama, this is hardly ... No,
she must have something in mind.

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,920
Otherwise she wouldn't have summoned
him here tonight.

79
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Thank you, Granny.
Yes, we do have a plan.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Tom's got a job on a paper.

81
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,960
I'll stay for the wedding.
I don't want to steal their thunder.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,040
But after that, I'll go to Dublin.

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,040
To live with him? Unmarried?

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,480
I'll live with his mother
while the bands are red.

85
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,480
And then we'll be married.

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,280
And I'll get a job as a nurse.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
What does your mother make of this?

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,760
If you must know, she
thinks we're very foolish.

89
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:00,520
So, at least we have
something in common.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,160
I won't allow it! I will not allow
my daughter to throw away her life!

91
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,520
You can posture all you
like, Papa, it won't

92
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,840
make any difference.
Yes, it will! How?

93
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,640
I don't want any money! You can
hardly lock me up until I die!

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,160
I'll say goodnight.

95
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,080
But I can promise you one thing.

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,200
Tomorrow morning, nothing will have
changed.

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
Tom.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,320
He's not coming here!

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,200
I don't want him to see this place.

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,200
I won't have him pity me.
The question is are

101
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,160
you prepared to let them
in to Charlie's life?

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,640
I suppose so, yes.
Good.

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,620
I'll ask them to Downton
for Monday at four

104
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,600
and this time, it'll
be all above board.

105
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Can't expect to live here free forever.
I didn't expect to get booted out.

106
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,720
You'll have to find some work.

107
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,480
It's not that easy. Every Tom, Dick and
Harry's looking for work these days.

108
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,920
And they all don't have a hand
like a Jules Verne experiment.

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,640
Mr Branson. I know it wasn't easy
last night.

110
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,600
You should have spoken out long ago.
Spoken out about what?

111
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,360
Why not?

112
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,880
Lady Sybil and I are getting
married.

113
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,960
Have you no shame?!

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm sorry you feel like that,
Mr Carson. You're a good man.

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,600
But, no, I have no shame.

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,500
In fact, I have great
pride in the love of that

117
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,360
young woman and I will
strive to be worthy of it.

118
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,400
I will not disgrace myself by
discussing it, nor will anyone else.

119
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,400
Now, if you will go, Mr Branson,
we will continue with our day.

120
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,880
Leave an address where we will forward
what is owing to you. No problem.

121
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll be at the Grantham Arms until Lady
Sybil is ready to make her departure.

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
I bid you all a good day.

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,600
Is it really true?
Please! I have asked for silence.

124
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,960
And silence I will have.

125
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,400
What on Earth is it? A gramophone.
Some cousins of mine have given it.

126
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,920
You should stand well clear

127
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,400
when you light the
blue touch paper.

128
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,640
All on your own?

129
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,720
I've left space at
the front for Jules.

130
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:48,160
I know Lavinia's getting
something from papa.

131
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,520
And from me. As she's so slight,
a real necklace would flatten her.

132
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,800
What news of Sybil?
Papa is with her now.

133
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm afraid it'll end in tears.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,720
Maybe, but they won't be Sybil's.

135
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,160
I used to think that Mary's beau
was a Leonce but compared to this,

136
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,720
he's practically a Hapsburg.

137
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,160
Don't worry. Your turn will come.

138
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,160
Will it? Or am I just to be
the maiden aunt?

139
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,320
Isn't this what they do? Arrange
presents for their pretty relations?

140
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,760
Don't be defeatist, dear,
it's very middle class.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,560
I'd better go up and support your
father.

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,500
Your threats are
hollow, don't you see?

143
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:37,400
I won't be received in London?
I won't be welcome at court?

144
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
How do I make you understand,
I couldn't care less?

145
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,480
I do hope I'm interrupting
something.

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,680
I only wish you were. I seem to be
getting nowhere. Have you seen Cora?

147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
She's lying down.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,680
And can we blame her?

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,640
Now, Sybil, dear, this sort of thing is
all very well in novels, but in reality,

150
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,520
it can prove very uncomfortable

151
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,200
and while I am sure Branson
has many virtues...

152
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,080
No, no, he's a good driver.
I will not give him up!

153
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,600
Don't be rude to your grandmother.
No, she's not being rude. Just wrong.

154
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,920
This is my offer.

155
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,720
I will stay one week to avoid
the impression I've run away

156
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,320
and because I don't want to
spoil Matthew's wedding.

157
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,880
Then we will marry in Dublin

158
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,480
and whoever wishes to visit
is welcome. Out of the question!

159
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,120
Will you forbid Mary and Edith?
No, no.

160
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't say anything you
may have to retract.

161
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,480
Know this. There will be no more
money.

162
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,400
From here on in, your life
will be very different. Well...

163
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,880
Bully for that.

164
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,600
I thought this might tide
you over...

165
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,480
Whatever's the matter?
I'm sure I'll be all

166
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:58,320
right if I can just stay
still for a moment.

167
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,180
You will not stay still.
Not down here.

168
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,000
Get to bed this minute.
I'll send for the doctor.

169
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,720
I can't. We've got the Crawleys
tonight and Miss Swire.

170
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,520
What with this business of Lady
Sybil. I'll deal with it.

171
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,320
Look, get Mr Mosley to help.
There's no need. I mean it!

172
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,360
The war is no longer an excuse for
sloppy presentation. Very well,

173
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll ask him, but only on condition
you go to bed.

174
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,040
Are you too hot in that, m'lady?
You still have time to change.

175
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
No. Thank you.

176
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,720
So, what do we do next?
God knows!

177
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,840
This is what comes of spoiling her.

178
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,700
The mad clothes, the nursing.

179
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:54,520
What were we thinking of?
That's not fair.

180
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,960
She's a wonderful nurse
who's worked very hard.

181
00:11:56,961 --> 00:11:59,360
And she's forgotten who she is!

182
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,440
Has she, Robert? Or have we
overlooked who she really is?

183
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,240
If you're turning American on me,
I'll go downstairs.

184
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,820
Mr Carson likes to serve
two white wines which

185
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:16,520
you should open and decant
just before they eat.

186
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,000
A light one for the hors d'oeuvres,
a heavy one with the soup.

187
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,320
Keep that going for the fish then change
to claret which you need to decant now.

188
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,840
There's a pudding wine and,
after that, whatever they want in

189
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,360
the drawing room with their coffee.
It's a wonder they make it upstairs.

190
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
They don't drink
much of any of it.

191
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,200
Let me show you the decanters.
These four...

192
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,600
So, I don't have to receive
that terrible man again.

193
00:12:39,601 --> 00:12:41,960
It won't be necessary.

194
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,120
They'll meet her in here but...
Should you be downstairs, m'lady?

195
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,960
I'm perfectly all right,
thank you.

196
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Why Mosley? I could have done it.

197
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,320
But you always make a mountain
out of not being a servant.

198
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,280
I'm just trying to be helpful.

199
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,280
I'm afraid, "being helpful", is not
something we associate you with.

200
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,880
It's wonderful what fear
can do to the human spirit.

201
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,360
You quite right, Mr Mosley?

202
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, I just want to be absolutely
sure

203
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
that this is the lighter wine.

204
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,600
What does it matter as
long as it's white? No.

205
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,240
I believe in starting the way
you mean to go on.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,840
Don't want to get off on the wrong
foot.

207
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,040
I'm glad you're here, Sybil.

208
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,200
I was afraid you'd have
a tray in your room.

209
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,200
Maybe you should have done.
Why?

210
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,180
I'm not eloping like a
thief in the night.

211
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:44,120
I might have once but Mary and
Edith talked me out of it.

212
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,920
The plot thickens.

213
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,320
After all, Sybil's had time
to think about it. Mother!

214
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,880
It is not for us to have an opinion.

215
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,520
Mr Mosley, are you quite well?

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm all right, thank you, sir.
I don't believe you are.

217
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,360
The awful truth is, I'm not quite
all right. I'm afraid I'm going

218
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,240
to ask you to excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

219
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,960
Would you like us to call
Dr Clarkson? No, it's too late.

220
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
He's coming for Mr
Carson, Your Lordship.

221
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,480
I'll bring him up
when he arrives.

222
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,960
I can sleep in my dressing room.

223
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm glad I've got you.
What you serving?

224
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,320
They're on the main course
so I can spare a moment?

225
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,400
I've been thinking and...

226
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,080
I have to say something
that you won't agree with.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
We're going to get married.

228
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,120
We can't. Not now.
You're not listening.

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,200
Go to Ripon tomorrow and take out
a special license,

230
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
I don't care how much it costs,
and fix the day.

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,680
We'll tell no-one, but this,
you will do. I can't.

232
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,760
Aren't I as strong as Lady Sybil?
I don't doubt that.

233
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,080
Well, then, if she can do it,
so can we.

234
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,520
That's what I've been thinking.

235
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,880
I have stuck by you, through thick
and thin.

236
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,360
Thin and thin, more like.

237
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,680
Mr Bates, if we have to face this,
then we will face it

238
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,680
as husband and wife and will not be
moved to the sidelines

239
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,000
to watch from a distance, with no
right even to be kept informed.

240
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,600
I will be your next of kin.

241
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,280
And you can't deny me that.
Anna!

242
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,600
You better come, quick.

243
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,240
Mr Mosley? What's happened?

244
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Haven't you taken it in yet?
I'm not well. I'm not well, at all.

245
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
First, Mr Carson then her ladyship
and now him.

246
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,020
Help him down to
the servants hall.

247
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:52,840
The doctor can look at him,
too, when he gets here.

248
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,280
Spanish flu has found it's way
to Yorkshire. And to Downton.

249
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,900
Dr Clarkson says
he's got ten cases.

250
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,480
I thought Mosley had
joined the Temperance League.

251
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm afraid he's been taken ill, My Lord.
I'm sorry. Mosley, too? Good heavens.

252
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,480
Everyone's falling like ninepins.

253
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,840
Lavinia?

254
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you know, I'm not at all well,
either.

255
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,000
I wonder if I could lie down for a
minute? Of course. Come to my room.

256
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,240
They'll have lit the fire by now.
Excuse me.

257
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,200
Do you think we should take her
home? No, let her rest for a moment.

258
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,160
Well, I think I should go and help.

259
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris
when cholera broke out?

260
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,880
Half the guests were dead before they
left the ballroom. Thank you, Mama.

261
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,680
That's cheered us up no end.

262
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,480
I'll take you to Mr Carson now and then
to see Mr Mosley in the servant's hall.

263
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Dr Clarkson, you're kind to come.
How is she?

264
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,080
Not too bad but she'll need some
nursing for a day or two.

265
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,860
Don't worry about that, all our
daughters are professionals.

266
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,600
Let's leave her
to get some rest.

267
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,800
Miss Swire may be
another victim.

268
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,960
She's sleeping now, I don't
want to disturb her.

269
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,500
When she wakes give her
some aspirin, cinnamon and

270
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:31,000
milk and keep her here.
I'll look at her tomorrow.

271
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,600
We better go to Carson.
I'll come, too.

272
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,640
Where is everyone?
I'm not sure.

273
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,240
Cousin Violet's gone home.
What about you?

274
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,880
I'm waiting for Lavinia and mother.

275
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,120
Dr Clarkson wants Lavinia to stay
here. He'll see her tomorrow.

276
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,800
I don't know this one.
Actually, I rather like it.

277
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,760
I think it was in a show
that flopped.

278
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,680
Zip Goes A Million, or something.

279
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,440
Can you manage without your stick?
You are my stick.

280
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,520
We were a show that flopped.

281
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,840
God, Mary.

282
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
I'm so, so sorry.

283
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,080
You know how sorry I am.

284
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,520
Don't be.

285
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,840
It wasn't anyone's fault.

286
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
If it was, it was mine.

287
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,400
You know cousin Violet came to me,
told me to marry you.

288
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,520
When was this?
A while ago.

289
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,760
When we knew I would walk again.

290
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,960
Classic granny.

291
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,120
What did you say?

292
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,480
I couldn't accept Lavinia's
sacrifice of her life.

293
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,560
Her children, her future and then give
her the brush off when I was well again,

294
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
well, I couldn't, could I?

295
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,880
Of course not.

296
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,760
However much I might want to.

297
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,200
Absolutely not.

298
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,000
Hello?

299
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
What are you doing up?

300
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,000
Shouldn't we be getting back.
It's decided.

301
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
You're staying here.

302
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,160
Dr Clarkson's coming in the morning
so he can treat you all together.

303
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,640
You can borrow some things until
Matthew brings you what you need.

304
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll go and organise a room.

305
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,880
How do you feel?

306
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,800
Like a nuisance.
You could never be that.

307
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,520
I mean it, Matthew.
Don't ever let me be a nuisance.

308
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,440
Don't ever let me get in the way,
please.

309
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,680
I'll sleep on a chair in her room.
There's no need for that. I don't mind.

310
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,760
I'd like to be on hand.
So, we're quite the hospital again.

311
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,480
You'll probably gain more patients
over the next few da...

312
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,920
You don't need to worry about
Mosley. He'll be fine in the morning.

313
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,480
The others have Spanish flu.
He's just drunk.

314
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,560
Did you want Mr Bates, My Lord?

315
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,200
I forgot to say I want to be
woken early. I can tell him that.

316
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,040
Freddie got into Ripon Grammar,
so whatever you said, it worked.

317
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,240
Marvellous, some good news at last.

318
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,120
I hate to hear you talk like that.
I'm sorry, that was selfish of me,

319
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,440
to spoil your happy moment.
You need never say sorry to me.

320
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,240
How are you?

321
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Really?

322
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,760
Since you ask, I'm wretched.

323
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,560
I lost my youngest child today,
I suspect forever, and I can't

324
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,560
see any way round it. I wish
you knew how much I want to help.

325
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,360
Do you?

326
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,320
I think you know I do.

327
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,280
I'll see if I can get up tomorrow.
Don't be foolish.

328
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,120
You're ill and in all probability,
you'll be a lot iller in the morning.

329
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,360
How will you manage?
What about the wedding?

330
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm not sure there'll be a wedding,
but I won't burden you with it.

331
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,640
Perhaps Mr Mosley could come on a
permanent basis, until I'm better.

332
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,660
I doubt that's a
solution, Mr Carson.

333
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:16,640
Neither my patience or his
liver could stand it.

334
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,240
Who is it?

335
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,120
I'm sorry, My Lord, we
never settled a time

336
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,680
you wanted to be woken.
Early, I think,

337
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,960
with everyone ill, seven.

338
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll breakfast at half past.

339
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,480
Very good, My Lord. Good night.

340
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
This isn't fair.

341
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,640
I'm placing you in an impossible
situation.

342
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,160
I want to be with you.

343
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,680
Let me.

344
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,240
I see.

345
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,960
You don't want me now. I want you
with every fiber of my being

346
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,960
but it isn't fair to you,
it isn't fair to anyone.

347
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,920
I wish I were different.
I wish everything was.

348
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,600
I don't want you different.

349
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,080
I like you the way you are.

350
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,720
Thank you for that.

351
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,200
I will cherish it.

352
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Truly.

353
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,500
What can I bring to help?

354
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:32,280
Ice, to bring her temperature down.
Mrs Hughes.

355
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,840
Sir Richard telephoned this morning.
He's coming down to help.

356
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,200
Can you have some rooms made ready
for him and his valet?

357
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,800
And tell Mrs Patmore.
Very good, m'lady.

358
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,760
'I don't accept I'm ruining her
life!'

359
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,760
Nor cutting her off from her family.
You cut her off, that's your decision!

360
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,040
How will you look after her?! How
can you hope to provide for her?

361
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,320
You seem to think she can only be happy
in some version of Downton Abbey.

362
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,800
If she wanted that life,
she would not be marrying me.

363
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,840
Very well.

364
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,600
I'd hoped to avoid this, but I see
that I can't!

365
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,800
How much will you take to leave us
in peace?

366
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,680
What?
You must have doubts.

367
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,480
You said your own mother thinks
you're foolish. Yes, she does.

368
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,960
Yield to those doubts and take enough
to make a new life back in Ireland.

369
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,240
I'll be generous if we can bring
this nonsense to an end. I see.

370
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,840
You know your trouble, My Lord?

371
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,160
You're like all of your kind, you think
you have the monopoly of honour!

372
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,000
Doesn't it occur to you
that I believe the best

373
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,800
guarantee of Sybil's
happiness lies with me?

374
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,160
Well, if you're not prepared
to listen to reason!

375
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,640
I'm not prepared to listen to insults.
Then, I'll bid you good day.

376
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,240
And I want you to leave the village.

377
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,880
Even though she'll come to me
the moment I call?

378
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,200
Do you really want me to leave now, when
I will take her with me that same hour?

379
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,520
There you are.
Dr Clarkson's here.

380
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,600
Cora's not at all well.
Sybil and Edith are with her.

381
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,560
Mary's gone to meet Sir Richard
from the train. Why's he coming?

382
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,240
He wants to be useful.
I don't see how. My Lord.

383
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,740
We're two more maids down.
I hope you forgive

384
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:44,200
some catch as catch can
in the days ahead.

385
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
Which maids? Not Jane?
No, My Lord. Not Jane.

386
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,520
Thank you.
What are they doing?

387
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,320
Decorations for the wedding.
It still hasn't been cancelled.

388
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,880
They have to prepare for it.

389
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,740
If Anna or Jane appear,
tell them to come

390
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:03,560
and help me do the
room for Sir Richard.

391
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,080
I can help with the bedroom then
I'll sort out a room for his man

392
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,680
and serve at dinner.
I can't pay you. Call it rent.

393
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,920
The awful truth is the wedding
simply cannot go ahead.

394
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,560
Don't say that.
I must.

395
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Dr Clarkson says you'll be groggy
for at least a week, maybe longer.

396
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,720
We have to face the facts.
What about my father?

397
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,960
Matthew can telephone him.
He can't come here while everyone's ill.

398
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,280
He has a weak chest, we mustn't
take the risk. All right.

399
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,640
I suppose we've made a decision,
then, to delay?

400
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,600
I don't think we've got any choice.
No. I'm afraid we don't.

401
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,000
At least she doesn't seem
too serious. No, no.

402
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,960
I'd say she's been lucky. I am
terribly sorry about the wedding.

403
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
These things are sent to try us.

404
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,760
Why didn't anyone tell
me she was like this?

405
00:28:57,761 --> 00:29:00,480
She took a turn for the
worse half an hour ago.

406
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,120
Where were you?
Out, I went for a walk.

407
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,160
There we are, m'lady, that's better,
isn't it?

408
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,900
She's been with her all night.

409
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,600
O'Brien, you must have a rest.
Not just now, My Lord.

410
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,540
I want to see her through
the worst, if I can.

411
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:24,440
I'll just make this
cooler for you.

412
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,800
How is she, really?
Tell me the truth.

413
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,520
I can't yet. Dr Clarkson says we
will know more in a few hours.

414
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,600
God almighty! How can this be?

415
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,480
My whole life gone over a cliff
in the course of a single day.

416
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:51,135
Take care of that, thank you.

417
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:54,735
How are you doing?
I'm not sure.

418
00:29:54,775 --> 00:29:57,335
Her ladyship's worse.
I'm sorry.

419
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:02,135
Jane said you wanted to see me.
I've done it. I've booked the registrar.

420
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:06,495
- When for?
- He's had a cancellation

421
00:30:06,535 --> 00:30:10,695
- so it's Friday afternoon.
- This Friday?

422
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:17,255
Ethel, what are you doing here?
The Bryants have turned up aga...

423
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:20,575
That's what.

424
00:30:20,615 --> 00:30:24,415
I'll find Mrs Hughes and come back
for you.

425
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,695
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
No, no.

426
00:30:33,735 --> 00:30:39,095
We have illness in the house so I hope
you'll excuse Lord and Lady Grantham.

427
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:43,375
It's not them we've come to see,
is it? Is she here?

428
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:45,695
She's just coming now.

429
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:55,495
May I meet him properly?

430
00:30:55,535 --> 00:30:59,095
Come along, Charlie.

431
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:02,335
This nice lady is your grandmother.

432
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:05,255
Perhaps you could call me, "Gran"?

433
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:07,935
He's a stout little chap, isn't he?

434
00:31:07,975 --> 00:31:11,375
And so like Charles. I thought it
when we were last here.

435
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:16,215
I know what was said at the time
and Mr Bryant's sorry for it now.

436
00:31:16,255 --> 00:31:19,175
But I could see he was just like
Charles.

437
00:31:19,215 --> 00:31:23,015
Never mind all that, let's get down
to business. Business?

438
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:25,915
That's what you want
from us, isn't it?

439
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,775
Find out what me mean to do for
little Charlie in the future?

440
00:31:31,415 --> 00:31:34,155
What do you mean, "She might die"?
What do you think

441
00:31:34,156 --> 00:31:36,895
happens with a fatal illness?
The fairies come?

442
00:31:36,935 --> 00:31:41,015
If anything happens to her, it
won't be your fault, Miss O'Brien.

443
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:43,335
I've never seen such care.

444
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:47,255
I wish I could talk to her, that's
all. But she doesn't know me.

445
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:51,375
I'm sure she knows how hard you've
worked for her. It's not that.

446
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:54,415
There's something I nee...

447
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:56,735
Never mind.

448
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:59,655
Either I will or I won't.

449
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,935
You never know people, do you.
You can work with

450
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:07,815
them for 20 years, you
don't know them at all.

451
00:32:07,855 --> 00:32:10,455
What? You mean give him up?

452
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:13,935
Never see him again?
Those are my terms.

453
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:19,695
But would it hurt if Ethel were
to care for him in your own house?

454
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:22,735
She could be his nurse.
That might be possible.

455
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:27,535
Of course she can't be his nurse.
We need to bring him up as a gentleman.

456
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:30,235
Send him to Harrow and
Oxford, and all the

457
00:32:30,236 --> 00:32:32,895
while his mother's in
the servant's hall.

458
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:34,855
How does that work? I could

459
00:32:34,856 --> 00:32:36,775
- No, we want to raise
his as our grandson,

460
00:32:36,815 --> 00:32:42,135
not as a housemaid's bastard!
Well, he has to know the truth sometime.

461
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:44,495
Maybe, but not for a long time.

462
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:47,195
Till then, his father had
a wartime marriage until

463
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:49,855
he died and his mother
succumbed to Spanish flu.

464
00:32:49,895 --> 00:32:53,855
A lot of people have.
We've quite a few upstairs.

465
00:32:53,895 --> 00:32:57,815
And that, for many years at least,
is all that Charlie will be told.

466
00:32:57,855 --> 00:33:00,415
So, I'm just to be written out?

467
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:03,195
Painted over? Buried?
What matters is what's

468
00:33:03,196 --> 00:33:05,935
good for Charlie.
And what's good for you!

469
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:11,215
You've got a heart, I know you have.
You see what he's asking?

470
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:15,495
Ethel, consider this. In the world
as it is, compare the two futures.

471
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,135
The first, as my heir.
Educated, privileged, rich.

472
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:22,295
Able to do what he wants,
marry whom he likes.

473
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,235
The second, as the bastard son

474
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,135
- I think we've heard enough of
that word for one day. Very well.

475
00:33:28,175 --> 00:33:32,335
As the nameless offshoot
of a drudge,

476
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,815
you're his mother.

477
00:33:34,855 --> 00:33:37,455
Which would you choose for him?

478
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:45,775
Suppose I could be his nurse and never
tell him who I am. I promise that.

479
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,815
Surely ... Come on! We all know that's
a promise you could never keep.

480
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:52,315
I'm sorry,
Mrs Hughes, we need the

481
00:33:52,316 --> 00:33:54,775
doctor at once.
Her ladyship's much worse.

482
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:58,895
I'm afraid ... Go where you're needed,
we've had our say.

483
00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:02,655
You know how to reach us
when you've made your decision.

484
00:34:02,695 --> 00:34:05,775
Come along, Daphne.

485
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:19,615
O'Brien?

486
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:21,935
Is that you, O'Brien?

487
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:25,095
Yes, m'lady, it's me, m'lady.

488
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:29,175
You're so good to me.

489
00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,735
You've always been so good.

490
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:36,935
Not always, m'lady.
So good.

491
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:39,775
No.

492
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:44,975
And the fact is, I want to ask
so much for your forgiveness.

493
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:51,015
Because I did something once
which I bitterly regret. Bitterly.

494
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:55,175
And if you could only know
how much ... So very good.

495
00:35:04,295 --> 00:35:07,535
How is she?
She slept and she seemed better.

496
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:10,575
Then suddenly the fever came back.

497
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:17,455
O'Brien, thank you for the way
you've looked after her. I mean it.

498
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:20,495
I'm very grateful, whatever comes.

499
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,575
What a marathon, but I think I got
them all.

500
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:34,375
Everyone sends love. I told your
father I'll telegraph him

501
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:38,295
as soon as it's safe for him
to come. But not before.

502
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:42,455
Well, I don't think I should
leave you alone.

503
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:45,135
But if you don't tell.

504
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:54,015
I've been thinking about
the date for the rematch and...

505
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:57,535
What is it?

506
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:01,135
I wonder if we haven't been rather
lucky.

507
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:04,175
Why, I think we've both been very
lucky.

508
00:36:04,215 --> 00:36:09,135
That we've been given a second
chance. A second chance at what?

509
00:36:10,575 --> 00:36:13,935
To be quite, quite sure about
what we're doing.

510
00:36:15,975 --> 00:36:19,335
Darling, what can you mean?
The thing is, ...

511
00:36:20,775 --> 00:36:22,775
I might as well say it.

512
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:29,175
When I came downstairs and you
and Mary were dancing, ...

513
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:33,295
I heard what you said.

514
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:38,815
And I saw what you did. That was ...
No, I'm not in a rage, in a fury,

515
00:36:38,855 --> 00:36:41,655
in fact, I think it's
noble of you to want

516
00:36:41,656 --> 00:36:44,455
to keep your word when
things have changed.

517
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:48,255
But I'm not sure it would be right
for me to hold you to it.

518
00:36:48,295 --> 00:36:51,495
Lavinia, I can explain.
No, listen.

519
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:54,655
I've had lots of time to think about
it.

520
00:36:56,655 --> 00:36:59,055
I love you very, very much.

521
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,415
And I've wanted to
marry you from the

522
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:06,135
first moment I saw you.
All that is true.

523
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:09,615
But I didn't really know what I was
taking on.

524
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:13,415
It's not in me to be
queen of the county.

525
00:37:13,455 --> 00:37:17,215
I'm a little person, an ordinary
person

526
00:37:17,255 --> 00:37:20,375
and when I saw you and Mary
together, I thought,

527
00:37:20,415 --> 00:37:24,975
how fine, how right you looked
together.

528
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:28,175
I don't want to hear this!
You must!

529
00:37:29,735 --> 00:37:32,455
Because it isn't a sudden thing.

530
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:37,375
I was starting to worry and then,
when you were wounded,

531
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:40,975
I thought it was my calling
to look after you.

532
00:37:41,015 --> 00:37:43,055
And care for you.

533
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,675
And I don't think
Mary would have done

534
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:50,095
that quite as well as me, really.
No, no.

535
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,855
Not nearly as well.

536
00:37:55,335 --> 00:37:57,615
I do have some self worth.

537
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:02,315
Just not enough to make you
marry the wrong person.

538
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:05,215
This is pointless, Mary is
marrying somebody else.

539
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,935
Is she?

540
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,975
We'll see.

541
00:38:11,015 --> 00:38:14,695
I won't let you do this.
You will.

542
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:21,975
We won't fight about it now.

543
00:38:23,775 --> 00:38:27,175
In fact, I'm tired.
Can I rest for a bit?

544
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:31,375
We'll talk later.
Of course.

545
00:38:50,735 --> 00:38:55,135
It's good of you to come but I don't
really see what you can do.

546
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:57,835
I thought I'd better do my bit.

547
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,495
The chauffer's gone so
I could drive the car.

548
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:03,255
Preferably over the chauffer.

549
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:06,335
Father's not having an easy time
of it.

550
00:39:07,655 --> 00:39:10,495
How's Lady Grantham?
Not well.

551
00:39:10,535 --> 00:39:13,095
Clarkson's with her now.

552
00:39:13,135 --> 00:39:16,375
And Miss Swire?
She's...

553
00:39:19,575 --> 00:39:24,375
Is that why you've come? Because
I said Lavinia had been taken ill?

554
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:28,215
I was coming up anyway,
in a day or two, for the wedding.

555
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,775
Well, she won't be getting married
on Saturday.

556
00:39:30,815 --> 00:39:33,575
Which I suppose is what you'd like
best?

557
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:36,775
But she's not seriously ill.

558
00:39:38,015 --> 00:39:40,495
I see what was worrying you.

559
00:39:40,535 --> 00:39:43,415
If Lavinia had been carried
off, you wanted to be

560
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,295
here to stop Matthew from
falling into my arms

561
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:50,415
on a tidal wave of grief.
It's a tricky disease.

562
00:39:55,295 --> 00:39:58,495
His lordship's asking for you,
m'lady.

563
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:06,935
I think we should aim at a sort
of buffet dinner.

564
00:40:06,975 --> 00:40:09,275
Then they can run in and
out as it suits them.

565
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,575
Sorry to make extra work.

566
00:40:11,615 --> 00:40:14,255
Never mind, it's hours like these
we must all pull together.

567
00:40:14,256 --> 00:40:16,895
This arrived in the post, Daisy.

568
00:40:16,935 --> 00:40:19,695
- Tea for Sir Richard
in the drawing room.

569
00:40:19,696 --> 00:40:22,455
- I'm glad to know
he's here to help

570
00:40:22,495 --> 00:40:25,895
I can do it.
You're very obliging, Thomas.

571
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:29,935
I can take some up to Mr Carson,
if you'd like?

572
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:35,095
Is that from your Mr Mason?
He's not mine.

573
00:40:35,135 --> 00:40:40,415
What does he say? He just says,
again, we should talk about William.

574
00:40:40,455 --> 00:40:43,135
He wants me to go to his farm.
Poor man.

575
00:40:43,136 --> 00:40:45,815
Will you not visit him?
I'm not going to any farm!

576
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:48,795
You're all he's got, Daisy.

577
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:51,735
Well, then, he's got nobody
cos he hasn't got me.

578
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:00,975
I'm sorry, m'lady, I didn't
think you'd want to change tonight.

579
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:04,055
I don't. I just need a handkerchief.

580
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,335
How's her ladyship?
Not good, I'm afraid.

581
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:13,815
What is it?
I don't mean to bother you, m'lady.

582
00:41:13,855 --> 00:41:16,735
Go on.
Can you keep a secret?

583
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:19,135
Well, I know you can.

584
00:41:19,175 --> 00:41:22,095
You see, Mr Bates and I had a plan.

585
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:27,255
To get married this coming Friday.
What?

586
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:31,295
He's worried the police haven't
finished with him and, if he's right,

587
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,715
then, I'm not going
through it with no

588
00:41:33,716 --> 00:41:36,095
proper place in his life.
A brave decision.

589
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:40,175
Or a stupid one.
Anyway, with her ladyship ill now

590
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:42,555
and half the servants on their
backs and everybody working

591
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:44,895
- Where is the marriage to be?

592
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,895
Just in a register office in Ripon.

593
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:52,775
It wouldn't take long but... Go.
I'll cover for you. We're all here.

594
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:55,975
You won't help mama by changing your
plans.

595
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,935
You better come. She's worse.

596
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:04,815
I've given her the epinephrine.
Doctor! No!

597
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,255
What does that mean?

598
00:42:07,295 --> 00:42:10,535
It's a hemorrhage of the mucus
membranes.

599
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:12,695
It's not unusual.

600
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:18,895
It's all right, m'lady, don't worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

601
00:42:18,935 --> 00:42:23,175
Everything is clearly not all right.
How bad is it?

602
00:42:23,215 --> 00:42:27,015
If she lasts through the night,
she'll life.

603
00:42:29,455 --> 00:42:31,455
What about the others?

604
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:33,855
Come with me.

605
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,775
I'll be back shortly.

606
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:42,375
I've given some medicine
to Mrs Hughes.

607
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:46,375
She'll bring it up later. I gather
her ladyship is not improving.

608
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:50,295
We'll, er, we'll know more tomorrow.
And Miss Swire?

609
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:53,195
Not too bad, I think.
I'll go to her when I've

610
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:56,055
seem the rest of the servants.

611
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:02,175
Thank you, sir. Here we are,
Mr Carson.

612
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:05,455
Now, have you got everything
you need?

613
00:43:06,895 --> 00:43:09,255
M'lady.

614
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:17,055
I want to thank you for coming up,
m'lady. Not at all.

615
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:22,255
I mean it. I know I've been
a disappointment to you.

616
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:24,335
Maybe.

617
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:30,215
But I've relied on your support for
too long to do without it entirely.

618
00:43:30,255 --> 00:43:33,975
You'll always have my support,
m'lady. And you, mine.

619
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,655
On which subject...

620
00:43:37,695 --> 00:43:40,015
I should be careful of Thomas.

621
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:45,375
I don't know how we're to get
rid of him after all this.

622
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:50,255
I doubt he'll want to stay a footman
forever, so, watch out.

623
00:44:01,015 --> 00:44:05,135
You look very smart, Thomas.
I still have the shirt, m'lady.

624
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,935
And I found my livery in the
cupboard so I thought, "Why not?"

625
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,535
I have a place for you here.

626
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:22,695
How's Lavinia?
All right, I think.

627
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:27,535
The illness has made her rather
confused. What do you mean?

628
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:30,175
Matthew! Mary!

629
00:44:30,215 --> 00:44:33,295
Is it mama?

630
00:44:33,335 --> 00:44:35,975
That's what's so... It's Lavinia.

631
00:44:42,135 --> 00:44:46,935
Let him go to her. Let him be with
her. Surely you owe her that?

632
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:52,535
What happened?
This is how I found her.

633
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:55,055
It's bad, I'm afraid.

634
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:57,215
Very bad.

635
00:44:59,055 --> 00:45:03,575
The worst. I don't understand.
When I was with her, she was fine.

636
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:08,455
It's a strange disease with sudden,
savage changes.

637
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:15,415
I'm terribly sorry. What can I do?
Can I talk to her? Yes. Of course.

638
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:21,855
My darling. Can you hear me?

639
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,135
It's me. It's Matthew.

640
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:26,695
Matthew.

641
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:33,135
I'm so glad you're here.
Of course I'm here.

642
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:35,175
Darling, where else would I be?

643
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,655
Isn't this better?

644
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,535
Really?
I don't understand you.

645
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:49,015
You have to make our decision.

646
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:55,575
Be happy.

647
00:45:55,615 --> 00:45:57,895
For my sake.

648
00:46:00,015 --> 00:46:03,375
Promise me.

649
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:08,215
It's all I want for you.

650
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,455
Remember that.

651
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:23,535
That's what I want.

652
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,855
But I can't be happy.

653
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:29,975
Not without you.
How could I be happy?

654
00:47:34,305 --> 00:47:36,625
What are you doing?

655
00:47:36,665 --> 00:47:39,665
They were put up for the wedding,
Mr Crawley.

656
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:42,105
My dear chap.

657
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:45,345
I cannot find the words to say how
sorry I am.

658
00:47:46,785 --> 00:47:48,785
How is cousin Cora?

659
00:47:50,305 --> 00:47:52,785
Much better, thank you.

660
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:55,105
Glad to hear it.

661
00:47:55,145 --> 00:47:57,345
I came to see if there's
anything I can do.

662
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,545
We've taken care of all that.

663
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:03,105
We always use Grassby's. Of course.
Travis suggested Monday for the

664
00:48:03,145 --> 00:48:07,585
funeral to give people time to get
here. It will be in tomorrow's paper.

665
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:10,065
That's very kind of you.

666
00:48:10,105 --> 00:48:13,545
Mary wanted to see you.
No!

667
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:15,585
I mean, I...

668
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:18,485
don't really want to see anyone.
Not yet.

669
00:48:18,486 --> 00:48:21,345
Now I know everything's
settled, I'll go back.

670
00:48:21,385 --> 00:48:25,305
When you speak to her father,
do ask him to stay here.

671
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:27,505
Thank you.

672
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:29,945
He'll be very grateful.

673
00:48:29,985 --> 00:48:33,705
Just tell me what you want me to do
and I'll do it.

674
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:47,345
Are you feeling more yourself?

675
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:49,505
A bit.

676
00:48:49,545 --> 00:48:52,465
I still can't get over it.

677
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:56,385
I hope you'll not pretend you liked
her now.

678
00:48:56,425 --> 00:49:00,185
I didn't want her here,
Mrs Hughes, I'll admit.

679
00:49:00,225 --> 00:49:05,185
But I had no objection to her being
happy somewhere else.

680
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:07,865
A sight to gladden my heart.

681
00:49:07,905 --> 00:49:10,585
Is it? I hope it is.

682
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:15,345
You gave us quite a fright.
They told me about Lavinia.

683
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:19,465
The funeral is on Monday.

684
00:49:19,505 --> 00:49:21,825
I'd like to go, if I can.

685
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:35,665
We're all right,

686
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:38,265
aren't we, Robert?

687
00:49:39,905 --> 00:49:42,025
Of course we are.

688
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:46,005
I got so caught up in
everything, I think

689
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:48,985
I neglected you and
if I did, I'm sorry.

690
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:51,665
Don't apologise to me.

691
00:50:00,025 --> 00:50:02,225
Ethel!

692
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:05,625
Whatever are you doing here at this
time of night?

693
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:09,805
I said I'd be back with
my answer and here I am.

694
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:12,425
You know we're a
house in mourning?

695
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:15,305
Yes and I'm sorry.

696
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:20,465
But, if anything, it's made my mind
up for me.

697
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:24,585
Life is short and what's my life
without Charlie?

698
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:30,105
They're not having him.
As long as you're sure.

699
00:50:30,145 --> 00:50:32,685
They say they can do
better for him but what's

700
00:50:32,686 --> 00:50:35,225
better than his mother's love?
Answer me that.

701
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,465
I'll write and tell them.

702
00:50:39,905 --> 00:50:43,185
You agree with me, though, don't
you?

703
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:45,745
My opinion has no place in this.

704
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:11,825
'I, John Bates.'
'I, John Bates.'

705
00:51:11,865 --> 00:51:15,945
'Take thee, Anna May Smith.'
'Take thee, Anna May Smith.'

706
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:19,225
'To be my wedded wife.'
'To be my wedded wife.'

707
00:51:19,265 --> 00:51:23,545
'I, Anna May Smith.'
I, Anna May Smith.

708
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:27,265
Take thee, John Bates.
Take thee, John Bates.

709
00:51:27,305 --> 00:51:30,745
To be my wedded husband.
To be my wedded husband.

710
00:51:30,785 --> 00:51:33,225
And now the ring.

711
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:42,225
With this ring I plight thee
my troth.

712
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:46,305
With this ring I plight thee
my troth.

713
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:50,545
As a symbol of all we have promised.
As a symbol of all we have promised.

714
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:54,185
And all that we share.
And all that we share.

715
00:51:57,305 --> 00:51:59,745
It therefore gives me great pleasure

716
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:03,225
to say you are now husband and wife
together.

717
00:52:23,465 --> 00:52:25,545
You rang, My Lord?

718
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:31,905
I keep forgetting Carson's ill.
Mrs Hughes says he's much better.

719
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:34,865
I really want Bates. He'd gone out.
He's in your dressing room.

720
00:52:34,866 --> 00:52:37,785
He went up with
your evening shirt.

721
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:40,305
Golly, is that the time?

722
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:44,465
Actually, can you stay a moment?

723
00:52:44,505 --> 00:52:49,065
I was trying to think how to contrive
a meeting and here you are.

724
00:52:51,305 --> 00:52:53,905
You see ...
I'm glad Lady Grantham's better.

725
00:52:53,945 --> 00:52:56,825
Truly.

726
00:52:56,865 --> 00:52:59,105
And don't worry.

727
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:02,145
There's no harm done.

728
00:53:03,345 --> 00:53:05,345
No harm done yet.

729
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:10,065
I'm almost packed.

730
00:53:10,105 --> 00:53:13,305
And I've given in my notice.

731
00:53:42,025 --> 00:53:45,905
This is the name and address
of my man of business.

732
00:53:48,665 --> 00:53:50,665
Why?

733
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:53,505
You don't owe me anything.

734
00:53:53,545 --> 00:53:56,585
It's not for you.

735
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:59,345
It's for Freddie.

736
00:53:59,385 --> 00:54:01,985
Let me give him a start in life.

737
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:07,705
I'm not sure ...
It would make me very happy.

738
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:11,625
If I thought that, then I'd take it,
gladly.

739
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:16,145
Will you be happy?

740
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:18,385
Really?

741
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:23,345
I have no right to be unhappy,
which is almost the same.

742
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,385
Almost.

743
00:54:29,465 --> 00:54:31,705
Not quite.

744
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,665
Can I kiss you before I go?

745
00:55:16,985 --> 00:55:19,545
The secret Mrs Bates.

746
00:55:19,585 --> 00:55:22,545
We will tell everyone but I thought
we should leave it a while.

747
00:55:22,546 --> 00:55:25,505
At least till after
the funeral, anyway.

748
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:29,545
You'll have to control yourselves.
Well, we've had enough practise.

749
00:55:36,025 --> 00:55:38,305
Come with me.

750
00:56:02,185 --> 00:56:05,345
Smuggle Bates in here
when everyone has gone to bed.

751
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:08,905
And for heaven's sake,
make sure he gets the right room.

752
00:56:08,945 --> 00:56:12,225
I don't know what to say, m'lady.

753
00:56:12,265 --> 00:56:14,985
Who did all this?
Jane.

754
00:56:15,025 --> 00:56:18,345
I told her. She said it would be her
leaving present.

755
00:56:18,385 --> 00:56:21,665
You can stay all night.
She won't tell.

756
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:24,505
M'lady, thank you.

757
00:56:24,545 --> 00:56:27,425
Very, very much.

758
00:56:30,145 --> 00:56:33,105
Are you sure you should be up,
Mr Carson?

759
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:36,545
I wanted to check the silver before
tomorrow.

760
00:56:36,585 --> 00:56:40,225
I think I've cleaned all the pieces
we might need.

761
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:44,785
We'll get everything ready
the moment breakfast is over.

762
00:56:44,825 --> 00:56:48,505
Thank you for the way you've kept it
all going, Thomas.

763
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:51,465
I wish I knew how to express
my gratitude.

764
00:56:51,505 --> 00:56:54,265
You'll find a way, Mr Carson.

765
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,905
I think that's everything we owe.

766
00:57:06,945 --> 00:57:10,985
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.
I'm sorry you're going, Jane.

767
00:57:11,025 --> 00:57:14,145
You're a good worker.
I wish you well.

768
00:57:14,185 --> 00:57:16,825
I'm sorry, too, Mrs Hughes.

769
00:57:16,865 --> 00:57:20,545
But in the end I think it's for the
best.

770
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:22,785
For everyone.

771
00:57:22,825 --> 00:57:27,185
When all is said and done, my dear,
you may be right.

772
00:57:41,585 --> 00:57:45,505
Well, ... Mrs Bates?

773
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:51,425
You've had your way with me.

774
00:57:56,985 --> 00:58:00,265
I just hope you don't live to regret
it.

775
00:58:02,305 --> 00:58:04,665
I couldn't regret it.

776
00:58:04,705 --> 00:58:07,225
No matter what comes.

777
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:13,505
I know only that I am now
who I was meant to be.

778
00:58:18,545 --> 00:58:21,385
I'm not worthy of you,
that's all I know.

779
00:58:23,425 --> 00:58:27,145
And they'll call me names
for pulling you into my troubles.

780
00:58:30,545 --> 00:58:33,265
Mr Bates.

781
00:58:33,305 --> 00:58:37,625
We've waited long enough to be
together, you and I.

782
00:58:37,665 --> 00:58:39,865
And now that we're man and wife,

783
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:43,265
can that not be enough,
just for this one night?

784
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:09,685
Earth to earth,

785
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:11,725
ashes to ashes,

786
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:14,645
dust to dust.

787
00:59:16,885 --> 00:59:20,365
In sure and in certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life

788
00:59:20,405 --> 00:59:22,845
through our lord, Jesus Christ,

789
00:59:22,885 --> 00:59:28,405
we shall change our vile body that it
may be like unto his glorious body,

790
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:30,925
according to the mighty working

791
00:59:30,965 --> 00:59:35,885
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

792
00:59:35,925 --> 00:59:37,925
Amen.

793
00:59:37,965 --> 00:59:39,805
Amen.

794
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:48,485
Would you give him a moment?
Of course, ma'am, I understand.

795
00:59:57,765 --> 01:00:01,605
We better get moving if we're
to be back before they arrive.

796
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:06,045
Mrs Patmore and Thomas will go ahead
in the trap. They'll sort it out.

797
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:09,285
I've no doubt Thomas
will have everything sorted out.

798
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:13,485
I'm sorry but it's no good thinking
we'll get shot of him now.

799
01:00:13,525 --> 01:00:16,405
Why doesn't that come as a surprise?

800
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:34,725
I've been hoping I might meet you
here one day.

801
01:00:36,125 --> 01:00:39,765
I expect you'll come as often
as I try to do?

802
01:00:39,805 --> 01:00:42,525
It was a funeral...

803
01:00:42,565 --> 01:00:45,765
of a lady that was going to marry
Mr Crawley.

804
01:00:45,805 --> 01:00:48,285
I heard about that.

805
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:52,365
There's nothing so wrong as when
young folks die.

806
01:00:55,925 --> 01:00:59,285
Nay, needn't hide your tears from
me, love.

807
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:06,565
It does me good to see how much you
loved him, it does.

808
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:14,645
You must tell me if there's anything
I can do.

809
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:17,445
Anything at all.
Thank you.

810
01:01:17,485 --> 01:01:19,765
But I don't think so.

811
01:01:24,325 --> 01:01:26,925
That night when we were dancing.

812
01:01:26,965 --> 01:01:29,565
Lavinia came downstairs.

813
01:01:31,565 --> 01:01:34,205
She heard, she...

814
01:01:35,245 --> 01:01:38,885
She saw everything.

815
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:41,645
How terrible for her.

816
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:46,125
I'm so sorry.
Because of what she saw,

817
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:49,325
she thought we should cancel
the wedding.

818
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:54,085
That I belonged with you.

819
01:01:54,125 --> 01:01:56,285
Not with her.

820
01:01:59,085 --> 01:02:03,565
She gave up because of us.
She said tome when she was dying,

821
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:06,085
"Isn't this better?"

822
01:02:08,765 --> 01:02:11,325
I know it's a cliche but...

823
01:02:12,725 --> 01:02:16,445
I believe she died of a broken
heart because of that kiss.

824
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:20,485
We were the ones who killed her.

825
01:02:20,525 --> 01:02:24,685
Matthew. I could never be happy
now. Don't you see?

826
01:02:24,725 --> 01:02:27,685
We're cursed, you and I.

827
01:02:27,725 --> 01:02:30,805
And there's nothing to be done
about it.

828
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:35,045
Let's be strong, Mary.

829
01:02:36,045 --> 01:02:39,565
Let's accept that this is the end.

830
01:02:41,765 --> 01:02:43,805
Of course it's the end.

831
01:02:45,685 --> 01:02:48,165
How could it not be?

832
01:02:52,925 --> 01:02:55,805
I'm so very sorry about this.

833
01:02:58,205 --> 01:03:00,325
Thank you.

834
01:03:00,365 --> 01:03:04,685
Can I walk you up to the house
or...? Certainly, you can.

835
01:03:04,725 --> 01:03:07,645
I want you to.

836
01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:26,925
So sad.

837
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:33,205
Why are you here? To pay my respects
to Miss Swire. And to see Sybil.

838
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:36,685
Lady Sybil! Papa, what's the point
in all that nonsense?

839
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:42,045
I suppose you'll go to Dublin now,
isn't that your plan? In a day or two.

840
01:03:42,085 --> 01:03:46,325
Mama is well again and I see no
reason to delay.

841
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:50,365
Although, I do so wish
we could have parted friends.

842
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:54,765
What about you?
Do you want to part friends?

843
01:03:54,805 --> 01:03:58,405
I do. Although I don't expect to.

844
01:04:01,245 --> 01:04:03,285
All right.

845
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:07,245
What?

846
01:04:07,285 --> 01:04:11,045
Well, if I can't stop you,
I see no profit in a quarrel.

847
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:15,525
You'll have a very different life
from the one you might have lived,

848
01:04:15,565 --> 01:04:18,325
but if you're sure it's what you
want?

849
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:20,405
I am.

850
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:24,845
Then you may take my blessing
with you, whatever that means.

851
01:04:24,885 --> 01:04:29,725
Papa! It means more than
anything! More than anything!

852
01:04:33,285 --> 01:04:38,765
If you mistreat her, I will personally
have you torn to pieces by wild dogs.

853
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:40,845
I'd expect no less.

854
01:04:40,885 --> 01:04:44,605
Will you come over for the wedding?
We'll talk about that later.

855
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:48,205
And there'll be some money.
But not much.

856
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:06,325
So, you've given in?

857
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:10,405
She would have gone anyway.

858
01:05:10,445 --> 01:05:14,165
And perhaps we should let Lavinia's
last gift to us

859
01:05:14,205 --> 01:05:17,005
be a reminder of what really matters.

860
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:20,245
You'll think that's soft?
Not at all.

861
01:05:20,285 --> 01:05:24,165
The aristocracy has not survived
by its intransigence.

862
01:05:24,205 --> 01:05:28,565
No, we must work with what
we've got to minimise the scandal.

863
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,805
But what have we got to work with?

864
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:34,445
You'd be surprised.
He's political, isn't he?

865
01:05:34,485 --> 01:05:36,725
And a writer.

866
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:39,205
I could make something out of that.

867
01:05:39,245 --> 01:05:42,605
And there's a family called Branson

868
01:05:42,645 --> 01:05:45,285
with a place not far from Cork.

869
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:48,305
I believe they have a
connection with the Howards.

870
01:05:48,306 --> 01:05:51,285
Surely we can hitch
him onto them?

871
01:05:56,325 --> 01:05:59,845
Mr Bates! You all right,
Mrs Patmore? I'm all right.

872
01:06:00,845 --> 01:06:05,005
There are two men waiting for you
in the servants hall.

873
01:06:21,365 --> 01:06:23,925
Are you looking for me?
John Bates?

874
01:06:23,965 --> 01:06:27,925
Yes. You are under arrest
on the charge of willful murder.

875
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:31,485
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you desire to do so.

876
01:06:31,525 --> 01:06:34,225
Whatever you say will be
taken down in writing and

877
01:06:34,226 --> 01:06:36,925
may be given in evidence
against you upon trial.

878
01:06:36,965 --> 01:06:39,125
I understand.

879
01:06:39,165 --> 01:06:42,925
No! No!
Please, ... do whatever is required.

880
01:06:45,165 --> 01:06:48,285
I love you.
And I love you.

881
01:06:48,325 --> 01:06:52,605
For richer, for poorer.
For better, for worse. Come along, sir.

882
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:43,845

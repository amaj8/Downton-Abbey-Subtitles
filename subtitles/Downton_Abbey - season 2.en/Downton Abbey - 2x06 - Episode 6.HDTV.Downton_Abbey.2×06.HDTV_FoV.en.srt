1
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,280
I shall have arms like Jack Johnson
if I'm not careful.

2
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm strong enough to wheel myself.

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
I'll be the judge of that.

4
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
Morning.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I keep thinking about William.

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,040
How he should be here...

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,520
not exactly instead of me,

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,000
but sacrifice should be rewarded.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
He was the brave one.

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,080
You were both brave.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,800
I don't think we can say 'should'
about things that happen in war.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,240
It just happens
and we should live with it.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Ought I to be jealous?

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm sorry,
what were we talking about?

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,840
I was asking about Haxby Park. I'm
taking Mary over there tomorrow.

16
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,160
Our Haxby Park?
Why? Are the Russells selling?

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,000
Not officially, but I am told
they're open to offers.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,960
Sad. The Russells and the Crawleys
have been neighbours for centuries.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,080
They're not living there any more.
It'll be strange for Mary.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,240
She's been going to that house since
she was a girl in a party dress.

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,080
We all have. There's nowhere better
near Downton.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not sure how comfortable it is.

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
It'll be comfortable
when I'm finished with it.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,280
Central heating, modern kitchens,

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,800
bathrooms with every bedroom,
it's all possible.

26
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Sounds more like an hotel.

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Major Clarkson.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Good morning, Lord Grantham.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,160
Lady Edith. Sir.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
We've had a request.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,080
A Canadian Major has asked
to come here

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
because of a family link
with the house.

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,480
We've taken officers
from his regiment before,

34
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,560
but I wanted to be sure
you'd no objection.

35
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
What's his name? Gordon.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,360
Patrick Gordon.

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,080
He was with Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry at Passchendaele.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
Caught in a blast and burned,
rather badly, I believe.

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,560
Poor fellow.
Well, he's perfectly welcome.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm not aware of how we are
connected, but you never know.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,760
Sir.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,240
I've never worked in a house where
a valet and a housemaid were wed.

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,080
It'll be unusual, I agree.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,760
I hope it doesn't break us up.

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,640
Having you two set apart
in a home of your own, all special,

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,920
while the rest of us
muddle on for ourselves.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
You sound as if you're jealous.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,440
I'm not jealous. I just
don't want it to spoil things.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,560
Why, because we've all been
such pals until now

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Give her time.

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
Matthew's making such progress.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
I think so,
but are we doing enough for him,

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,800
for all of them,
when it comes to rehabilitation?

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,160
They're going to have to face a
very different world after the war.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,760
I agree, but they'll all
be leaving Downton soon.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,880
Leaving?
Well, Turkey's about to capitulate

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,760
and Robert says
Vittorio Veneto will finish Austria,

58
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,960
so it's only a matter of weeks,
even days, before it's over.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,880
We wouldn't send anyone home
too soon, of course,

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,880
but some time in the new year,
we will have our house back.

61
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,400
So you want it just to be
a private house again?

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,240
Shouldn't she?

63
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Or would you like to abolish
private houses?

64
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,840
Well, that life of changing clothes
and killing things and eating them,

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,480
do you really want it again?

66
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,640
Wouldn't you rather Downton
was useful? The house is useful.

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,800
We provide employment. Please...

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,960
Let me look into keeping it open
as a centre of recovery.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,320
I could run it. The house could be
so much more than it was before.

70
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,960
What about you, Molesley?

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Are you looking forward to

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,560
this brave new world of
Mrs Crawley's imaginings?

73
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm glad of my job, m'lady,

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
and I should very much like
to hold onto it,

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
with Mrs Crawley's permission.

76
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,080
Servants are always far more
conservative than their employers.

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Everyone knows that.

78
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Then I must be
the exception that proves the rule.

79
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
Hello.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
My name's Edith Craw...

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,880
Lady Edith Crawley, I know.

82
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Second daughter of the house.

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,680
In charge of non-medical welfare.

84
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,040
So whatever you need, in the way
of errands run or books to read,

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,880
then I'm your man.

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,520
Thank you.

87
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,680
I hope this doesn't put you off.

88
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,240
I can assure you, at this stage,
there isn't much that puts me off.

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Did they tell you we're related?

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Yes, but I'm afraid
I'm not much good at family history.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,840
Although Papa's found an aunt
in 1860 who married a Gordon.

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Perhaps that's a clue.

93
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,840
No, that isn't it.

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,320
Well, as I say, I'm hopeless.

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
I-I thought
you'd recognise my voice

96
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,800
but, of course,
I sound Canadian now.

97
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
You mean we've met before?

98
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
It was a long time ago.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,080
Edith, I need you.

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,640
It just explains
what you're entitled to.

101
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,920
That's kind but, let's face it,
I'm not a widow, am I? Not really.

102
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
Of course you are. No I'm not.

103
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,400
How long was I married?
Six hours? Seven?

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,760
I shouldn't have taken his name,
except it were what he wanted.

105
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Well, I'll leave it wi' you.

106
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,440
Daisy?

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,800
It wouldn't please William
if you don't take what's owing.

108
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,680
He wanted you to be looked after.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,480
No. You made me a liar
while he was alive.

110
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,760
You'll not make me be false to
his memory.

111
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,200
You can leave me, Brooks.
Yes, sir.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,360
Mr Bates said you wanted to see me,
sir.

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Yes.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,080
I asked you up here,
because I want to offer you a job.

115
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
I have a job, sir.

116
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, of course you do,
I'm sure you enjoy it.

117
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,840
I don't mean to suggest
I'm offering a better one.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you.

119
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,360
Although it would mean
a considerable increase in salary.

120
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,160
Lady Mary and I intend
to buy a home near Downton.

121
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
It's a long way from London,

122
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,680
but I've made enough money
to please myself, these days.

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,040
I know she holds you in high regard.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,000
I believe she would very much
appreciate your help

125
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,520
when she first sets up house
as a bride.

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,680
You mean you wish me to leave
Downton Abbey and transfer...

127
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,920
Tomorrow, we go to see Haxby Park.

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,200
If we buy it, we'll take on
the whole 12,000 acres.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,640
No doubt you will discover
many interesting walks to enjoy.

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,320
Of course it's run down,

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,120
but there's nothing wrong with it
that money can't fix.

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,000
So... what do you think?

133
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
One thing I must ask.

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,480
Is Lady Mary aware
that you have approached me?

135
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,520
Not yet.

136
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,800
I wanted to surprise her.

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
She thinks highly of you, Carson.

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,160
I hope I won't be taking on a rival.

139
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
I await Lady Mary's instruction.

140
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't dislike him, I just don't
like him, which is quite different.

141
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Did he talk about Haxby?

142
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,960
He's got ghastly plans for the place.
Of course, Cora doesn't agree.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,520
I'm an American. I don't share
your English hatred of comfort.

144
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,000
Downton's comfortable enough for me.
I can't wait to have it back.

145
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,480
That's if Cousin Isabelle allows it.

146
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,400
She turned up today with
a hideous list of projects

147
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
that stretched to 1920 and beyond.

148
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,720
Surely you can put her off.

149
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,320
I don't know how,
once the bit's between her teeth.

150
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,960
Well, change the bridle.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,240
Find a cause that needs her
more than Downton.

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,880
She's such a martyr.

153
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Then we must tempt her
with a more enticing scaffold.

154
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
We're safe.
We've got the Decree Nisi.

155
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
I'm sure it's all right.

156
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,400
Except you're not sure.

157
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,280
Not sure about what?

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,720
What about you, Sergeant? Have you
started planning for after the war?

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
Not really, not yet.

160
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
I know what you should be doing.

161
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,160
I know what we should all be doing.

162
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,480
Yeah? What's that?

163
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Hoarding.

164
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,280
It may be wrong, but
this rationing is starting to bite.

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,120
Even with everyone's books,

166
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,600
I had a battle to get enough sugar
for this week.

167
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,840
Are you suggesting the black market,
Mrs Patmore?

168
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm shocked.

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,840
I doubt that very much.

170
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm sorry I couldn't get down this
week, but we've had a house full.

171
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,920
Who's looking after the baby?
My neighbour.

172
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
She's lent me her bike,
so I can get back.

173
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Well, you'd best be off.

174
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
I can't, darling,
I've got too much work.

175
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,920
We're losing two of the nurses
and they must rearrange the roster.

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,560
If Mary's out with Carlisle

177
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
and Edith's going to Mama's,
I'll be on my own.

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,240
What about Sybil?
Sybil's on duty.

179
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,240
I wish you'd told me. I could've
fixed something up for myself.

180
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,640
You could always
ask Major Clarkson to join you,

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,200
if you really can't be on your own
for one luncheon. I'll manage.

182
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
It's so empty.

183
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
I didn't know they'd gone.

184
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,360
They've given up.

185
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
You can't blame them.

186
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,880
When Billy was killed, it knocked
the stuffing out of them completely.

187
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,880
What'll we do about furniture
and pictures and everything?

188
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,640
What does anyone do?

189
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
Buy it, I presume.

190
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,840
Your lot buys it,
my lot inherits it.

191
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
We ought to be getting back.

192
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Why?

193
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,440
What's at Downton that needs
your attention so urgently?

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
So...

195
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Shall we rescue it?

196
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,720
Shall we give the house
another chapter?

197
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,920
Well, I suppose
one has to live somewhere.

198
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,640
You're telling me we've
been feeding Ethel for some time?

199
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,320
We have, m'lady.

200
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,480
Well, supplementing her food.

201
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,840
I didn't think you'd mind,
what with the baby and all,

202
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,840
but Mr Carson suggested you'd like
to be informed, all the same.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Carson is right, Mrs Hughes.

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,160
But the girl was our employee
and, while she was in the wrong...

205
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Indeed she was.
Men will always be men

206
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,160
but for any young woman to let her
judgement so desert her...

207
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,080
She's not the first girl
to be taken in by a uniform.

208
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,240
And, don't worry, Carson, the baby
will make sure she pays the price.

209
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,800
Has she tried to get the father
to assume some responsibility?

210
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,720
She's tried and failed, I'm afraid.

211
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
I wonder.

212
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,200
If I were to write to Major Bryant,
inviting him to visit us again,

213
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,000
maybe Lord Grantham
can prevail on his good nature.

214
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm not sure
he's got one to prevail on.

215
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Satisfied? I feel sorry for Ethel,

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,680
but I cannot condone
her inability

217
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,040
to pronounce a simple
two-letter word: 'No'.

218
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,120
The wine delivery
should've been here by 12.

219
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,200
Get me out of the dining room
when they come.

220
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,280
Serve the main course
and let Jane finish. He won't mind.

221
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,560
Has Carson abandoned me?

222
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,400
He's dealing with a wine delivery,
m'lord.

223
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,680
Shall I fetch him?
No, no. I daresay we'll manage.

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,120
I hope you're happy here

225
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,760
and that your family arrangements
are not proving too complicated.

226
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,080
Your Lordship has a good memory.

227
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,640
All our lives
are lived around our children.

228
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
How old is your son?

229
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,160
12, m'lord.

230
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
Is he at the local school?

231
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,680
He is, but he's trying for
a scholarship to Ripon Grammar.

232
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,760
Is that a realistic prospect?

233
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I think so.

234
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,000
He has a real talent
for mathematics and...

235
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,120
his teachers believe
it's worth a try.

236
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
Well done him. I'm impressed.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Perhaps I can put in a word.

238
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm sure I should say
'He wants to do it all by himself',

239
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,960
but I'm not proud,
so if you can say anything, m'lord,

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
then, for heavens' sake do.

241
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,560
Jane, have you finished in here?

242
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,000
I hope she wasn't talking
out of turn, m'lord.

243
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Not at all, it was my fault,
I asked the questions.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,880
But surely, if His Lordship
asks him, he must do something.

245
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
Why? What difference will it make?

246
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,760
We're not in the 14th century.

247
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,040
But when he hears that Lord
Grantham knows what he's done...

248
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,040
What's he done that all young men
aren't anxious to do

249
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,280
behind the bicycle sheds
every night?

250
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,920
What am I going to do,
if Major Bryant doesn't come round?

251
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Who knows?

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,840
Go to a big city.

253
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,680
Invent a past.

254
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
You've broken the rules, my girl,

255
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,680
and it's no good pretending
they're easily mended.

256
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,560
Mr Bates, there's a telephone call
for you. It's your lawyer.

257
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Shall I come with you?

258
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Lady Mary was looking for you.

259
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,200
When was this?

260
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,880
When she got back from her outing.

261
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,200
Were you going to keep it a secret
all day?

262
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm going to fetch my button box.

263
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Thank you.

264
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,840
Any letters to post?

265
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,680
Look...

266
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,240
I know I've changed, and not
for the better, but even so,

267
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,000
do you really still
not recognise me?

268
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,200
I know. Why am I feeling so silly?

269
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
It's funny, isn't it?

270
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,800
I came here all the time
when I was growing up.

271
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
You were here?

272
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
At Downton?

273
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,440
You're not saying that you're...

274
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Patrick.

275
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
Yes I am.

276
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,960
That's exactly what I'm saying.

277
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,080
I've just been hoping you'd realise
without my having to spell it out.

278
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,720
But Patrick's...

279
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,160
Dead? Drowned on the Titanic?

280
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,760
Of course, this must be
very hard for you.

281
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,760
That's ridiculous.

282
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,000
No, I'm sorry, of course,
I'm not saying it's your fault.

283
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,760
It's mine. It's all mine.

284
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
Yes.

285
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,360
Thank you.

286
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Goodbye.

287
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,320
She's gone and told the judge that
I paid her to agree to a divorce.

288
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,640
I suppose you did, didn't you?
Yes, I bloody well did.

289
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,560
So what does it mean?

290
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
Because we withheld it
from the court,

291
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,920
it means the judge can withdraw
the Decree Nisi.

292
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,080
It means I'm not divorced,
after all.

293
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,920
Above all it means that
I am a stupid, stupid, stupid man.

294
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
This won't change a thing.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,240
We are going to be together,
whether she wants it or not.

296
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,080
If we have to leave here,

297
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,040
if we have to leave the country,

298
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,960
we are going to be together.

299
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,000
I was on the Titanic,
that much is true,

300
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,760
but I was pulled out of the water
by Fifth Officer Lowe,

301
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
the only one of them to come back.

302
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,640
At least,
that's what they said later.

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,960
When I properly came round,
they'd misidentified me as Canadian

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,880
and shipped me up to Montreal.
I don't understand.

305
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,320
Why didn't you just tell them
who you were?

306
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,960
Because I couldn't remember.

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,320
I don't know
if it was the blow to the head,

308
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,520
or the shock, or the cold,
but I had no memory.

309
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,920
As far as I knew, I was Canadian.

310
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
So... So what happened?

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Well, I had no reason
to go back to England

312
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,680
so, in the end,
I took my name from a gin bottle.

313
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,520
Then, in 1914,
I joined Princess Pat's Infantry.

314
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,800
And what changed?

315
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,320
I was caught in
a big explosion at Passchendaele.

316
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,280
When I woke up,

317
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
it all came back.

318
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,680
Suddenly, I knew who I was.

319
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,680
I began to call myself
Patrick again.

320
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,800
Why not your whole name?

321
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Why didn't you send a message
at once?

322
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
I nearly did

323
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,360
and then I heard that Downton was
an officers' convalescent home.

324
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,880
I thought that
if I came here and you knew me,

325
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,560
the hard part would be over.

326
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
But we didn't know you.

327
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Precisely.

328
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
I must... talk to Papa.

329
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,000
We've Matthew the new heir
to think about.

330
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,480
The new heir, yes.

331
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,200
This will be very difficult
for him, of course.

332
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,760
It must be so hard for you,
what with Mary getting married...

333
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,240
Did I love her very much?

334
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,600
Well, I'm the wrong person to ask.

335
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,720
Because you were the one
who really loved me, you mean?

336
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,640
I... never thought Patrick knew.

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, he did.

338
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,880
I-I do.

339
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
It's big.

340
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,160
The staircase is prettier
than the one here,

341
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
but mainly, it's just big.
Can we stop?

342
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I'd much rather see your face
when we talk.

343
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
So will you buy it?

344
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
Probably.

345
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,480
He says he wants to steal Carson
to come and run it for us.

346
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I don't envy you, telling your Papa.

347
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Suppose Carson won't do it?

348
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
Since he would open his veins
for you,

349
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I don't think there's much doubt.

350
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I don't have to marry him, you know.

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
Yes you do.

352
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,120
If I thought for a moment that I was
an argument against your marriage,

353
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,520
I should jump into the nearest river.

354
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,240
And how would you manage that,
without my help?

355
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,360
I'd get you to push me.

356
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Seriously, I can only relax

357
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,840
because I know that you have
a real life coming.

358
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,440
If I ever thought
I was putting that in jeopardy,

359
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I'd go away and never see you again.

360
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
You don't mean that. But I do.

361
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,560
I am the cat that walks by himself

362
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,640
and all places are alike to me.

363
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,040
I have nothing to give
and nothing to share.

364
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,000
If you were not engaged
to be married...

365
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,480
I wouldn't let you
anywhere near me.

366
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,840
You'd think he was
in Mary's sole charge.

367
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,560
I worry it'll mean a big adjustment
for him, when we marry.

368
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,640
I don't believe Matthew
has any desire

369
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
to stop her marrying, Richard.

370
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Quite the contrary.

371
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,200
Maybe, but is she as convinced
as he is that they have no future?

372
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
What are you saying?

373
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,960
I suppose I'm asking whether
you want Mary to have children.

374
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,040
Because, if you do,

375
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,360
isn't it time for Lavinia Swire
to come back into his life?

376
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,680
I wish I knew how an engine worked.

377
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I can teach you, if you'd like.

378
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
That's Edith's territory.

379
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
I thought you were avoiding me.

380
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Of course not.

381
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,600
But you haven't come up with
an answer yet, have you?

382
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Not yet, I'm afraid.

383
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,720
I know you want to play your part
in Ireland's troubles

384
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,520
and I respect that,

385
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,440
but I just can't think about it all
until the war is over.

386
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
It won't be long now.

387
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
So will you wait?

388
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,440
I'd wait forever.

389
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
I'm not asking for forever.

390
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Just a few more weeks.

391
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,560
You know, Old Ma Patmore's
not as mad as I thought.

392
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Why do you say that?

393
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,640
I've made some enquiries
and she's right.

394
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,040
There's a big demand for
rationed food if I can find it.

395
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,000
And can you?

396
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,440
Maybe. I've been given a name.

397
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,800
I'll have to come up with
the money though.

398
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,840
And can you find the money?

399
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,520
I think so.

400
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,720
I've a bit put by,
and I could borrow some.

401
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
It's a risk though, isn't it?

402
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,120
You've gotta speculate to accumulate.

403
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
Hadn't you heard?

404
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,920
No, but I know the one about
neither a borrower or a lender be.

405
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,040
What do you think?

406
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,400
All the chaps are wearing them
in London.

407
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,720
Only for informal evenings,
of course.

408
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm not sure you'll get much use
out of it, when the war is over.

409
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,560
Maybe not, but I can wear it when
Her Ladyship and I are on our own.

410
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
You're very preoccupied, tonight.

411
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,880
Papa, can I have a word? Now?

412
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
What is it?

413
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I think you'd better sit down.

414
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
I knew you'd be in here,

415
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,440
making last-minute adjustments.

416
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,720
'Never leave anything to chance, '
m'lady, that's my motto.

417
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Mine too, really.

418
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
Sometimes, I wish it wasn't.

419
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,560
I gather Sir Richard's asked you
about coming with us,

420
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
when we're married.

421
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,240
I need to hear what you think.

422
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,560
It's a terrific idea.

423
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,200
If anyone can keep me
out of trouble, it's you.

424
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
What about His Lordship?

425
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Of course, he'll kill me,

426
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
but I'm sure he'll understand.

427
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Well...

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,520
I'll give you my answer
when you've spoken to His Lordship.

429
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,120
It'd be a huge wrench for me
to leave Downton.

430
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Major Gordon...

431
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,200
Edith has given me
an account of your conversation.

432
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,280
She said she would.

433
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,320
I wish you'd spoken to me first.

434
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,960
Obviously, I need time
to consider what you've said.

435
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,240
Well, I can offer little proof,

436
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,160
except that I know things
only the real Patrick would know.

437
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
I was never fingerprinted,
or anything.

438
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,240
Presumably you understand that
people would be seriously affected,

439
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,880
should your story be true.

440
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,080
You mean Cousin Matthew?
It would be very hard on Matthew.

441
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,160
Of course it would but, Robert...

442
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,920
I-I mean, Lord Grantham,
if you'd prefer it.

443
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
I would, until we know more.

444
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,280
When I was in hospital,
I had my story written down.

445
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:20,280
So you can have it checked,
as far as that's possible.

446
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,240
Thank you.

447
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,960
I'll send it to my lawyers in London

448
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,680
and I'll break the news
to the family tomorrow.

449
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Where did you learn to do that?

450
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Do what?

451
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Never mind.

452
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Am I really a stranger?

453
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Do you not recognise me at all?

454
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,640
It feels very odd
to be talking so formally.

455
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,040
The whole situation is
certainly odd, that I freely admit.

456
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,960
The war may be at an end,
but the upheaval is only beginning.

457
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,600
How right you are.

458
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,880
That is why Downton Abbey still has
such an important role to play.

459
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
Dear me.

460
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
There's so much to be done.

461
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,680
When you think of all
the children laid up with disease...

462
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,640
But they're making
such advances now, aren't they?

463
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,160
Could we talk about the lecture
programme? If we must, we must,

464
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
if only I wasn't haunted
by those women

465
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,400
whose jobs will be snatched
from them when the boys come home.

466
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,280
We have to find work
for our heroes, don't we?

467
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,600
That must be our priority,
however hard that might sound.

468
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
As you say.

469
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,560
And what about
those wretched refugees?

470
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,320
What will become of them?

471
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,280
Now you've struck a chord.

472
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,360
Have I really? Thank heaven.

473
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,480
What do you mean? Nothing.

474
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,400
Only the thought of
those poor men and women,

475
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,120
flung across Europe,
far from their homelands

476
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,360
and so much in need of your help.

477
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,760
My help? Why do you say that?

478
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,000
When it comes to helping refugees,

479
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,360
your experience renders your value
'beyond price'.

480
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,400
One of the organisers said
those words.

481
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,320
Which organiser?

482
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,240
I forget.

483
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,400
But what about running Downton?
I mean, I can't do both.

484
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,520
Well, I suppose you must decide
what it more important.

485
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,360
Exercise classes
and lectures on pottery,

486
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,840
or... helping men and women
build a new life.

487
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,960
I must go,
but I will think about it.

488
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,080
Are you coming to
Cousin Robert's dinner tonight?

489
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,480
Are you?
Well, I didn't feel I could say no.

490
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,880
He sent a note this morning and was
most insistent. What's it about?

491
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,840
I have no idea,
but we'll talk there.

492
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,400
We're onto something for you.

493
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,040
We mustn't let the iron grew cold.

494
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,440
Thank you.

495
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,120
You know there is
nothing more ill-bred

496
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
than to steal
other people's servants.

497
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,920
But you're not 'other people'
and Carson brought me up.

498
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,120
What does he say? That he won't do
anything without your permission.

499
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,760
Which, of course, is so cunning.

500
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
How can I refuse a man
who says that?

501
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
What do you say, Bates?

502
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,760
I say Mr Carson must have the last
word on where he lives and works.

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You're ganging up on me.

504
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
You're a darling and I love you.

505
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Now, what's this dinner all about?

506
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Won't you tell me? You'll find out.

507
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,320
I'm sorry if it's a bit of a crush.

508
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,960
I didn't want to be overheard.

509
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,760
Are we talking financial ruin?

510
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,560
Or criminal investigation?

511
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,920
Neither.
I'll get straight to the point.

512
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,760
We have a patient
who has been badly burned

513
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,040
who goes by the name of
Patrick Gordon...

514
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,560
but he claims to be
Patrick Crawley.

515
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,320
But I thought he was dead.

516
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,120
Didn't he drown on the Titanic?

517
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,160
Well, of course, it is
what we all thought, until now.

518
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,240
They never found a body.

519
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,880
They never found lots of bodies.

520
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,240
I'm so sorry,
but I'm not quite on top of this.

521
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Who's Patrick Crawley?

522
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,640
The man who would displace me
as heir.

523
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,160
If he's alive, then I am no longer
the future Earl of Grantham.

524
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,800
It's ridiculous.

525
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,480
How can it be true? Where's he been
hiding for the last six years?

526
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,880
In Canada, suffering from amnesia.

527
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,400
He does have a story
that would explain it,

528
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,200
but I'm not quite sure about
how to test the facts.

529
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
He knows all sorts of things
that only Patrick,

530
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,280
or someone very close to him
would know.

531
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,920
What a stupid thing to say.

532
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Any fortune teller at a fair

533
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,280
comes up with a dozen details
he couldn't possibly know.

534
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,960
There's no need to be angry.

535
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,320
This young man
is either Patrick of he's not.

536
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
There must be a way to find out.

537
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,160
Is he like Patrick to look at?

538
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
He isn't like anything to look at.

539
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,600
I've sent his account off to George
Murray in London, to ask his advice.

540
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
What a waste of time and money.

541
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,000
What's the matter?
We were all so fond of Patrick.

542
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,680
You were going to marry him,
for heaven's sake.

543
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Aren't you glad, if he survived?
Dear me.

544
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,800
Should I be worried? Certainly not.

545
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
This man is a fake and an imposter.

546
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,760
I think it's a cruel trick to play,
when Matthew's been through so much.

547
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,920
My dear,
don't be too quick to decide.

548
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,480
You never know, this might be
a blessing in disguise.

549
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,200
What do you mean?
Well, he seems a nice enough chap.

550
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,880
He's not very pretty, of course,

551
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,240
but he can walk round the estate
on his own two legs

552
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,440
and sire a string of sons
to continue the line.

553
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,400
I'd say that's a great improvement
on the current situation.

554
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,200
Sybil, could I prevail on you
to take me back to my room?

555
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Of course.

556
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,910
Mrs Hughes, we've had a letter
in the evening post

557
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,550
from Major Bryant's father.

558
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,790
He must have found it
hard to write, for it seems

559
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,470
the Major has been killed
in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto.

560
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,470
How sad. I'm sorry to hear it.

561
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,310
I know and right at the end,
but there we are.

562
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:22,070
I'm afraid
it's the end of our story too.

563
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,110
What story is that, m'lady?

564
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,990
A friend of Mrs Hughes
knew the Major.

565
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:32,990
Can you relay the news? Of course.

566
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,430
Will that be all? Yes, thank you.

567
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,470
Is that the Major Bryant that Ethel
always thought so handsome, m'lady?

568
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,510
Too handsome for anyone's good.

569
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,390
I beg your pardon, Your Lordship,
I thought everyone had gone up.

570
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,030
Not yet.

571
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,070
Is there anything I can fetch you?

572
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,750
Nothing that would help.

573
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,350
Never mind me. Good night.

574
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:27,670
Not a shock, exactly, but obviously
it was a tremendous surprise.

575
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,710
So what happens next?

576
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,190
Papa sent your statement
up to his solicitor.

577
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,110
What is it?
Do you remember this place?

578
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,150
Of course I do.

579
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:40,190
How we used to hide over there?

580
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,710
Wasn't there a governess
none of you liked?

581
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,390
Fraulein Kelder.

582
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,150
That's it.  Fraulein Kelder!

583
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,630
What fun we used to make of her.

584
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,470
Do you know,
I do recognise you now.

585
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,190
Do you?

586
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,430
You haven't changed at all.

587
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,470
Not a jot.

588
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,150
God knows I have.

589
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,310
It's not important.

590
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,830
Edith, if you really mean it,

591
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,830
do you think once it's all settled,
we might talk again?

592
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,550
But, if they've read Her Ladyship's
letter, won't his parents know?

593
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,510
I don't think so. She only
invited him to pay a visit.

594
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:39,230
She thought the subject of the baby
would come better face to face.

595
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,830
Could I write to them?

596
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,990
You could try,
but where's your proof?

597
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,350
With him dead,
you've no evidence at all.

598
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,150
Then I'm ruined.

599
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,870
You were ruined already, my girl,
so don't let's us go overboard.

600
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:59,270
How's that new maid getting on?
The lady with the little boy.

601
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,310
Very well, thank you. Why?

602
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,390
Just thinking.

603
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:08,750
Everyone wants to help her,
to feed her, to find her work,

604
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,870
because her son's father is dead.
So is the father of my son.

605
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,950
Where's the difference?

606
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,230
The difference is Jane is
a respectable, married woman

607
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,190
that some man chose to be his wife.

608
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,830
Is that enough?

609
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,870
It is in the real world.

610
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,630
Carson, now, I wonder if I could be
put on the London train

611
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,350
at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning?

612
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,870
His Lordship's valet
is catching that one.

613
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,990
Would you object to his riding
in the front with the chauffeur?

614
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,950
Not at all. Meanwhile, have you
given my proposition any thought?

615
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,990
A great deal, Sir Richard.

616
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,230
I'll be back on the night of 10th.

617
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,710
Perhaps you could
let me have your answer, then.

618
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,590
Answer to what? As to whether
Carson will be captain of our ship.

619
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,430
With you at the helm, there's much
more chance of a smooth crossing.

620
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,830
Your Lordship,
I need to go to London tomorrow.

621
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,590
I've spoken to Mr Carson.
He has no objection.

622
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,390
Please say this concerns property
and not the former Mrs Bates.

623
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,830
I only wish she was 'the former',
m'lord,

624
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,110
or better still, 'the late'.

625
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,150
Indeed?

626
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,470
I have to reason with her.
I've found no other choice.

627
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,430
She's found a reason
to delay things again.

628
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:28,470
No, not delay.

629
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,510
She's found a way to ruin things.

630
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,630
Be sensible, Bates.

631
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,910
Above all, do not lose your temper.

632
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,390
A German Republic?

633
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,470
No, I don't think so, Mr Branson.

634
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:06,390
The Kaiser will go, I'll grant
you...

635
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,390
and maybe the Crown Prince too,
but there'll be a Regency.

636
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,150
Mark my words.

637
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,030
Monarchy is the lifeblood
of Europe. Sorry, Mr Carson,

638
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,230
but I think you'll find the kings
and emperors have had their day,

639
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,710
if President Wilson
has anything to say about it.

640
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,390
I'll have to go up to London.

641
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,990
What will you say to her
that you haven't said already?

642
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,910
I don't know, but I know staying
here won't make any difference.

643
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,110
You're always going to London,
Mr Bates. I have business in London.

644
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,470
Yes?
Well, judging by your expression,

645
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,750
your business
doesn't seem to be prospering.

646
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,870
The trick of business is
to mind your own.

647
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,910
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I...

648
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,310
I've just heard news
from the War Office

649
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,270
and I thought you'd all like
to know...

650
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,310
that the war is over.

651
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,830
The ceasefire will begin

652
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,590
at 11 o'clock on the morning
of the 11th of November.

653
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,230
Why can't it begin now?

654
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,710
The 11th of the 11th,
seems pretty tidy to me.

655
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,630
We will mark the moment
in the Great Hall

656
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,790
and I expect all of you - including
the kitchen staff and hall boys...

657
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,870
everyone to be there - and Carson.

658
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,230
It's such wonderful news.

659
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,790
Is there any more glasses up there?

660
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,550
We should make a toast together.

661
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,310
To peace.

662
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,350
To peace.

663
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,510
The truth is, Cora, there is a
reason for inviting you here today

664
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,630
and I fear I'm going to be
a great disappointment to you.

665
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:32,470
Cousin Violet is, in part, to blame.
Yes, I usually am.

666
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,110
It was she who drew my attention
to the plight of the war refugees.

667
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,270
I feel very guilty,
since I chivvied you,

668
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:43,550
and now I'm jumping ship,
but I can't run Downton as well.

669
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,990
You must go where
you can make a difference.

670
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,630
This is what I think,

671
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,030
but I hope you will consider
keeping the house open without me.

672
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,550
I must be honest with you,
it was your idea, not ours,

673
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,710
so I doubt very much
we'll go on with it, now.

674
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,870
But what does that matter

675
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,630
when one thinks of
the work you'll be doing?

676
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,910
Don't you agree, Mama?

677
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,390
I-I... cannot find the words
to say how I feel.

678
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,910
What - what do you think, Molesley?

679
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,990
Sometimes fate knows best, m'lady.

680
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,110
I couldn't put it better myself.

681
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,070
Well...

682
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,790
There really is
something for her to do?

683
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,790
Absolutely. It's all set up.

684
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:37,190
I had to promise to be a patron,
but it seemed a small price to pay.

685
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,350
I know it was
for Robert and the girls,

686
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,830
but I thank you, without irony,

687
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,070
from the bottom of my heart.

688
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,470
And I accept your thanks, my dear,

689
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:50,510
with no trace of irony either.

690
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,110
Lawyers take forever
to answer anything,

691
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,150
so they can charge more.

692
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,510
But the others don't believe me,
do they?

693
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,550
Not like you.

694
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,590
I think they want to be certain.

695
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,630
But how can they ever be?

696
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,270
If the lawyer casts
even the slightest doubt,

697
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:11,750
won't that give them the excuse to
cut me out and stay with Matthew?

698
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,790
If only one of them recognised me.

699
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,430
They will do, soon.

700
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,430
No they won't. They've forgotten me.

701
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,590
I'm a stranger to them now!

702
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,470
Well, you're not a stranger to me.

703
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,510
I wouldn't be Vera Bates.

704
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,670
He left here at dawn,
with a face like thunder.

705
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,590
I wonder if she knows
what she's started.

706
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,470
If I were you, I'd keep out of it.

707
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,150
Wise words.

708
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,830
How did you get on?
Yeah, it was interesting.

709
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,950
Daisy, I wish you'd let me
tell you about it.

710
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,110
There's no point. No point in what?

711
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,950
Jane keeps making out
I'm a war widow, but I'm not, am I?

712
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,630
You all know that.

713
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:01,670
I married William on his deathbed,
that don't count.

714
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,110
Course it counts. I don't think so.

715
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,870
And I wasn't good to him.

716
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:11,030
He thought I loved him,
but I didn't, not like he loved me.

717
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,190
I should never have married him
in the first place, only...

718
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,790
Marrying him was a great kindness.

719
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,350
No, it wasn't kind.

720
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,190
It was wrong.

721
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,270
Mr Bates, how did you get here?

722
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,110
I walked from the station.

723
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,710
You should've said.
We'd have sent someone to meet you.

724
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,190
I was glad of the walk.
I was glad of the air.

725
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,950
I never thought
you'd be back tonight.

726
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,590
How was it?

727
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,030
Worse than you can possibly imagine.

728
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,750
What's...?

729
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,550
I assume that whatever Mr Murray has
told you means the man is a fake.

730
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,510
You can't have asked Matthew to be
here, unless you know that.

731
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,470
It's very complicated.

732
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,390
Lowe was the only officer to go back
to the site of the wreck.

733
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,510
He did pull
some people out of the sea

734
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,670
and it seems one of the men
was unidentified. There.

735
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,350
One of the reports has him dying
before they reached the Carpathia.

736
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,990
Precisely.

737
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,790
Another witness says
the man did get to New York alive,

738
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,790
but there's no clear record
of his name.

739
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,310
Which could be Patrick Crawley.
There's more.

740
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,150
There was a Peter Gordon who worked
with Patrick at the Foreign Office.

741
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,190
Now, he emigrated to Montreal
in 1913.

742
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,350
Yes and when
his face was blown away,

743
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,230
he decided
every cloud has a silver lining.

744
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,710
He was perfectly placed
to impersonate his dead friend.

745
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:49,270
No doubt they shared confidences,
so he just brushed them up

746
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,710
and put himself forward for
a major inheritance.

747
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,390
Granny's right.

748
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,510
All he needed was a survivor
from the Titanic

749
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,430
who was unaccounted for
and he found one.

750
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,910
But the Titanic story bears out
Patrick's version in every way.

751
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,310
What do you think?

752
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,390
I don't know what to think.

753
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,030
How can you even hesitate?

754
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,830
But, Mary, you haven't heard
the things he remembers.

755
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,470
I don't need to.

756
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:14,350
I remember how we played,
and your pony, and your birthday,

757
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,110
and how we hid in the garden
from the nasty governess.

758
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,670
What other memories would you have
of a childhood spent here?

759
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,990
Murray will continue to investigate
so, Edith,

760
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,790
can we be polite to the man,
but nothing more?

761
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,190
The end of the war should make it
easier to unearth the evidence.

762
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,230
That is all for the time being.

763
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,310
I thought Carlisle was going to come
back for our ceremony tomorrow.

764
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:40,430
He's driving up. He'll be here
in time for dinner, tonight.

765
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,430
I'm sorry I can't be more decisive.

766
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,350
Don't be.
I meant what I said, the other day.

767
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,470
It'll take a man who is
more than I am now to follow you,

768
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,110
so don't think about me.

769
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,150
My dear chap, how can you say that?

770
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,190
I never think about anything else.

771
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,870
What do they make of this Peter
Gordon character they've uncovered?

772
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:08,910
Do they think that's who I am?

773
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,350
Do you remember him?

774
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,990
Very well.

775
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,030
Peter and I were good friends.

776
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,710
Very good friends.

777
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,950
Did you know he'd moved to Canada?

778
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,790
How could I, when I'd forgotten
who I was, until two months ago?

779
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,830
Of course.

780
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,870
So what will they do now?

781
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,030
Track him down, I imagine.

782
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,150
Find out what happened to him.

783
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,110
Suppose he joined
the Princess Pat Light Infantry?

784
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,630
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

785
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,750
Why would he?

786
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,310
You're very sweet, you know.

787
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:50,790
So sweet, you made me think
that all things were possible.

788
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:55,190
But perhaps the lesson is
you can't go back.

789
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,990
You're tired and I don't blame you,
but you're not to give up.

790
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,630
I won't let you.

791
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,910
We'll find this Peter Gordon,
I know we will.

792
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,950
Yes.

793
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:12,030
I expect you will.

794
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,630
They'll be going in to dinner
in a minute.

795
00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,190
We've built a good cellar here,
you know.

796
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,710
I'm not saying it's legendary,
but it's nothing to be ashamed of.

797
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,950
You've made your mind up, then?

798
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:39,150
I think so, yes.

799
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,910
I think I have...

800
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,670
but, with a heavy heart,
Mrs Hughes.

801
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,950
And just when we thought
we were getting back to normal.

802
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,990
Don't tell me you'll miss me.

803
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,270
I will, Mr Carson.

804
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,950
Very much.

805
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:00,990
And it costs me nothing to say it.

806
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,990
Thank you.

807
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,270
That means a lot to me.

808
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:14,630
Shall we go through with the ladies
and let them get in here? Of course.

809
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,270
I wonder what happened to Richard.

810
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,350
He'll have started late and...

811
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,350
I do apologise, Lady Grantham.

812
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,790
We got stuck in Royston and
a cart had overturned in Baldock.

813
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,510
Hello, my dear.
How lovely to see you.

814
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:31,190
Are you sure?

815
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,790
Sir Richard said
you were expecting me, but are you?

816
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,910
Of course we are.

817
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,950
Can you take Matthew into
the small library? Are you hungry?

818
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,270
We've finished, but Mrs Hughes can
easily put something on a tray.

819
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,310
Carson?

820
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,470
Nothing's changed.

821
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:59,470
But, you see, it has,
because I've changed.

822
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,150
When I was last here,

823
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,790
I was so bowled over
that I let you send me away,

824
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,430
but not this time.

825
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,470
I love you.

826
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:11,510
I'm going to look after you.
That's all there is to it.

827
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:15,990
And if I refuse?

828
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,390
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

829
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,950
You won't frighten me away,
whatever you do.

830
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,550
It seems such a waste of time
to drive from London

831
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:27,790
and get stuck in every town
on the way.

832
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:30,550
I don't agree. I'd love to drive

833
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:34,350
and you'd better agree if Anthony
Strallen comes back into your life.

834
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,510
Before you scold me,
it's no good pretending

835
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,350
Mary is not too attached to Matthew.

836
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,990
So you summon Lavinia,

837
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,350
to be sacrificed
like some latter-day Iphigenia

838
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,630
doomed to push his chair
through all eternity?

839
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,950
Robert, it's quite simple.

840
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,590
Do you want Mary's marriage
to be a success?

841
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:52,110
Do you want grandchildren?

842
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,510
Sometimes, Cora,
you can be curiously unfeeling.

843
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,390
Suppose he doesn't want
her back? Have you thought of that?

844
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:10,470
He needs someone to look after him.
Yes, but...

845
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,230
You'll be too busy
with our new life.

846
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:14,830
I know you're used to having
your own way. Yes, I am.

847
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:17,390
I'll say something now
I hope I won't have to repeat.

848
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,190
If you think you can jilt me,
or in some way set me aside,

849
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,070
I tell you now, you have given me
the power to destroy you.

850
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,110
Don't think I won't use it.

851
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,310
I want to be a good husband
and for you to be happy,

852
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,830
but don't ever cross me,
do you understand?

853
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,870
Never.

854
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,670
Absolutely never.

855
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,230
What's happened to Major Gordon?

856
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,150
He's gone.

857
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:53,510
But he can't have.

858
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,310
When?

859
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,350
After breakfast.

860
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,910
I couldn't very well stop him.
The war's over.

861
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,870
He left this for you.

862
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,470
What does it say?

863
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,310
'It was too difficult.

864
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:24,350
I'm sorry.

865
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:26,390
P Gordon.'

866
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,710
P for Patrick or P for Peter?

867
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,950
I know what you think,
but I don't accept it.

868
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,190
We drove him away.

869
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:46,030
His own family
drove our cousin away.

870
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:52,550
But you believed in him,
whoever he was,

871
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:55,270
and that's worth something.

872
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,430
I think, while the clock strikes,
we should all make a silent prayer

873
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,110
to mark the finish of
this terrible war...

874
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,150
and what that means
for each and every one of us.

875
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,590
Let us remember the sacrifices
that have been made

876
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:21,430
and the men who will never come back

877
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,990
and give them our thanks.

878
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,670
Thank you, everyone.

879
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,830
Remember, this is not just
the end of a long war,

880
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,270
but it is the dawn of a new age.

881
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,310
God bless you all.

882
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,270
Let me help you with that.

883
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,310
Can you get him back to his room?

884
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:33,350
I'll open the door.

885
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,750
My God.

886
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:42,790
Is something wrong, sir?

887
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,830
No, nothing.

888
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:47,070
Bates, if I felt...

889
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,710
If you felt what, sir?

890
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,990
It doesn't matter. Not yet.

891
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,830
Not until I feel it again.

892
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,550
I thought that was very dignified.

893
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,590
Very calming.

894
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,350
Thank you, m'lord.

895
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,590
I don't suppose you're having
any doubts about leaving?

896
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:09,750
I'm afraid not, m'lord.

897
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:12,710
Well, I can't say I'm not sorry.

898
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:16,870
I won't go until
we've found a proper replacement.

899
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,950
Whoever we find won't replace you.

900
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,350
Yes, of course. Mr Bates.

901
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:49,390
Telegram for you.

902
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,790
What was that about?

903
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:15,270
His wife's dead.

904
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,750
Someone found her,
earlier this morning.

905
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:34,710
I've found a dealer.
You mean black market business?

906
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,750
I'm anxious to make Lady Mary happy.

907
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,710
I've had a request from Sir Richard
that you ought to know about.

908
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,630
I think I've found a way to escape.
Nothing too drastic, I hope.

909
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,270
I want to tell you all something.
Girls! Cora! Come at once!

910
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:48,630
Does this mean
that you've made up your mind?

911
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:52,230
I'm a foolish man who's lost his way
and don't know how to find it again.

912
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,990
You said yourself,
there wouldn't be another chance.

913
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:56,830
I bought it. It was arsenic.

914
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,270
I've been thinking
that's what she must have taken.

915
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,230
Mary is still in love with you.

916
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,230

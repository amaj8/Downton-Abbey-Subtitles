1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,080
(BELL RINGS)

2
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, she's gone now.
Oh, that's a shame.

3
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,200
Nothing for me, Mr Carson?

4
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:54,880
No, Anna.

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,400
Once again, I'm afraid,
there's nothing for you.

6
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,880
Come on.

7
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,965
I've enough on my plate
without going into details.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,805
You're co-owner of this estate.
You have to get into detail.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
Not to challenge Robert, surely? No,
but you have to pull your weight.

10
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:46,520
That's all I'm saying.

11
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,560
How is Bates? I've not seen him
for a while, sir.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,005
Oh? Why's that?

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,520
I'm not quite sure, sir.
They've stopped his visitors.

14
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:59,925
Has he given you a reason?

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,165
He's not written
in quite some time now.

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
And you don't know why? No, but
I'm certain I will before too long.

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,525
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,640
Mrs Crawley, how may I help?

19
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,965
I'm sorry to push in on you again.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,040
I didn't have time
to come down before dinner

21
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,600
and now we're on our way home.
Oh.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,880
Mrs Hughes, you know
I went to see Ethel Parks?

23
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:36,000
I do, ma'am. She wouldn't
speak to me then

24
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:38,605
but she has since sought me out

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,240
and asked me to deliver
this letter to you.

26
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:45,045
(SIGHS) When we last spoke of her,

27
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,285
you seemed to think
she'd fallen into bad ways.

28
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,240
I'm afraid that's the case.
She's been working as a prostitute.

29
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,560
My, my. That's not a word you hear
in this house every day. No.

30
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,285
But I think it also shows
the measure of her misery.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,180
Ethel has been driven into this,
of that I have no doubt.

32
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:12,040
If only she would allow me
to help her, but she won't.

33
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,520
If this letter can give a clue as to
how I may help, please let me know.

34
00:03:18,555 --> 00:03:20,200
I will, ma'am.

35
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,965
Your sentiments do you credit,

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,480
but I suspect
she will be too ashamed

37
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,880
to face how far she's fallen.

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,720
Good night.
Good night, Mrs Crawley.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,320
So, am I to answer to you both?
Of course not.

40
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:45,805
What Lord Grantham means

41
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,920
is that I've made an investment
in the estate. That is all.

42
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:52,937
Otherwise, nothing has changed.
Very good.

43
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,920
Can we bring the staff
back up to snuff?

44
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:58,645
I believe we can.

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
Mrs Hughes is short of a house maid,
Mrs Patmore wants a kitchen maid

46
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:06,280
and I need a new footman.
Do you really?

47
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:08,565
I sometimes feel the world

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,085
is different than it was
before the War.

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,285
I would like to return
to my duties as a butler, sir,

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,440
but if you prefer I continue to do
the work of a second footman

51
00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:23,685
in addition... Mr Crawley does not
mean that, do you?

52
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,800
Certainly not. That is good news.
It's too late to get into shape

53
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,605
before the dinner
for the Archbishop of York,

54
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,720
but it'll be the last time
you'll have to fudge it.

55
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,800
I'll do my best with an added
spring in my step.

56
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,285
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?
Because I'm not married.

57
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Yes, but now that... The others are,
what difference would it make?

58
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:50,445
You know what I mean.
I prefer to be up and about.

59
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,580
Tennessee is going to
ratify the 19th Amendment. Meaning?

60
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:58,680
All US women will have the vote.
Which is more than here.

61
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,605
They almost do.

62
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't have the vote. I'm not over
30 and I'm not a householder.

63
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,440
It's ridiculous. You should write
to the Times.

64
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:09,485
Maybe I will.

65
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
Ask your mother if she needs
any help with tonight's dinner.

66
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:16,720
There's nothing so toffee-nosed
as a prince of the Church.

67
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,800
Put him next to your grandmother.
She'll handle him.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,960
(SIGHS)

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,040
Oh, Anna. You'll be happy to hear as
soon as we take on a new house maid

70
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:42,560
you'll be a lady's maid
to Lady Mary at last.

71
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,160
That's nice, Mr Carson. Thank you.

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,520
I thought you'd be more pleased.

73
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,005
No, I am pleased, really I am.

74
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,140
I've just got a lot on my mind.
Sorry.

75
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:56,205
I've also advertised
for a new footman.

76
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,800
He'll be second footman, won't he?
As to that, I will not pronounce

77
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:04,760
at this stage. Try to find a man
with something about him.

78
00:06:04,795 --> 00:06:08,337
I want the house
to be properly represented.

79
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:12,106
Is that aimed at me?
If the cap fits, wear it.

80
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,840
You're very quiet.
You'll never guess what.

81
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,960
I've had a letter from Ethel.

82
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,160
She wants to meet me,
but she won't come here.

83
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:25,845
What for? And why not?

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,480
She'd be uncomfortable.
Why, particularly?

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,520
Never you mind.

86
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,520
I think I'll ask Mrs Crawley
if we can meet there.

87
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:39,640
Heaven knows what Ethel
wants of us this time.

88
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,925
Cora said you were looking for me.

89
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,320
I've stolen the nursery
as a sitting room.

90
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,680
This is the paper,
unless you hate it.

91
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,400
Oh.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,925
Is that all?

93
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,920
Why? What did you think it was?

94
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,360
Cora said you'd been
to the doctor earlier.

95
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,885
I wondered why.

96
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,960
To find something for my hay fever.

97
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,920
What will we use for a day nursery
should the need arise?

98
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,760
I think we can worry about that

99
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,880
a little further down the line.

100
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,880
Oh, thank you, my dear,
that's very kind.

101
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,800
How much do I owe you? A guinea.

102
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,445
A guinea?

103
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,565
For a bottle of scent?

104
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,800
Did he have a mask and a gun?

105
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,605
(CHUCKLES)

106
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,920
How are you? All right, I suppose.

107
00:07:39,955 --> 00:07:42,005
I worry about you.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,205
That sort of thing is so horrid.

109
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,680
Being jilted at the alter?
Yes, it is horrid,

110
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
multiplied by about
ten thousand million. Well...

111
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:53,005
You must keep busy.

112
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,600
What with? There's nothing
to do at the house,

113
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,765
except when we entertain.

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,880
There must be something
you can put your mind to. Like what?

115
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:07,317
Gardening? No, you can't be
as desperate as that.

116
00:08:07,352 --> 00:08:11,720
Then what? Edith, dear,
you're a woman with a brain

117
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,125
and reasonable ability.

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,480
Stop whining
and find something to do.

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,880
(SIGHS)

120
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm going out, Anna.
I've told Mrs Patmore.

121
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:35,080
I think everything's
under control for tonight.

122
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,680
What's the matter? Nothing.

123
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,440
Except...

124
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,000
I haven't had a letter
from Mr Bates in weeks.

125
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,920
I worry... I worry
that he's being gallant

126
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:56,965
and trying to set me free,

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,040
that he wants me to make a new life
without him.

128
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,920
I doubt it very much.

129
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,960
Then why would he be silent
like this and stop me visiting?

130
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,565
Obviously, I don't know why,

131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,280
but I do know there'd be
a good reason.

132
00:09:13,315 --> 00:09:15,400
Do you really think so?

133
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
I'd swear to it.

134
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,240
They know you tricked them.
Who knows what?

135
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
Mr Durrant's a dealer
on the outside.

136
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,965
What's that to do with me?

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,085
He's working for your cellmate.

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,925
You punched Craig
so they set you up,

139
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,160
but you hid the stuff,
turned the tables on them.

140
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,240
Now they're angry.

141
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,440
And what can they do?
Tell you what they can start doing.

142
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,680
Durrant reported you
to the governor for violence.

143
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:16,165
You're officially
a dangerous prisoner.

144
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,160
The governor won't fall for that.
When's the last time your wife came?

145
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:23,720
How many letters
have you received lately?

146
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,920
Thank God. What a relief.

147
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,565
I thought she'd given up on me.

148
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,160
Don't thank God till you know
what else is in store.

149
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop talking!

150
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,205
Go on, then.

151
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,180
Tea spoon, egg spoon, melon spoon,

152
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:56,120
grapefruit spoon, jam spoon,...

153
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,720
Shall I tell you?

154
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
All right.

155
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,325
The bouillon spoon.

156
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,400
I thought soup spoons were the
same as table spoons? So they are,

157
00:11:14,435 --> 00:11:18,120
but not for bouillon, which is drunk
from a smaller dish.

158
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,200
Off you go now, I must get on.

159
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,880
You're taking a lot of trouble
with Alfred.

160
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,765
I feel quite jealous.

161
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,480
I don't know why. He asked for help.

162
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,480
You never did.

163
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,285
It's very hard to begin.

164
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,440
Well, find a way,
we all have lives to lead.

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,965
Could you write to the Bryants

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
to say I want them to have Charlie?

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,520
We've already been down this path

168
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,805
to no avail. I know.

169
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,840
and I know I said a mother's love was
worth more than they had to give,

170
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,205
but I said it for me, not for him.

171
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,220
My dear, you mustn't do anything
until you're absolutely sure.

172
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:14,200
Mrs Hughes said we all have lives
to lead, but that isn't true.

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I've got no life.

174
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,925
I exist, but barely. We know
the route you've taken.

175
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,840
It's good of you to have me here.
I work with others like you

176
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:29,205
to rebuild their lives.
Can't we work together

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,180
to find a way for you to keep
your son? With his grandparents,

178
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:37,120
Charlie can build a life that
is whatever he wishes it to be.

179
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:40,360
You and I working together
could never offer him that.

180
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,485
You want me to write to them again.

181
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,320
But leave it vague.
Say Ethel would like them

182
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:49,960
to keep in contact with their son.

183
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,800
I won't change my mind.
Nevertheless, that's what I'll do

184
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,925
then they'll be no disappointment.

185
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,600
If you'll forgive me,
we've a big dinner tonight.

186
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:03,200
Good day, ma'am. Ethel.

187
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,480
Ethel has had a very hard time
of it since she left us.

188
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,920
She's had great difficulty
making ends meet.

189
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:15,120
We know how she solved that problem.

190
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,240
Give my regards to Mr Molesley.

191
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,760
Until we meet again, my dear.

192
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,780
I had a coat.

193
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,965
It's there.

194
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,240
You will help Miss Parks.
Please, Mrs Bird.

195
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,560
Some manners wouldn't go amiss.

196
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,320
I do not believe it's part of my
duties to wait on the likes of her.

197
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm sorry, but that's what I feel.

198
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,965
I don't want to sound anti-Catholic.

199
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
Why not? I am.
Not in any real way, I'm sure.

200
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,365
I don't want thumb screws
or the rack

201
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,120
but there's something
of Johnny Foreigner about them.

202
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,060
I've no time to talk
but tell them I'm all right.

203
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm out of the flat,
they haven't stopped me.

204
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,160
Who hasn't stopped you?

205
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:45,897
Sybil?

206
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:47,600
'Hello?'

207
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,680
What's wrong? I've just had the most
peculiar conversation with Sybil.

208
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:15,085
She kept on about being
out of the flat

209
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,000
and nobody had stopped her and...
Stopped her from doing what?

210
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,840
I don't know. She suddenly
put down the telephone.

211
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,080
Dinner is served, My Lady.

212
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,885
Do you find the War
has driven the people

213
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,525
back into the churches
or further away than ever?

214
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,800
(BANGING ON DOOR) Behold,
I stand at the door and knock.

215
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:47,400
Someone sounds very angry.
Or very wet. Or both.

216
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:49,560
(BANGING ON DOOR)

217
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Do you any have luggage, sir? I
barely have the clothes I stand in.

218
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,840
Where are they? They're in the...

219
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:06,677
Tom! What's happened? Where's Sybil?

220
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,445
I had to get away,
leave her to follow.

221
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,840
I made arrangements.
She'll be on her way now.

222
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,200
Why are you here?
Why must she follow you alone?

223
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:18,085
I can explain.

224
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,280
There's a dinner going on but I'll
tell them you're here. No, don't.

225
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,960
No-one must know. I'll tell you
it all when they're gone.

226
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,680
What's the matter?

227
00:16:32,715 --> 00:16:34,445
Tom!

228
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,040
Get some dry clothes of Matthew's.
I'll come when the coast is clear.

229
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,000
Would you ask Mrs Hughes to sort
some food out for him? Yes, My Lady.

230
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,840
An idiotic man delivering a village
pamphlet. Can you imagine,

231
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:55,120
in this weather,
at this time of night?

232
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,800
It's Branson. He wouldn't come in.

233
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,245
Why not?

234
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,120
Is Sybil with him?

235
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,640
What's going on? She's not here
but apparently she's coming soon.

236
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:12,925
He'll explain
when our guest has gone.

237
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,080
Something to look forward to.
Other men have normal sons-in-law

238
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:21,200
who farm or preach or serve
their country.

239
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,845
No family is ever what it seems.

240
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,840
Do you think he's on the run
from the police? Don't be daft.

241
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,057
He hadn't the money for a taxi
from the station.

242
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,240
Maybe he fancied the walk.
Yes, he probably loves

243
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:36,965
a night walk in the pouring rain.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,040
What room is he in?
I'll take that, thank you.

245
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,000
So there'll be no more gossip
on that subject tonight.

246
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,005
They turned everyone
out of the castle,

247
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,480
Lord and Lady Drungore,
their sons and servants,

248
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:58,120
and then they set fire to it.

249
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,565
What a tragedy. Well, yes and no.

250
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,320
That house was hideous,
but of course, that is no excuse.

251
00:18:07,355 --> 00:18:10,245
No, it is not.
What was your involvement?

252
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,520
Who says I was involved? You know
a lot about it if you weren't.

253
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:18,445
Why are you running away?
And what's Sybil's part in this?

254
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,680
She's not involved. They think I was
part of it, one of the instigators.

255
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:26,837
The police are looking for you?
I couldn't go home.

256
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,936
If they took me,
I wouldn't get a fair hearing.

257
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:33,005
You gave them Sybil
while you saved yourself?

258
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,005
I don't think they'll hold her,
but if they do,

259
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,040
I'm ready to go back and face
the consequences. You'd better be.

260
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:44,077
You must see the Home Secretary.
And say what? The police say

261
00:18:44,112 --> 00:18:48,080
he was there, he says he wasn't.
I didn't say I wasn't there.

262
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,045
Why were you?

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,720
For the fun of seeing
private property destroyed?

264
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,365
Those places are different for me.

265
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,440
I don't see charm
and gracious living.

266
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,005
I see something horrible.

267
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,920
It's a jungle castle,
I rather agree. Mama,

268
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:08,800
you are not helping.
But when I saw them

269
00:19:08,835 --> 00:19:11,645
standing there with their children,

270
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,720
all of them in tears
watching their home burn,

271
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
I was sorry. I admit it.

272
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,880
I don't want their type to govern
Ireland, I want a free state,

273
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:25,120
but I was sorry.

274
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,920
Never mind that.
What's happened to Sybil?

275
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:31,417
We agreed that
I should leave at once

276
00:19:31,452 --> 00:19:33,845
and that she'd close the flat
and follow.

277
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,240
I got the last boat so she won't
be here before tomorrow. Good God!

278
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:42,245
You abandon a pregnant woman
in a land that's not her own

279
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,860
while you run for it?! You have
to go to London, for Sybil's sake.

280
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:51,440
You have to see Mr Short. I don't
have to do anything! I... Go to bed!

281
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,760
I'll give you my answer
in the morning.

282
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,200
(CRIES)

283
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,560
Of course, she married beneath her.
Says the Habsburg Archduke!

284
00:20:32,595 --> 00:20:34,925
What if he has to go to prison?
What then?

285
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,080
That's enough of that, thank you,
Miss O'Brien.

286
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:39,920
Bedtime, I think.

287
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,480
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

288
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,020
I'm going up. Good night.

289
00:20:49,055 --> 00:20:51,205
I'll try to keep them quiet,

290
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,700
but to be honest,
I knew it would happen.

291
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,125
I knew he'd bring shame
on this house.

292
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,165
It sounds as if he's on the run
from the police

293
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,040
and that Lady Sybil is languishing
in a dungeon in Dublin.

294
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,520
Let's wait and see
what the morning brings.

295
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,125
What in God's name is it?

296
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,285
An electric toaster. I've given it
to myself as a treat.

297
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,240
If it's any good, I'll suggest one
for the upstairs breakfasts.

298
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:25,160
Is it not enough that we're
sheltering a dangerous revolutionary?

299
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,080
Could you not have spared me that?

300
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,120
You've always had that.
(SPOON DROPS)

301
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,960
Hello.

302
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,720
Can we help you?
I'm here to see Mr Carson.

303
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,925
Who's this?

304
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,085
Jimmy Kent, at your service.

305
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,525
I'm Mr Barrow, His Lordship's valet.

306
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,020
I'm hoping to be
His Lordship's footman,

307
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,445
which is why
I'm looking for Mr Carson.

308

What's the matter? Have you all been
turned into pillars of salt?

309
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,960
May I help? I've come
for the interview.

310
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,685
I see.

311
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
Well, if you'll wait there.

312
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,560
I want to make it clear that whatever
I do, it's for Sybil and not you.

313
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:32,325
I find your actions despicable,
whatever your beliefs.

314
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,940
You speak of Ireland suffering,
and I don't contradict you,

315
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:39,485
but Ireland cannot prosper
until this savagery is put away.

316
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,780
Yes, but you must keep Tom out
of prison. I'll go to London today.

317
00:22:43,815 --> 00:22:48,347
I'll arrange an interview. I won't
come home till I've seen Short.

318
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:52,880
Thank you. I know it's right. For
him. And for Sybil and this family.

319
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:57,325
I suppose so. Let me know
if Sybil gets in touch.

320
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,160
She won't. She won't give them
anything to trace her by.

321
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,040
What a harsh world you live in.

322
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,560
We all live in a harsh world,
but at least I know I do.

323
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,660
I see you've been working for
the Dowager, Lady Anstruther.

324
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:23,480
Yes, but she's closed up the house
and gone to live in France.

325
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,965
She begged me to go with her
but I didn't fancy it.

326
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,880
I didn't think I'd like the food.
She begged you, did she?

327
00:23:30,915 --> 00:23:33,000
You know what women can be like.

328
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,440
Not, I suspect, as well as you do.

Right, Charlie,
let's put your hat on.

Yeah.

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,165
Thank you for letting us come.

336
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Why have we come? To hear more guff
about a mother's love? Mr Bryant,

337
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,405
that's not fair. Isn't it?

338
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,620
We know what you are now, Ethel.

339
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,765
We know how far you've fallen.

340
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,500
I didn't want Mrs Bryant to be in
the same room as you. He means...

341
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:24,200
How do you know? It's not hard
to find out about a woman like you.

342
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:28,360
I could give you a list
of your clients.

343
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,085
You've had me followed?

344
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,840
Didn't you think we'd keep
a check on our grandson?

345
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,200
We're not judging you.
I'm judging her.

346
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,640
I judge her and I find her wanting.

347
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,680
Ethel, we've decided
to offer you some money,

348
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,080
to make things easier
so you won't have to...

349
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,400
Unless you don't want to give it up.

350
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,720
Well, that's very generous,
isn't it, Ethel?

351
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,720
It throws a different light
on things.

A teddy. That's right.

Should I not take it in, then?

I can do that.
I'm sure I don't need your help.

Thank you, Mrs Bird.

Ethel, you don't have to do this.

360
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,440
You have a choice. You mean I should
take money from that man?

00:25:52,475 --> 00:25:56,125
It won't be much.
Enough to keep us from starving.

Even if Charlie doesn't go
to a famous school or university,

363
00:26:00,195 --> 00:26:02,160
you'll be there to give him love.

Yeah. I suppose Mr Crawley went
to a famous school and university.

haven't gone so well lately.

We both wish you well, don't we?

I don't wish you ill. I'll say that.

Not even for Charlie's sake?

I think you love my son, Mr Bryant.

you're a nice or kind man,

but I believe you love my boy.

So you'll be pleased
by what I've come here to say.

Any news while I was out?

No. Perhaps the Home Secretary
won't see him.

Not badly. I'm beginning
to get a sense of how it works.

394
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,480
It's probably best
you tackle it by yourself.

some tea? Oh, of course, My Lady.

Have you chosen the lucky winner?

398
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,320
Not yet. There were two candidates
when it came down to it.

One was steady but not much else,

400

but the ladies downstairs
want the other one.

Why is that?

I don't know precisely, unless
it's because he's more handsome.

403
00:28:48,635 --> 00:28:51,217
Of course it's because
he's more handsome.

and cheer us all up a bit.

they can buy their valentines.

00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,400
It wasn't like that. We thought this
might happen and decided what to do.

463
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,040
The question is what now? You must
not travel before the baby's born.

464
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,400
Tom wants it to be born in Dublin.
He won't hold you to that now.

465
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:20,365
Won't this be the first place
they look?

466
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,480
How could you be part of it?
The Drungores are like us.

467
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:27,405
She came out with me,
she was Laura Dunsaney then.

468
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,960
How could you dance round her burning
house? It's horrible. He didn't

469
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,040
and isn't dancing now.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

471
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
Telegram for you, My Lady.

472
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,760
Your father's coming home.
He's seen Mr Short.

473
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:49,285
What happened? He doesn't say,

474
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
only that neither of you
is to leave Downton.

475
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,160
You're back.

476
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,765
I am.

477
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,805
Anything happened here?
There's a new footman.

478
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,760
Came today. How was London?
Quite fun as a matter of fact.

479
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:12,525
Has the firebrand been saved?

480
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,800
That's not for me to say,
is it, Mr Molesley?

481
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:17,920
I'd better take these upstairs.

482
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,960
You got the job, then?
I'm on my way, Mr Barrow.

483
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:31,525
They say you were a footman once.

484
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,160
That's right. Can I come to you
if there's anything I need to know?

485
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:37,120
Certainly. Why not?

486
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,920
Never go back to Ireland?
Impossible. You'll be put in prison.

487
00:35:49,955 --> 00:35:51,965
It's the best I could manage.

488
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,620
Surely they need proof to ban a man
from his own country.

489
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:59,205
They have more proof
than Tom will concede. Is that fair?

490
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,020
He's admitted to being there. He's
told you. But he didn't tell me

491
00:36:03,055 --> 00:36:06,800
he attended meetings where attacks on
the Anglo-Irish were planned.

492
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,280
I was always against
any personal violence, I swear it.

493
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:18,565
So at least we can sleep
in our beds.

494
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,600
Maybe, but you weren't against
the destruction of property.

495
00:36:22,635 --> 00:36:24,765
That was worse than I expected.

496
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,200
What was the deal you made
with the Home Secretary?

497
00:36:28,235 --> 00:36:31,125
They don't want
to make a martyr of him.

498
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,800
With Sybil they think they could have
another Maud Gonne or Lady Gregory.

499
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:38,925
Lady Gregory. Countess Markievicz.

500
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,005
Why are the Irish rebels
so well born?

501
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,000
Whatever the reason, I don't want
Sybil to join their ranks.

502
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:48,405
Mercifully, nor do
the Irish authorities.

503
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,160
If Tom can stay away,
they'll leave him alone.

504
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,085
I can't be kept away from Ireland.

505
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,520
You'll be arrested the moment
you touch dry land.

506
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,205
Now, then, do what
Mr Carson tells you.

507
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,325
I know what I'm about.
Are you all right, Alfred? Yes.

508
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,400
Shouldn't I be carrying the pork
and you the veg? I'm first footman.

509
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:12,400
Never mind that, go.
Isn't Alfred first footman?

510
00:37:12,435 --> 00:37:14,765
That's for Mr Carson to decide.

511
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,200
By heck, it's nice to think we're
running at full strength again.

512
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:22,720
Really? I'm running at full strength
with no-one to help.

513
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:25,560
All in good time, Daisy.
All in good time.

514
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,120
What do you mean
you wrote to a newspaper?

515
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,405
No lady writes to a newspaper.

516
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,480
What about Lady Sarah Wilson?
She's the daughter of a duke.

517
00:37:37,515 --> 00:37:40,960
She's a Churchill.
The Churchills are different.

518
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:44,120
Have we no Churchill blood?
Granny's right.

519
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:46,565
Can somebody write that down?

520
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,760
It's good to have strong views
but notoriety is never helpful.

I've sent it now.
It won't be published.

Thank you for the vote
of confidence.

523

This is our new footman, Mama.
What do we call you? Jimmy.

524
00:37:59,715 --> 00:38:02,765
James, Your Ladyship. This is James.

525
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,840
Welcome to Downton, James.
Thank you, My Lord.

Well done, Carson.
That must've cheered up the maids.

528
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:16,685
He looks like a footman
in a musical review. Poor Alfred.

529

We mustn't allow him to be
overshadowed. Quite right, My Lady.

Hard work and diligence weigh more
than beauty in the real world.

531
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,000
If only that were true.

532
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,640
I've never been James in my life.
I was Jimmy to Lady Anstruther.

I don't care if you were
Father Christmas.

You're James now and will stay James
while you're at Downton.

535
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
He thinks he's the big cheese,
make no mistake.

536
00:38:46,755 --> 00:38:48,565
That's because he is.

He's nice, that new bloke, isn't he?

Why do you say that?
Oh, only an impression, that's all.

If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to bed.

540

Can you tell the others?
Tomorrow, we'll make some plans.

541

I don't know how.

542
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,800
You've lived out of Ireland before,
surely you can again.

543
00:39:16,835 --> 00:39:19,997
Ireland's coming of age,
I need to be part of that,

544
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:23,160
but I know what you've done
for me, kept me free,

545
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,320
and I am grateful, truly.

546
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,840
Poor chap, I'm sure he is grateful.
No, he's not.

547
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,445
He says it to keep the peace
with Sybil.

for her sake so we're even.

As a matter of fact, I did. Could
you make them out? I think so.

551
00:39:54,395 --> 00:39:58,525
I was waiting for a good moment
to discuss them. Oh?

552

Yes. There were some aspects
of the way things have been done

I wasn't quite sure about.
You sound like Murray.

Do I? He's always going on about how
we should overhaul this or that.

Nothing's ever right for him.
Well, I hesitate to say it...

That's enough of that. Alfred's
a footman, so don't listen to him.

612
00:44:44,755 --> 00:44:46,445
Shoo!

613
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,440
Tell me if you need any help.

614
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,720
Sorry, Daisy, what were you saying?

615
00:44:52,755 --> 00:44:54,720
Nothing. Don't matter now.

616
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,765
I hope we're going to get on.

617
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,240
We don't have to get on,
we have to work together.

618
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,045
A situation has arisen

619
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,405
and I'm not quite sure
which way to turn.

620
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,640
Obviously, if you've turned to me.
Robert won't discuss the matter

621
00:45:20,675 --> 00:45:23,960
and Mary is affronted
by the very mention of it,

622
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,160
but given that I've sunk my own
fortune alongside everyone else's

623
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:33,360
into... Into Downton.
..I feel a duty,

624
00:45:33,395 --> 00:45:35,800
apart from anything else,

625
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:38,000
to do what I can.

626
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,640
About?

627
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,920
Downton is being mismanaged,
cousin Violet,

628
00:45:42,955 --> 00:45:45,125
and something must be done.

629
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,880
The thing is how do I do it without
putting people's noses out of joint?

630
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:54,577
Oh, my dear. Oh, I doubt
there's a way to achieve that.

631
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:59,205
You must do what needs to be done,
of course, but...

632
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,320
I think I can safely say a great
many noses will be out of joint.

633
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,200

634
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,280
(CHUCKLES)

635
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,280
(SIGHS)

636
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,280
(LAUGHS)

637
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,725
Edith has been invited
to write a newspaper column.

638
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,280
When will she get an offer
to appear on the London stage?

639
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:57,800
I thought you might work here
for a while. You thought?

640
00:46:57,835 --> 00:47:00,165
I'm always a failure in this family.

641
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:04,645
She meant you to be hanged for her
suicide. It was her revenge.

642
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,320
What a revenge. Mrs Crawley's hired
a prostitute to manage her house?

643
00:47:09,355 --> 00:47:12,245
I don't remember Ethel
as a great cook.

644
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,160
Please tell Mr Barrow him to keep
his distance. What are you implying?

645
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,040

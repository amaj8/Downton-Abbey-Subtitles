2
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,460
Thank God.
Yes. Thank God.

3
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,140
And you.

4
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,219
How do we speak to him?
Normally.

5
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,179
How do you think you speak to him?

6
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,459
Do we pretend prison never happened?

7
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
I don't think that'll be necessary.

8
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,635
Welcome back, Mr Bates.

9
00:02:16,995 --> 00:02:20,314
I've waited a long time to say that.
Thank you, Mr Carson.

10
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,315
Too long.
Give us your coat.

11
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,234
Oh, Mrs Patmore, can you find
something for Mr Bates to eat?

12
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:29,754
I certainly can. Daisy! Ivy!
Stir your stumps!

13
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:31,475
Who's Ivy?
The new kitchen maid.

14
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:36,235
Thomas. Still here, I see.

15
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,234
Mr Barrow, now, Mr Bates.
And, yes, I'm still here.

16
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:42,074
And busy as a bee.

17
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:45,675
There have been some changes
since er... since you've been away.

18
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,874
You will have heard
about Lady Sybil.

19
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,874
Yes, I've heard.

20
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,195
Anna took a letter from me
to her Ladyship.

21
00:02:52,835 --> 00:02:55,234
There we are.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

22
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:57,074
Can we all have one of those?

23
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:59,395
Welcome back, Mr Bates.
Thank you, Daisy.

24
00:03:01,195 --> 00:03:03,195
Something nice?

25
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:06,754
The editor's written back,
repeating his offer.

26
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,594
He asks if I'm ever in London.

27
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:12,275
Why not? You could see Rosamund
and buy some new clothes.

28
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:16,035
He only wants to persuade you
to write for his horrible paper.

29
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,034
Still, I think I will go.

30
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:23,074
It seems rude not to in a way and
I haven't been to London for ages.

31
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:25,075
Excuse me.

32
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,554
Please don't encourage her.

33
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,555
I think it's a good idea.

34
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:35,914
I gather you've trapped
poor old Jarvis into a meeting.

35
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,274
It won't take long.
But he is the agent

36
00:03:38,275 --> 00:03:41,194
and there are things we must get
started on, if you agree.

37
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:44,595
Well, I'm glad you still think
my agreement has a part to play.

38
00:03:48,755 --> 00:03:51,995
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just cut and run, like me?

39
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,555
Bates! My dear fellow!

40
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:02,275
I didn't know you were here already!
They let you out at dawn.

41
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,554
Thank you for sending
Anna in the car.

42
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:06,714
Oh, nonsense.
Where have they put you?

43
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:08,754
In my old room, m'lord.
That won't do.

44
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:12,595
I'll ask Jarvis how far they've got
with finding a cottage. Thank you.

45
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:16,714
About Thomas?
I'll sort it out, Bates. I promise.

46
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,715
But in the meantime you just rest.

47
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:23,355
Stay in bed. Read books.

48
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:47,714
But you didn't walk out of my
luncheon when Robert asked you to.

49
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:50,635
Well, that luncheon was
to support Cora in her grief.

50
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:54,514
It did not seem appropriate
to let the whole thing

51
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:57,274
end in chaos and a quarrel.

52
00:04:57,275 --> 00:05:00,194
So you don't think I should have
given Ethel a second chance?

53
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:04,195
I do not criticise your motives,
but did you really consider?

54
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,635
Ethel is notorious in the village.

55
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,435
I don't think so.
I know so.

56
00:05:11,955 --> 00:05:14,914
You have surrounded this house
with a miasma of scandal

57
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,955
and touched all of us
by association.

58
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:20,634
I think one must fight
for one's beliefs.

59
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:24,595
And is poor Ethel to be the cudgel
by which you fight your foes?

60
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,515
Ah, Ethel.

61
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:36,115
I was just telling Lady Grantham
how your cooking has come on.

62
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:40,755
I'm studying, m'lady. These days,
a working woman must have a skill.

63
00:05:40,995 --> 00:05:42,995
But you seem to have so many.

64
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,435
I don't see how you can
just sack him.

65
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,074
He's done nothing wrong.

66
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:56,634
He can't have expected to stay
my valet once Bates was released.

67
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:58,635
Ask Carson. He'll have some ideas.

68
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,795
Poor little girl.

69
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,875
Has Branson said anything
more about moving out?

70
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:11,714
How can he move before he's found
a job? How can you want him to?

71
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:15,034
He's our responsibility now,
Robert - he and the baby.

72
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:17,035
We owe that to Sybil.

73
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:22,115
I must get on. I've got this
meeting with Jarvis and Matthew.

74
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,955
Have you got any plans, Mr Bates?

75
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,595
It's rather early to say. His
lordship suggested I have a rest.

76
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:36,354
I expect you'll be looking
for something to do, Mr Barrow.

77
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,355
Now that Mr Bates is back.

78
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:46,634
They're showing a film tonight
in the village hall. Way Down East.

79
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:49,154
It's about a woman
who survives in the wilderness

80
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:52,714
through her own wits and courage.
Blimey. They've stolen my story!

81
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,595
Lillian Gish is in it.
I like her.

82
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:56,994
There's a late showing tonight
at half past ten,

83
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,915
for the local servants.
What about it?

84
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,434
Are you going Jimmy?
Sounds a bit soppy, to be honest.

85
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,474
Well, I'm not going with
Alfred on my own.

86
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,714
My mum wouldn't like it.
She would not and nor would I.

87
00:07:06,715 --> 00:07:09,914
You may go if Madge
or Alice will go with you.

88
00:07:09,915 --> 00:07:13,635
But not otherwise.
All right. If Mrs Patmore agrees.

89
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:16,835
Straight there and back mind.

90
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:22,034
This means the overhaul of every part
of the estate we hold in hand

91
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:25,194
and some large new parcels
in addition.

92
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,234
All in an instant.

93
00:07:27,235 --> 00:07:30,114
But don't you see?
If we invest in new machinery,

94
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,674
new methods and new techniques,

95
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,714
the whole estate must benefit by it.

96
00:07:34,715 --> 00:07:38,194
And as for taking new lands in hand,
we won't be running it separately.

97
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:40,675
We'll find another use
for some of the farmhouses...

98
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:45,034
This is ridiculous! Downton has
existed for hundreds of years
in perfect harmony.

99
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:47,314
We have worked
with the farmers as partners.

100
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:49,354
Now you want to blow it all
to smithereens!

101
00:07:49,355 --> 00:07:51,394
Of course I don't, but -
If I may, my Lord?

102
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:55,194
Mr Crawley, you are very new
to our way of life here.

103
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,234
I beg your pardon!

104
00:07:57,235 --> 00:08:00,314
There's no point biting Jarvis's
head off. You are new to it.

105
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:03,754
Must I remind you of the state
the place was in a few months ago?

106
00:08:03,755 --> 00:08:06,355
That was nothing to do
with the way we run it!

107
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,955
The money was lost
in a bad investment.

108
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:13,114
And you've been bailing the place
out with Cora's fortune.
You have been for years.

109
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:16,955
Downton must be self-supporting if
it's to have a chance of survival!

110
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:25,075
Well, you've given us plenty to
think about. Hasn't he, Mr Jarvis?

111
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,915
He has indeed, Lord Grantham.

112
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:04,114
Why would I persuade your father
otherwise when I agree with him?

113
00:09:04,115 --> 00:09:08,234
How can you say that when you keep
telling me to find something to do?

114
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,434
I meant run a local charity

115
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:12,755
or paint watercolours or something.

116
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:15,874
Well, I'm going to London
to see the editor tomorrow

117
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:18,595
and if I like him
then I'm going to say yes.

118
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,594
I don't want to fall out with Papa,

119
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,795
but I don't want to be invisible
either.

120
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:26,515
I've had enough of it.

121
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:30,235
Very well. I'm coming up tonight.
I'll see what I can do.

122
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,595
But I want a favour in return.

123
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:47,555
Ethel? What's the matter?

124
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:51,755
I had rather a nasty encounter
in the village, that's all.

125
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:56,075
What sort of encounter?
Mrs Bakewell refused to serve me.

126
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,715
In the end her husband did,
but it wasn't very nice.

127
00:10:00,115 --> 00:10:02,075
We shall take our business
elsewhere.

128
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:04,434
There's no need for that, Ma'am.
I'm used to it.

129
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,435
You shouldn't have to be.

130
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:15,034
Are you all set for this evening?

131
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:19,314
If you mean have I allowed Ivy to go
out when it's not her half day,

132
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:21,554
I have, but why,
I could not tell you.

133
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,594
Bring them all home safe.

134
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,314
If that's Bechamel, why don't
you use parsley or mace?

135
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,594
I do. But I boil it
in the milk beforehand.

136
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,754
I made it last night.
Oh, leave her alone, you big ninnie.

137
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:34,474
There's nothing wrong
with a man who can cook.

138
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:36,914
Some say the best cooks
in the world are men.

139
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,114
And do we think this sad beanpole
will be the best cook in the world?

140
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:43,274
Why do you always feel the need
to be so unpleasant, James?

141
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,275
What's Alfred ever done to you?

142
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,594
Er... you can take in the fish
and meat tonight.

143
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:50,595
James can follow with the sauce.

144
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,954
But I should be the First Footman.
Of course you should.

145
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,554
Listen to her!
You're taller than him!

146
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,594
You've been here longer than him!

147
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:04,035
Why are you taking her to the
pictures when she talks like that?

148
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:07,075
Well, I've got the tickets now,
so...

149
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:16,755
Don't get up.

150
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:29,394
How's the Christening going?

151
00:11:29,395 --> 00:11:32,074
It's all arranged with
the Catholic Church in Ripon.

152
00:11:32,075 --> 00:11:34,114
Weren't you going to tell us?

153
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:36,154
You and Matthew?

154
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,595
I didn't think the others
would want to know.

155
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,315
Please give them a chance
to behave properly.

156
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,555
I wondered if you'd be a Godmother?

157
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,714
Am I allowed to be?

158
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,994
As long as at least one of them
is Catholic

159
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,995
and my brother's coming over.

160
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,195
He'll stay in the village.

161
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:15,195
No, he won't. He'll stay here.

162
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,354
He's a bit of a rough diamond.

163
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:20,355
I'm very fond of diamonds.

164
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,915
I still can't believe I'm here.
I keep pinching myself.

165
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:49,915
Believe.

166
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:54,234
Which one would be ours?

167
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:58,474
Well, they won't move Mr Chirk
or the Tripps,

168
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,795
but Mrs Bow wants to live in
the village, so we might get hers.

169
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,634
None of which solves the problem
of what I'm going to do.

170
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:09,074
Your job, of course. They'll have
to give Thomas his notice.

171
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:11,755
Mr Barrow.
Mr 'Stick-It-Up-Your-Jumper'.

172
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,155
He'll have to go.

173
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,795
Revenge is sweet.

174
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:29,274
Look at him.
He can't even balance it.

175
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,595
Oh, leave him alone. Up you go.

176
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:35,794
It's a flipping insult.
Just cos he's ten foot tall.

177
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,874
You're right.
I've got a good mind to...

178
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,875
Don't do anything you'll regret.

179
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:44,915
These things can be managed,
but not by losing your temper.

180
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,195
You make a cosy couple,
I must say.

181
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,475
I don't think so.
It's not what I've heard.

182
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:01,474
Alfred says he's always going on
about you.

183
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:03,514
Silly sloppy stuff.

184
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:05,874
Alfred's sick and tired of it
and no wonder.

185
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,914
Well, he's making it up.

186
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:09,915
Have it you own way.

187
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:24,515
Right, don't put them like that.

188
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,234
They've got to be able
to get hold of them.

189
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,075
That's why I've asked
Mr Murray to come up.

190
00:14:31,755 --> 00:14:34,714
You've asked Murray to come here
without consulting me?

191
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:37,795
I felt I wasn't explaining things
well and I know he can.

192
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:40,035
Oh, lovely. What a treat.

193
00:14:41,995 --> 00:14:44,754
Oh my, your ladyship!
No, no fuss, no fuss.

194
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:47,994
Just scrape me down
and get me a spare napkin.

195
00:14:47,995 --> 00:14:49,995
I'll take that.

196
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,354
I saw your cook in the village
today, Isobel. She seemed upset.

197
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:58,674
Yes. Mrs Bakewell was rather unkind.

198
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,434
It seems a pity that even
in this pretty little village,

199
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,474
people can be so unforgiving.

200
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:06,515
Some people are unforgiving,
others are insensitive.

201
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:12,075
What time do you leave in
the morning?

202
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,554
I thought I'd get the ten o'clock.
I'm meeting him for tea.

203
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,634
You're not encouraging this?

204
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,674
She hasn't agreed to anything yet.

205
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:23,514
Oh, Mama, talk to her. Talk to all
of them. Say something sensible.

206
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:26,394
Yes. Let's hear how a woman's
place is in the home.

207
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:29,714
I do think a woman's place
is eventually in the home,

208
00:15:29,715 --> 00:15:34,155
but I see no harm in her having
some fun before she gets there.

209
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:36,715
Oh, Granny! Thank you!

210
00:15:36,995 --> 00:15:38,995
Have you changed your pills?

211
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:42,554
And another thing. I mean,
Edith isn't getting any younger.

212
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:45,595
Perhaps she isn't cut out
for domestic life.

213
00:15:49,995 --> 00:15:51,995
How are your plans proceeding, Tom?

214
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:54,314
I was telling Lady Grantham.

215
00:15:54,315 --> 00:15:56,394
My brother has a garage
in Liverpool.

216
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:59,954
He's asked me to go in with him.
The brother who's coming to stay?

217
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:02,915
Yes. Kieran.
Why is he coming here?

218
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,075
For the Christening.

219
00:16:09,195 --> 00:16:11,034
How did he rearrange the spoons?

220
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:14,274
Right on the edge of my plate.
I'm not saying it was deliberate.

221
00:16:14,275 --> 00:16:16,634
I hope you're not,
cos I was trying to help.

222
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,954
Well, I think Alfred can manage
without your help in future, James.

223
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:23,395
And next time, will you wait to be
asked before you take charge?

224
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:25,874
Are you still here?

225
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,834
Perhaps Alfred no longer wants
to go to the pictures.

226
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:31,514
He may want to ponder
his mistakes instead.

227
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,595
Of course they're going.
Are we?

228
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:39,434
Yes, you can go.
I will not withdraw my permission.

229
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:42,274
But as you walk,
you might contemplate what it is

230
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:44,275
to waste a chance when it is given.

231
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:50,555
I suppose you never wasted a chance.

232
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,594
Well, if I did, I learnt from it
and that's all I am asking from him.

233
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,675
That and some ritual humiliation.

234
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:10,275
You shouldn't have rung Murray
without telling Papa.

235
00:17:10,755 --> 00:17:14,074
You berate me for not wanting
to take responsibility

236
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,395
and now you tell me off
for doing just that.

237
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,115
You can't have it both ways.

238
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,395
I can if I want to.

239
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:31,155
What's the matter?
Do you think I should see someone?

240
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,675
What? If there's anything wrong
then it's obviously my fault.

241
00:17:36,595 --> 00:17:39,035
You know what they told us
when I was wounded.

242
00:17:39,355 --> 00:17:41,355
But they were wrong. They said so.

243
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:44,955
I wonder.

244
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:49,114
Darling, please don't worry.
I'm sure there's nothing wrong.

245
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,755
That's the point. We're not sure.

246
00:17:57,195 --> 00:18:00,315
It was OK, but I prefer
English films with English stars.

247
00:18:00,475 --> 00:18:02,314
They seem more real somehow.

248
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,954
I like the American actors.
They've got more you-know-what.

249
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:08,314
Oh, and how about Ivy Close
in The Worldlings?

250
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:11,314
She makes Lilian Gish look like
a village school ma'am.

251
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,274
Ivy Close.

252
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:16,194
It's funny to think of a film star
having your own name.

253
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:20,075
There aren't any with my name.
No, but there's a King.

254
00:18:20,635 --> 00:18:22,674
The one who burnt the cakes.

255
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,755
Well, I hope I won't be burning
any of my cakes in future.

256
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:30,715
Where is everyone?
They've gone to bed.

257
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:34,395
Except for the picture-goers.
They're not back.

258
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:36,915
If I'd thrown a bucket of slop
in the old lady's lap,

259
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,155
I wouldn't be allowed
to go to the flicks.

260
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,835
What are you saying?
Mr Carson doesn't like me.

261
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:44,594
No matter what Alfred does,
he still prefers him.

262
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:46,715
It's not bloody fair.
Well, I love you.

263
00:18:47,035 --> 00:18:50,515
Well, if you do, you're on your own.
I'm sure I'm not.

264
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,674
What about your family?
Where are you from?

265
00:18:56,675 --> 00:19:00,034
I don't have any family,
not really. Cousins. You know.

266
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,715
No-one else.
And your mum and dad?

267
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,194
Dead. My dad was killed in the war

268
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:08,195
and my mother died of the flu.

269
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:11,275
I haven't any brothers
and sisters, so here we are.

270
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:13,835
All on me ownsome.

271
00:19:13,915 --> 00:19:16,275
You must get lonely.
Meaning?

272
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,995
I know what it's like, that's all.

273
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:22,755
Funny. We're quite a pair.

274
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,914
We both like to look very sure
of ourselves,

275
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,234
but we're not so sure underneath,
are we?

276
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,274
Still you've no need to worry.

277
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:33,074
Mr Carson may prefer Alfred,
but nobody else does.

278
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,114
Don't they? I wonder.

279
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:37,794
Sometimes I think
it's just Jimmy Contra Mundi.

280
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,714
Is that Latin? I should try and tell
Mr Carson - make up some points.

281
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:43,835
Never mind Latin,
I need a magic spell.

282
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,755
Good night.

283
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,875
He's a funny one, isn't he?

284
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,675
You can't pull the wool
over my eyes.

285
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:02,314
I know what's going on.
You're quite wrong, Miss O'Brien.

286
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:04,354
He's a proper little ladies' man.

287
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,394
If that's how you want to play it.

288
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:08,954
What are you going on about?!
There's no need to bark.

289
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,955
I only know what Alfred tells me.

290
00:20:12,555 --> 00:20:15,595
Well, if he says Jimmy's
interested in me, he's lying.

291
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,315
Would he?

292
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:21,155
Is it supposed to be a secret?

293
00:21:14,155 --> 00:21:16,955
Oh, you are daft!

294
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:21,874
Oh, Ivy, I love to be out
with you like this.

295
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,075
I wish we could make it
a regular thing.

296
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:29,075
I can't. I wouldn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

297
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:33,195
Look, I'm sorry,
but Jimmy's just not interested.

298
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:36,275
I hate to hurt your feelings
like that, but he's not.

299
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:41,155
You don't know that.
He flirts with me. He does.

300
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,155
If you knew he wasn't interested,
would that make a difference?

301
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,515
I'd have to hear it from his lips.

302
00:23:15,155 --> 00:23:17,715
Sorry to wake you, Jimmy, but...

303
00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:21,355
Oh, my... Get off!
Just get the bloody hell off me!

304
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:24,634
Alfred, it's not what you think.

305
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,674
Don't do that. Please.
Alfred doesn't matter.

306
00:23:27,675 --> 00:23:30,115
No-one will believe a word
he says. He's nothing.

307
00:23:30,116 --> 00:23:32,674
What are you doing?
Why are you in here?

308
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:35,714
Because of what you said.
Because of all there is between us.

309
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:38,754
There's nothing between us!
Except my fist if you don't get out!

310
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:40,794
And if you tell any...

311
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:42,794
But what about the things you said?

312
00:23:42,795 --> 00:23:45,755
I said nothing except
get out. Go on! Get out, Thomas!

313
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,154
What is going on?
Nothing, Mr Carson.

314
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:56,275
Jimmy, er... James had a nightmare.
He's fine, now.

315
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,094
What is it? What's going on?

316
00:24:32,534 --> 00:24:35,213
James? What's the matter with you?

317
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:37,214
Nothing.
Alfred?

318
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:40,974
Ask Mr Barrow.
It's nothing. Really.

319
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:43,574
It doesn't seem like nothing.

320
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:51,773
Ivy? Never mind the toast, you look
very tasty yourself, this morning.

321
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:55,533
What did you say?
Can't a red-blooded man
compliment a pretty girl?

322
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:57,534
Not at breakfast for Heaven's sake!

323
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:03,413
Alfred, what's happened?
Not now.

324
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,613
Well, if there is anything
I ought to know,

325
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:08,134
I hope I hear about it
before the end of the day.

326
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,494
This really has been so interesting.

327
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,253
I hope this means
you're persuadable, Lady Edith?

328
00:25:36,254 --> 00:25:38,694
I'll think about it, I promise.

329
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:42,773
I just felt I had to meet you
and see what it would be like.

330
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:44,613
I assume your father disapproves.

331
00:25:44,614 --> 00:25:47,653
Well, it's the business of
parents to worry, isn't it?

332
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:51,093
No, all sorts of toffs are writing
for magazines nowadays.

333
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:54,734
Some of them even advertise face
creams, cigarettes and the rest.

334
00:25:54,974 --> 00:25:58,054
I'm afraid Papa would not
find that reassuring.

335
00:25:58,814 --> 00:26:01,733
In fact, if he were here
he'd probably just shout, 'Run!'

336
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:04,853
Will you please make up your own
mind without his advice?

337
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,294
I'll have to think about that too.

338
00:26:09,494 --> 00:26:11,653
Are you going back
to Yorkshire tonight?

339
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,654
No. I'm staying with my aunt.

340
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:17,093
I've got to look in to the offices
of The Lady while I'm here.

341
00:26:17,094 --> 00:26:18,933
Not to write for them, I trust?

342
00:26:18,934 --> 00:26:22,133
Oh, no. It's just something
I promised to do for my grandmother.

343
00:26:22,134 --> 00:26:24,613
The Lady? That's Covent Garden?
Here's an idea.

344
00:26:24,614 --> 00:26:27,173
Let's er, let's have lunch
tomorrow at Rules.

345
00:26:27,174 --> 00:26:29,094
If you accept the job
we'll celebrate.

346
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:31,694
If it's a no, I'll drown my sorrows.
How's that?

347
00:26:34,614 --> 00:26:36,854
You seem nervous today, Barrow.

348
00:26:39,374 --> 00:26:42,774
We will get things sorted out.
We won't leave you in the lurch.

349
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:48,654
I'd be grateful if you could let me
know when you've made a decision.

350
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,734
I'll talk things through
with Carson

351
00:26:50,735 --> 00:26:52,774
and we'll see what we can
come up with.

352
00:26:55,934 --> 00:26:58,853
It makes no sense to retain
this bit as a separate section.

353
00:26:58,854 --> 00:27:00,693
No sense at all.

354
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:03,933
But of course Jarvis won't see that
because he hates change.

355
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:06,853
Just try to carry Papa
with you. That's all I ask.

356
00:27:06,854 --> 00:27:10,013
He'll be with me in the end because
this is the only way forward

357
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,253
and at some point
he's going to see that.

358
00:27:12,254 --> 00:27:14,293
Some point in the near
future I hope.

359
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:18,013
What's the matter with you both? You
were in a dream all through dinner.

360
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:20,014
Nothing's the matter!

361
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:23,013
Does Mr Murray
want luncheon tomorrow?

362
00:27:23,014 --> 00:27:25,893
No. He's in York all morning.
He'll come up here afterwards.

363
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,014
Followed by Tom's brother
for dinner.

364
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:31,293
So it promises to be
a day of contrast.

365
00:27:31,294 --> 00:27:33,333
God in heaven.

366
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,693
What do you think, Tom?
I agree with Matthew.

367
00:27:35,694 --> 00:27:38,693
The estate can offer proper
compensation to the tenants now

368
00:27:38,694 --> 00:27:41,253
while the money's there.
But if we miss this chance

369
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:43,574
it may not come again.
So says the Marxist.

370
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,653
If you don't mind me saying so,
you have a narrow view of socialism.

371
00:27:47,654 --> 00:27:50,373
You seem to have a very broad
interpretation of it.

372
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:52,413
Now, now, children.

373
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:56,053
If Branson is watering down
his revolutionary fervour,

374
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,054
let us give thanks.
Tom.

375
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,973
Do you know anything about farming,
Tom?

376
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:05,454
A little. My grandfather
was a sheep farmer in Ireland.

377
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,173
Why do you keep giving me funny
looks? I'm not.

378
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:12,053
What's going on?

379
00:28:12,054 --> 00:28:14,733
Have you both been up to
something I don't know about?

380
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,734
Not both of us.

381
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,934
Are you awake?

382
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:28,894
I can't seem to get
to sleep. I don't know why.

383
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:35,854
Could you credit Matthew summoning
Murray without my permission?

384
00:28:36,454 --> 00:28:39,934
You keep telling everyone
Downton's a Dual Monarchy now.

385
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:43,614
I never realised you didn't mean it.

386
00:28:44,694 --> 00:28:48,693
So, you're against me over Matthew,
the Christening and Edith.

387
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,694
Robert...

388
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:54,854
even your mother spoke up
for Edith. Think of that.

389
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:58,174
A facer, I admit.

390
00:28:58,694 --> 00:29:01,373
She'll have had some reason
of her own, of course.

391
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:03,374
Is she really so Machiavellian?

392
00:29:05,014 --> 00:29:07,014
Yes.

393
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,853
I was afraid you'd stood me up.

394
00:29:23,854 --> 00:29:26,814
I'm so sorry.
It took much longer than I thought.

395
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:30,373
What was it about?
Oh, just family stuff.

396
00:29:30,374 --> 00:29:32,453
An errand for my grandmother.

397
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,454
Are you very family minded?

398
00:29:35,014 --> 00:29:39,693
Well, when you live at home
with your parents, you're still
in the middle of all of it.

399
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:43,813
I saw a picture in the paper
of your elder sister's wedding.
She looked glamorous.

400
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:45,653
People say so.

401
00:29:45,654 --> 00:29:48,573
Am I allowed to say I'm rather
pleased you're not married?

402
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,413
I'm a little less pleased.

403
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,614
Oh, dear. It sounds like
you're hiding a romantic secret.

404
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:56,173
Not too romantic.

405
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:59,293
A little while ago,
I was jilted at the altar.

406
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:02,093
Which wasn't much fun.
Oh dear, I am sorry.

407
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,133
Oh, please don't be.

408
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:07,213
It's a relief to be reminded
I'm not an object of pity

409
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:09,253
to the entire world.

410
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:12,733
I've clearly put my foot in it,
and now you'll turn the job down.

411
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,574
Please don't.
I won't.

412
00:30:16,054 --> 00:30:18,054
Not if you don't want me to.

413
00:30:19,654 --> 00:30:21,654
Ah.

414
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,773
Surely, Lord Grantham,
you don't question Mr Crawley's goal

415
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:28,253
of making the estate
self-sufficient? No.

416
00:30:28,254 --> 00:30:31,293
But I question his plans
for the employees and tenants

417
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:33,133
in order to achieve it.

418
00:30:33,134 --> 00:30:35,453
Can't we allow things
to evolve more gently,

419
00:30:35,454 --> 00:30:38,333
as we did in the past?
The past is not much of a model.

420
00:30:38,334 --> 00:30:40,653
The third Earl nearly went bankrupt,

421
00:30:40,654 --> 00:30:42,933
the fourth only saved the estate
by dying

422
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:44,973
and what would you all have done
in the '90s

423
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:47,013
without Lady Grantham's money?

424
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,613
I say, Murray. When I asked you
to say what you think,

425
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,653
I didn't mean to be taken literally.
Must we talk in this way?

426
00:30:52,654 --> 00:30:54,654
Yes, I'm afraid so.

427
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:57,213
Thanks to Mr Swire
we have another chance,

428
00:30:57,214 --> 00:30:59,214
but we have to change our ways.

429
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:03,773
All I'm talking about is investment,
increasing productivity

430
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:06,293
and reducing waste.
Waste?!

431
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:09,573
Yes. The estate has been run
very wastefully for many years.

432
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:11,813
I won't listen to this!
Now, come on, Jarvis.

433
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:14,813
If I can listen to it, so can you.
No, Lord Grantham, I can't!

434
00:31:14,814 --> 00:31:18,253
Am I to stand here,
after 40 years of loyal service,

435
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:22,013
to be accused of malfeasance
and corruption!

436
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:26,333
Nothing of the sort!
My dear chap. Think for a moment.

437
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:28,933
We must both see things
have to move forward.

438
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:31,493
My goal is to find the way
of least disruption.

439
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:33,294
Won't you stay and help
me with that?

440
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,654
My Lord, will you give me
a good reference?

441
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:40,293
Yes, of course I will.

442
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:44,774
Mr Jarvis, if I have offended you,
then I offer my sincerest apologies.

443
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,614
I am the old broom, Mr Crawley.

444
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,454
You are the new.

445
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,894
I wish you luck with your sweeping.
M'lord.

446
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:10,814
Mr Carson, you'd better come.

447
00:32:13,854 --> 00:32:16,413
May I help you?
This is Mr Branson's brother.

448
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,693
Can we fetch Mr Branson, sir?

449
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:21,694
I've already sent Alfred.
Here they are now.

450
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:29,693
Kieran? What are you doing
down here? Come upstairs.

451
00:32:29,694 --> 00:32:33,174
I don't fancy it. Can I not stay
put and have my dinner down here?

452
00:32:34,134 --> 00:32:38,173
But we're all so looking forward
to meeting you, Mr Branson.

453
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:41,934
If you come with us, you can see
your room and get changed.

454
00:32:42,614 --> 00:32:46,614
If you want to. And what would I
change into? A pumpkin?

455
00:32:51,494 --> 00:32:54,613
Come on, Tommy.
Come and eat down here.

456
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:57,333
They seem like a nice lot.
What's the matter?

457
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:59,693
Are you too grand for them now?

458
00:32:59,694 --> 00:33:01,693
They know that I'm not,

459
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:05,773
but my mother-in-law has been
kind enough to invite you to stay
and dine.

460
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:09,014
And I'll not let you
snub her. Now, get a move on.

461
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:34,133
I know. You always said he would
bring shame on this house.

462
00:33:34,134 --> 00:33:37,413
No, Mrs Hughes.
For once, I will hold my tongue.

463
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:42,214
I thought Mr Branson's respect for
her ladyship's invitation exemplary.

464
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:48,094
Well. 'Mr' Branson's done
something right, for a change.

465
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,694
Miracles can happen.

466
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:54,534
How was it?

467
00:33:56,974 --> 00:34:00,173
Pretty bad. Jarvis has resigned.

468
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:03,053
What?
He's gone

469
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:05,974
and I'm going to have to make it
all work or I've had it.

470
00:34:08,494 --> 00:34:10,494
Come here.

471
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,614
You'll make me untidy.

472
00:34:14,174 --> 00:34:16,174
Good.

473
00:34:19,054 --> 00:34:21,413
You see, I know it's right, Mary.

474
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:24,573
I believe I can make Downton safe
for our children,

475
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,574
if we ever have any.

476
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:29,374
But I can only do it
if you're with me.

477
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,774
But what about Papa? I do love him.

478
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:37,053
Love him by all means,

479
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:39,054
but believe in me.

480
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:50,774
There. Will that convince you?

481
00:34:52,134 --> 00:34:54,134
Convince me again.

482
00:35:04,254 --> 00:35:07,374
And don't say,
'If we ever have any.'

483
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,974
Because we will.

484
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:19,887
But it's been a while now.

485
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:25,086
What if Mr Carson finds out you knew
all along and you never told him?

486
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:27,846
How will that look?
Surely it's for Jimmy to tell?

487
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:29,886
Supposing he's in on it?

488
00:35:29,887 --> 00:35:32,766
No. He started yelling
at Thomas as soon as I walked in.

489
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,567
Yes, I'm sure he did.
As soon as you walked in.

490
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:38,029
What if you hadn't walked in?

491
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,868
I'm sorry, Alfred. Mr Carson won't
tolerate these sort of shenanigans

492
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,269
and he'll be furious if he finds out
you knew and said nothing.

493
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:50,149
You need to speak up.
For your own good.

494
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:08,548
And what exactly does this business
consist of?

495
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:10,628
Automobile refurbishment.

496
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,629
He means car repairs.

497
00:36:13,749 --> 00:36:16,588
I see. And you would live nearby?

498
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:18,428
We've rooms over the garage.

499
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:20,588
There's a bit of a park
not too far away.

500
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:22,628
Well, that's something.

501
00:36:22,629 --> 00:36:24,829
I remember an evening
rather like this.

502
00:36:25,189 --> 00:36:27,948
We were travelling back
from Scotland to London

503
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:31,228
when the train was suddenly engulfed
by a blizzard

504
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:35,109
and we spent the night in a
tradesmen's hotel in Middlesbrough.

505
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:40,668
So who's coming to the Christening?
All of us, I expect.

506
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:44,228
Granny? Well, yes.
If Branson... Tom wants me to.

507
00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:46,668
I would be honoured.
Robert, are you coming?

508
00:36:46,669 --> 00:36:49,508
Tom doesn't want me there
and I wouldn't know what to do.

509
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:51,628
All that crossing
and bobbing up and down.

510
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:55,229
I went to a Mass once in Rome, it
was more like a gymnastic display.

511
00:36:57,629 --> 00:36:59,748
I would like you
to be there very much.

512
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:01,589
Why? What difference would it make?

513
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,229
All I know is Sybil
would want you there.

514
00:37:05,629 --> 00:37:07,548
She loved you with all her heart

515
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:09,549
and she would want you there.

516
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,309
Will you argue with that?

517
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:20,749
Not if you think it's so important.

518
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,748
How did you get on in London?

519
00:37:23,749 --> 00:37:25,988
Well, as a matter of fact,

520
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:28,028
I've got an announcement to make.

521
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:30,029
Now is as good a time as any.

522
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,029
Listen, everyone.

523
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,269
You have a journalist in the family.

524
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:40,908
Since we have a country solicitor
and a car mechanic,

525
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:42,909
it's only a matter of time.

526
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:47,029
How was the editor in the end?

527
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:50,789
Oh, nice, very nice.

528
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:55,108
So you're ready to speak out?

529
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:59,108
I think you're right and I must.

530
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:03,268
Good. He has broken all
the fundamental laws of God and man.

531
00:38:03,269 --> 00:38:07,029
Report him as you should and then
stand back and enjoy his fall.

532
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,669
I don't understand.

533
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:13,708
You've placed an advertisement
in a magazine,

534
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:17,228
to find a job for my housekeeper?
I knew you'd be against it.

535
00:38:17,229 --> 00:38:21,029
Well, how would you feel if I found
other work for your cook or butler?

536
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:25,108
Granny feels that for Ethel's sake
she should move elsewhere.

537
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:27,988
Oh, nonsense. She couldn't
give tuppence about Ethel

538
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:29,988
or anyone like her!

539
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:33,109
You've been reading those
Communist newspapers again.

540
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,668
I don't suppose there's any beer?

541
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:39,468
Haven't you had enough?
Of course we have beer.

542
00:38:39,469 --> 00:38:41,868
We must have some somewhere. Carson?

543
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,908
I believe so, m'lady. I'll fetch it.

544
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:48,108
What's the betting we'll have
a chorus of Molly Malone

545
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,349
before we finish? You're the one
pushing Tom into his brother's arms.

546
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:57,069
This is not what Sybil wanted
for him. She told me.

547
00:38:58,749 --> 00:39:02,148
Oh, Carson. Would you ask Mrs Hughes
to meet me in the hall, please?

548
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:06,668
Very good, m'lady. I'll bring
the beer in a moment, sir.

549
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:08,669
It isn't so bad here, after all.

550
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:15,028
I don't know.
She just asked if you could go up.

551
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:17,029
I suppose I'll have to.

552
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:19,149
What's this?
They said we could go.

553
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,188
They'll ring when they need the car.

554
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:24,549
Mr Carson, might I have a word?
Well, I have to take this up.

555
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:28,229
Oh, very well then. Come with me.

556
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:32,188
Mrs Hughes, you have always
taken an interest in Ethel.

557
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:34,189
Do you think I'm wrong?
No.

558
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:39,148
While Ethel is in this village
she is doomed to be lonely.

559
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:43,748
But if, as her ladyship suggests, she
can get a job far away from here...

560
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:47,628
She's not a bad cook now
and with a respectable reference,

561
00:39:47,629 --> 00:39:49,668
which of course you can give her...

562
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:54,388
I can't get over how you've planned
all this without a word to me.

563
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:57,989
Well, I knew you wouldn't agree.
I know how you hate facing facts.

564
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:01,989
I resent that. I'm sorry, but I do.

565
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:07,549
Mrs Crawley, I hope you don't see
me as an intolerant person.

566
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:11,229
No.
Because I agree with her ladyship.

567
00:40:12,069 --> 00:40:15,268
In a new place,
where she can start again,

568
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:17,348
Ethel has far more chance
of happiness

569
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:21,949
than in re-enacting her own version
of The Scarlet Letter in Downton.

570
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:24,709
What is The Scarlet Letter?

571
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:27,868
A novel. By Nathaniel Hawthorne.

572
00:40:27,869 --> 00:40:29,869
It sounds most unsuitable.

573
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:34,789
I'll talk to Ethel.

574
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:44,708
I don't understand what you're
saying. Thomas was doing what?

575
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:48,228
That's what I saw, Mr Carson.
And what was James doing?

576
00:40:48,229 --> 00:40:50,268
I think he was asleep,

577
00:40:50,269 --> 00:40:53,188
because he just woke
and he got very angry...

578
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,028
As he should have been, by God.

579
00:40:55,029 --> 00:40:58,068
My auntie says he might have been
faking because I walked in,

580
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,908
but it didn't look fake to me.

581
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,749
Well, we can always rely on your
aunt to take the ungenerous view.

582
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,988
You will not speak of this
to anyone. Is that clear?

583
00:41:10,989 --> 00:41:13,668
I don't want to hear the subject
even mentioned

584
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:16,749
in the Servants' Hall.
Very good, Mr Carson.

585
00:41:17,549 --> 00:41:20,268
The world can be a shocking place,
Alfred,

586
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,509
but you are a man now and you must
learn to take it on the chin.

587
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,988
Beg pardon, Ma'am. I was miles away.
That's all right.

588
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:37,428
I just wanted to let you
know that I was back.

589
00:41:37,429 --> 00:41:39,828
Would you like some tea?
No, thank you.

590
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:41,829
I'm going straight to bed.

591
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:47,989
Ethel...

592
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:51,269
are you happy?

593
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:56,869
Well, I... I suppose I'm happy
compared to what I was before.

594
00:41:57,069 --> 00:41:59,069
You see I...

595
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,269
Never mind.

596
00:42:03,669 --> 00:42:05,669
Good night.

597
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:14,668
How can I still be here when
all the young have gone to bed?

598
00:42:14,669 --> 00:42:17,548
The motor's ready when you are.
When is Jarvis leaving?

599
00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:19,549
I'm not sure.

600
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:22,429
It seems a poor return
for 40 years of service.

601
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:27,268
Maybe. But he was your father's man.

602
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:31,709
To him, you were always
the young master, never the Chief.

603
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,748
Which does not alter the fact
that now we must find someone else.

604
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:38,388
But you've already found him.
What do you mean?

605
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,748
Well, obviously the answer
to a thousand different questions

606
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:44,269
is to give the position to Branson.

607
00:42:45,069 --> 00:42:48,268
Tom.
Well if he's the agent,

608
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:50,709
we can call him Branson again,
thank heaven.

609
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:53,669
That's a mad plan.
It's not.

610
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,588
Tom and Matthew can work
on the new ideas together.

611
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:59,348
They're the same age.
But what does he know of farming?

612
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:02,268
His grandfather was a farmer.
In a small way.

613
00:43:02,269 --> 00:43:05,989
Which means he has more practical
experience than Jarvis ever had.

614
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,389
Think of the child.

615
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,228
You cannot want
your only granddaughter

616
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:15,229
to grow up in a garage
with that drunken gorilla?

617
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:18,349
Don't we owe this to Sybil?

618
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:23,108
I'll do it on one condition.
No, two.

619
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:25,348
First, Matthew must agree.
He will.

620
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:29,108
Second, you will both admit it
when you realise you were wrong.

621
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:32,188
Oh, well, that is an easy
caveat to accept

622
00:43:32,189 --> 00:43:34,189
because I'm never wrong.

623
00:43:37,189 --> 00:43:40,229
I don't need to tell you
that this is a criminal offence.

624
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:42,589
We hadn't done anything.

625
00:43:42,669 --> 00:43:45,708
But you were hoping to do something
if Alfred hadn't come in.

626
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:49,068
It's not against the law to hope.
Don't you get clever with me

627
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:51,069
when you should be horsewhipped!

628
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,308
Do you have a defence?

629
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,309
Am I mistaken in any part of this?

630
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:07,069
Not really, Mr Carson.
As for a defence, what can I say?

631
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,708
I was... very drawn to him

632
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:13,709
and I'd got the impression
that he felt the same way.

633
00:44:14,389 --> 00:44:16,388
I was wrong.

634
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:18,429
It seems an odd mistake to make.

635
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:21,308
When you're like me, Mr Carson,

636
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:25,748
you have to read the signs as best
you can because no one dares
speak out.

637
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:29,229
I do not wish to take a tour
of your revolting world.

638
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:32,029
No.

639
00:44:32,629 --> 00:44:35,468
So, are you saying

640
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:39,068
that James is the innocent party
in all this?

641
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:41,069
Yes, Mr Carson, he is.

642
00:44:42,229 --> 00:44:44,268
I will take time to consider.

643
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:46,908
We must first find out
what James intends to do.

644
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:50,029
He'd be within his rights
to report you to the police.

645
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,829
Although I'm quite sure
it won't come to that.

646
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:01,468
Will you give me your word
that nothing had happened?

647
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,468
I will, yes.

648
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:05,509
Right. Good night.

649
00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:16,748
Mr Barrow looks very grim faced.

650
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,909
Never mind him.

651
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:23,389
Human nature's a funny business,
isn't it?

652
00:45:24,669 --> 00:45:27,948
Now why didn't the poets
come to you, Mr Carson?

653
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:30,989
They'd have saved themselves
a lot of time and trouble.

654
00:45:36,749 --> 00:45:38,789
What's this?
I hope you don't mind.

655
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,988
If you could all
form a group around the father.

656
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,909
Kieran. Right, Mama,
do you want to go next to Isobel?

657
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:57,989
It seems so strange
without Sybil here.

658
00:46:00,029 --> 00:46:02,309
She's watching. I know.

659
00:46:03,269 --> 00:46:05,269
I envy you. I wish I did.

660
00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:08,909
Ever so slightly, thank you so much.

661
00:46:09,669 --> 00:46:12,748
You want me to take on the running
of the estate? It's a big job.

662
00:46:12,749 --> 00:46:15,468
Think of it as a Christening
present from Sybil.

663
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:18,509
It's a wonderful idea, Tom.
I'm ashamed it wasn't mine.

664
00:46:20,469 --> 00:46:23,468
Perhaps one with
the grandfather holding the baby?

665
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:25,829
And maybe the great
grandmother with him?

666
00:46:32,029 --> 00:46:35,109
And what about Father Dominic
who Christened her?

667
00:46:42,629 --> 00:46:44,668
What's the matter, Robert?

668
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:48,069
Are you afraid you'll be converted
while you're not looking?

669
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:53,629
I'm to leave with no reference,
after working here for ten years?

670
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:57,308
Are you sure about Rose? Wouldn't
it be better if she stayed here?

671
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,709
No, no, no.
I'm quite looking forward to it.

672
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:01,829
Perhaps I'll run away.
Not this time.

673
00:47:05,469 --> 00:47:07,388
Oh, my G...

674
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,669
I ought to report him to the police.
What?

675
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,627
I never wanted to push it this far.

676
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:16,589
I must hand in
my resignation at once.

677
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,489
Robert, the last time you made
an investment you ruined the family!

678
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:26,251

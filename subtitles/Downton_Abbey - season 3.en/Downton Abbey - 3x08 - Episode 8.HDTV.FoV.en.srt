2
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:38,742
I think it's held up very well,
all things considered.

3
00:00:38,743 --> 00:00:40,742
Especially after all that rain.

4
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,582
How's the house team coming on?

5
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,622
Because we're taking this
very seriously in the village.

6
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:50,102
Nobody takes it more seriously
than his lordship, Dad,

7
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:51,902
whatever he likes to pretend.

8
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,982
Mr Bates has had his rest now
and wants to get back to work.

9
00:00:55,983 --> 00:01:00,743
It's time to draw a line under
this whole unfortunate episode.

10
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:03,863
So I go out the window.

11
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:10,022
I cannot hide that I find
your situation revolting.

12
00:01:10,023 --> 00:01:15,422
But, whether or not you believe me,
I am not entirely unsympathetic.

13
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:19,422
You have been twisted by nature
into something foul,

14
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:22,782
and even I can see
that you did not ask for it.

15
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:26,742
I think it better
that you resign, quietly,

16
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:30,742
citing the excuse
that Mr Bates has returned.

17
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:34,142
I will write
a perfectly acceptable reference

18
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:38,463
and you'll find that there's nothing
about it that's hard to explain.

19
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:41,263
I see.

20
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:43,622
What about tonight?

21
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,478
It's nearly time to change,

22
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,999
so you should dress him tonight
and let Mr Bates take over tomorrow.

23
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:01,278
I'm not foul, Mr Carson.

24
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,838
I'm not the same as you,
but I'm not foul.

25
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:06,839
Yes, well...

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,559
We've spoken enough on this subject.

27
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,799
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll ring the gong.

28
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,718
Come along, Miss O'Brien.
Stop eavesdropping and do some work.

29
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,319
I don't know what you...

30
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,118
How are you getting on
with the cricket team?
We should be all right.

31
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:35,318
We've still got Thomas, thank God.
Won't he be leaving soon?

32
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,398
Not before the match,
if I've got anything to do with it.

33
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,998
One of the gardeners told Anna
their team is in terrific shape.

34
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:45,038
It's so unfair the outside staff
play for the village.

35
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,678
Why don't you support the house
AND the village? You own both.

36
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,398
But I'm captain of the house team.

37
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,918
If I were you I'd be captain
of the village. They always win.

38
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,358
Not always.
Usually, but not always.

39
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,478
Mary, you look
as if you're in a trance.

40
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,998
What were you doing in London?
It's worn you out.

41
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,999
Maybe. I'll try and rest tomorrow.

42
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,878
Crikey.

43
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,359
I'd better go.
Before you do,

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,398
a little bird tells me
Mr Carson has made up his mind
to deal with Thomas after all.

45
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,838
It's about time.

46
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:22,238
If you want to register your anger
at how Thomas treated you,
now is the hour.

47
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,078
I'm not sure. I'm still disgusted
by the whole thing, obviously.

48
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,519
Obviously.

49
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,238
But if you don't speak out,

50
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,959
people might think
you weren't disgusted at all.

51
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,999
Now you must excuse me.
I ought to be upstairs.

52
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,158
Anna! What are you doing out here?

53
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,998
Her ladyship's with Lady Mary, sir.
I'm afraid she's going to be late.

54
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,599
Let me see what's happening.

55
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,958
You couldn't be in better hands
than Dr Ryder's, truly.

56
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,198
I hope to God you're right.

57
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,479
Anna's worried you're getting late.
Heavens, you made me jump.

58
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,999
I must go. O'Brien will scold me.

59
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,558
Anna?

60
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,039
What were you talking about?
Nothing.

61
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,559
Women's stuff.

62
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:17,198
Your ears must have been burning
earlier. Papa was discussing
the cricket match.

63
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,678
The village thrashed us last year.

64
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,718
I suppose I'll have to play.
You suppose right.

65
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:26,199
Because of last year he's absolutely
determined to win this time.

66
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:31,598
Bates must count himself lucky
to be out of it.

67
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,918
I think he'd like
to walk normally, sir,

68
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,878
even if playing cricket
was the price he had to pay.

69
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,638
Of course he would. I'm so sorry.
That was stupid of me.

70
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,519
It's quite all right, sir.
I was only joking.

71
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,398
Oh, there's no question
that some people have a feel for it.

72
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,958
I think cricket's
like anything else.

73
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,198
When you learn it as a child,

74
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,518
there's an understanding
that is hard to come by later.

75
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,558
And with a father like mine...

76
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:01,878
I was brought up
with cricket in my blood.

77
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:07,238
Why have you never played in a match
before? How could I? I didn't work
at the house until this year.

78
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,638
I could hardly play
for the village team.

79
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,078
We'll have to start
a fan club, won't we?

80
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,518
That's kind, Ivy, but I just
want to do my best for the house.

81
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,158
That's all the reward I seek.

82
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:20,279
Your modesty is an example
to us all, Mr Molesley.

83
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,198
What is that you're so glued to?
This week's column.

84
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,078
I've got to send it off tomorrow.
What's it about?

85
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,718
The poor soldiers. How many are
reduced to begging on the streets.

86
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:42,278
And some officers are working
as dance partners in nightclubs.

87
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,438
After the trenches, even the Embassy
Club must seem an improvement.
You shouldn't make fun of them.

88
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,719
She's forgetting that you were
in the trenches and she wasn't.

89
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,798
She must be 18 by now.
Little Rose, 18? Yes. How scary!

90
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:57,838
Hello.

91
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,678
It's quite a responsibility.
Well, I couldn't say no.

92
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:06,118
Her mother is my niece
and my godchild, and she
asked it as a special favour.

93
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,559
Apparently, she hates London.

94
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:13,038
And they can't get to Scotland
until July.

95
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,798
Poor Shrimpie. His work
keeps him nailed to his desk.

96
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:23,558
She hates London, so she's coming
to a great-aunt in Yorkshire
to have a good time? Mm-hm.

97
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,518
How original.

98
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,158
Don't be silly. Of course you will.
No, I won't.

99
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,478
I'd like to help but I've never
played a game of cricket in my life.

100
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:34,118
Oddly, the game was never
a part of my childhood.

101
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,158
Didn't you play last year?
No, nor the year before that.

102
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,318
The fact is I've never played
cricket. But couldn't you try?

103
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
Robert! Stop being such a bully.
Let's just have a nice dinner.

104
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,158
I'm afraid I've heard
Mr Carson's going to let him off.

105
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,518
What can I do about it?
Say you won't tolerate it.

106
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,198
Unless he's going to give him a bad
reference, you'll tell the police.

107
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,478
I couldn't do that. Could I?
Why not?

108
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,358
And won't you have to,

109
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,998
if you don't want folk to think
there's something funny about you?

110
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:15,239
It's a good job
that's supposed to be eaten cold.

111
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:26,238
Are you sure about Rose? Wouldn't
it be better if she stayed here?

112
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,918
No, no, no.
I'm quite looking forward to it.

113
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,758
I couldn't manage an 18-year-old
these days. I wouldn't know
what she was talking about.

114
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,638
My husband was a great traveller,

115
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,318
so I've spent many happy evenings
without understanding a word.

116
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,798
The thing is to keep smiling

117
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,559
and never look as if you disapprove.

118
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,238
So, Bates, I'll see you
on duty tomorrow.

119
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,478
Good night, Barrow. You do know
I wish you every good fortune?

120
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,319
I believe so. Thank you, m'lord.

121
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,359
To the victor the spoils.

122
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,318
What will you do?
Oh, what's it to you?

123
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,199
You're right. It's nothing to me.

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,278
If we can buy out Simpson
and Tucker, quite a chunk
of the estate will be back in hand.

125
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,119
We'll be operating a real business.

126
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,398
That's why I think the cricket
may have come at rather a good time.

127
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,438
Why? Because you think if you get
a few runs and catch someone out,

128
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,798
Papa will accept all this gladly?

129
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,638
I think the cricket will show him

130
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,918
it doesn't mean we can't keep up
the old traditions as well.

131
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,038
And I'm to help persuade him?

132
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,959
Of course. You're on MY team now.

133
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,038
You can kiss me, but that's it.

134
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,798
Why? Haven't you missed me?

135
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,438
Desperately.

136
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:09,759
But... London seems
to have tired me out.

137
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,358
Come.

138
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,879
Mr Carson,
is it true Mr Barrow's leaving?

139
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,558
Yes, and...

140
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,838
for what it's worth,

141
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,518
I think he was genuinely mistaken
over the, er... incident,

142
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,278
and he's sorry now,
which, of course, is no excuse.

143
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,838
I want to be sure
you'll give him a bad reference.

144
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,078
I'm sorry?

145
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,798
I can't let a man like that go
to work in innocent people's houses.

146
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,718
I will write him the character
I think he deserves.

147
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,438
Can I read it?
Certainly not!

148
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:03,158
Because I've been thinking...
I ought to report him to the police.

149
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,198
What?
It's my duty.

150
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:08,758
I know today thinking is much
more liberal. Now, just a minute.

151
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,639
I've never been called a liberal
in my life and I don't intend
to start now.

152
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,559
But I do not believe in scandal.

153
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,958
Mr Barrow will go, and when he does
I would like him to go quietly,

154
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,038
for the sake of the house,
the family,

155
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,039
and, for that matter, you.

156
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,998
I'm sorry, Mr Carson,

157
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,638
but I can't stay quiet if my
conscience prompts me differently.

158
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,239
I won't turn a blind eye to sin.

159
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,749
I've asked Ethel
to bring us some coffee.

160
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,549
Oh, I'm not supposed to drink coffee.
My mother doesn't approve.

161
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,189
Would you like something else?
Absolutely not.

162
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,749
After all, she won't find out
unless you tell her.

163
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,189
How is Lady Flintshire?
Incredibly busy.

164
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,189
Daddy works harder than a slave,

165
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,949
so she has to manage
everything else by herself.

166
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,150
I doubt he works
harder than a slave.

167
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,389
Cousin Isobel is very literal.

168
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,310
Now I have something for you.

169
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,749
Shall I pour, ma'am?

170
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,670
No, thank you. I'll do it.

171
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,229
These.

172
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,350
The first answers
to the advertisement.

173
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:11,549
Cousin Violet is trying
to find a new job for my cook.

174
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,430
That sounds rather inconvenient.

175
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,829
Cousin Violet has never let a matter
of convenience stand in the way
of a principle.

176
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,790
As the kettle said to the pot.

177
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,870
I'm to leave with no reference?

178
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,910
After working here for ten years?

179
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,629
I'm afraid my hands are tied.

180
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,030
I'll never get a job now, Mr Carson.

181
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,949
Does his lordship know about this?
No.

182
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,509
Then I'm going to tell him.

183
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,390
And how would you do that
without telling him the rest of it?

184
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,630
This wasn't Jimmy's idea.
Somebody's put him up to it.

185
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,629
He wouldn't be so unkind,
not left to himself.

186
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,829
I'm almost touched that you will
defend him under such circumstances,

187
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,750
but... there it is.

188
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,230
Well, can I stay here
for a day or two while I...
come up with some sort of plan?

189
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,989
Yes, I think I can allow that.

190
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,350
But that's the best I can do.

191
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,510
Thank you, Mr Carson.

192
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,590
At least it doesn't smell damp.

193
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,710
I think it's nice.

194
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,229
Or it will be
when it's got a lick of paint.

195
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,030
I can do that.

196
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,389
I can.

197
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,029
You're not climbing any ladders.

198
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,709
But yes,

199
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,789
together I think we can make it
really comfy.

200
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,829
What do they call extreme optimism?

201
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,349
They call it
making the best of things.

202
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,350
And that is what we will do.

203
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,390
You being in this room
is enough to make it nice.

204
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,550
Come here.

205
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,949
We should think of some things to do
while you're here.

206
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:24,069
Edith, you should take Rose
to Whitby market on Wednesday.
She'd enjoy that.

207
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,669
I can't.
I'm going to London on Wednesday.

208
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,469
Oh! Well, could I come?

209
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,829
Oh, but you've only just got here.

210
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,869
I thought you hated London.
Who told you that? Susan!

211
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,429
Oh, darling Mummy.

212
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,189
Well, should I correct her?
Oh, no. She's right, really, but...

213
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,349
I'm planning a surprise for her

214
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,589
and I need to go to London
to arrange it.

215
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,429
You won't give me away, will you?

216
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,310
Won't you stay with your parents?
I can't. It would spoil everything.

217
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,949
You can stay with me.

218
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,869
Aunt Rosamund won't mind,
and there's plenty of room.

219
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,750
I don't even know where you're
going. To see my editor,
to discuss my article.

220
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,309
I think I might
come up with you to London.

221
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,629
I'll ring the office in the morning.
I can stay at my club.

222
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,029
Don't do that. Aunt Rosamund
would love to have you.

223
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,349
And... I suspect I'll need help
controlling Rose.

224
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,709
Why do you say that? I'm not sure.

225
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,669
Instinct.

226
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,109
When your mother finds out, will
she mind? No, she'll be delighted.

227
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,349
And so grateful to all of you
for helping with my secret.

228
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,230
Besides, with Edith as my chaperone,
what harm can I come to?

229
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,549
But how can I help?

230
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,269
If our plan works, we'll be farming
a third of the estate directly.

231
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,709
And you can manage that?
We think so.

232
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,389
But we need you to think so too,
because Lord Grantham
definitely won't.

233
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:53,309
Are you drawing up
the battle lines? Poor Robert.

234
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,110
The post-war world
has not been kind to him.

235
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,389
How are you getting on
with the agent's house?

236
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,429
I hope Jarvis didn't leave it
a wreck. No, not at all.

237
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,669
But the furniture was his,
so I'll have to begin
in a state of Trappist simplicity.

238
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,349
I'm sure there's some stuff in
the attics here. We'll have a look.

239
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,789
What about Sybbie?

240
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,429
Won't it be lonely for her,

241
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,349
just you and Nanny
and nobody else for company?

242
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,750
I think it's right for both of us.

243
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,750
Mr Barrow?

244
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,470
What in heaven's name
are you doing out here?

245
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,589
I know you're leaving, but things
can't be as black as all that.

246
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,869
You're trained now. You can apply
for a position as a butler.

247
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,069
You don't know everything, then?

248
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,669
Then will you tell me everything?

249
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,669
I'm afraid if I dare do,
Mrs Hughes, that...

250
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,269
it will shock and disgust you.

251
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,709
Shock and disgust? My, my.
I think I have to hear it now.

252
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,510
Come on.

253
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,429
Lady Grantham -
the dowager, that is...

254
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,590
has been concerned that your history
here has left you lonely.

255
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,430
She's kind to concern herself.
It's not just that.

256
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:23,190
She believes you've made this house
a local topic of unwelcome
conversation.

257
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,429
Ah.

258
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,349
So she's placed
an advertisement for you

259
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,230
and she's got some replies.

260
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,389
The point is, you would go to your
new position with references from me

261
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,949
and from Mrs Hughes

262
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,669
and you would not have to refer
to your earlier life.

263
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,190
In effect, you'd be washed clean.

264
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,629
Yes?

265
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,829
Is the new maid working out?
No, not really.

266
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,949
I don't think she'll stay.

267
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,469
I miss Anna.

268
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,549
What do you call her
now she's your maid?

269
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,589
Anna, I'm afraid.

270
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,710
I can't very well call her Bates.

271
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,269
No.

272
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,469
What's this about?

273
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,989
Well...

274
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,029
You know Matthew wants
to come with you to London.

275
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,789
Why shouldn't he?

276
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,349
I just need to check which train
you're planning to come back on.

277
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,750
The three o'clock on Thursday. Why?

278
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,789
Can you promise not to let him
catch an earlier one?

279
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,390
Of course not.
What reason would I give?

280
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,510
You can think of something.
Please.

281
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,509
Oh, all right.

282
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,990
But why is everything
always so complicated?

283
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:43,109
We'll talk about it when
Matthew's back from London.
Can't I have a clue?

284
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:47,069
He should tell you. It's his idea.
God, it sounds ominous. What does?

285
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,949
Matthew has some ghastly scheme for
the estate and Tom's too frightened
to say what it is.

286
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,950
I need a drink.

287
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,070
You cannot allow him
to blackmail you like this.

288
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,909
And before you ask,
Thomas has told me the whole story.

289
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,870
I'm only sorry you had to listen
to such horrors.

290
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,829
Why? Do you think Thomas
is the first man of... that sort
that I've ever come across?

291
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,669
Well, I would hope so.
Well, he isn't.

292
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,589
And I'll tell you something else.
I think James may have led him on.

293
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,949
What?!

294
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,429
I cannot listen to such allegations.
Calm down.

295
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,309
I don't mean deliberately,
but he's a vain and silly flirt.

296
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:32,549
He may have given Thomas the wrong
impression without meaning to.

297
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,709
I can hardly believe
we're having this conversation.

298
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,669
Maybe not, but I won't sit by
and let that young whippersnapper

299
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,269
ruin a man for the rest of his life.

300
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,589
Not a man who was wounded
in the service of king and country.

301
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,749
We may have no choice.

302
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,269
These practices, with which
you're apparently so familiar,

303
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,109
are against the law.

304
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,629
I know that.
Very well, then.

305
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:58,509
If we stand up to James
and he goes to the police,

306
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:02,630
it will only put Thomas in prison,
which he will not thank you for.

307
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,789
Inspecting the love nest?

308
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,790
Just fetching some coal.

309
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,549
I envy you.

310
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,469
Whatever you say.

311
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,470
No, I mean it.

312
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,430
The happy couple,
and everyone's so pleased for you.

313
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,869
Can't imagine what that's like.

314
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,110
Perhaps you should try being nicer.

315
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,429
It's being nice
that got me into trouble.

316
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,910
What do you mean?

317
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,150
Never mind.

318
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,389
I'll be gone soon.

319
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,190
And now you're here...

320
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,069
you'll be glad of that.

321
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,150
Yes, I will be.

322
00:21:26,896 --> 00:21:30,015
I assume I can count on you,
Mr Molesley.

323
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:33,256
Oh, I'll say. There's not much
I don't know about cricket.

324
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:35,776
You make me quite nervous.

325
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:40,593
So with you, me, James, Alfred,
both you hall boys,

326
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:42,793
that makes six from down here.

327
00:21:42,794 --> 00:21:45,313
I can't play, Mr Carson,
but I can keep score.

328
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:46,953
Good. Very good.

329
00:21:46,954 --> 00:21:52,593
So, with his lordship, Mr Crawley
and MR Branson, we're already ten.

330
00:21:52,594 --> 00:21:54,953
What about you, Mr Barrow?

331
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:56,713
I think I'll be gone by then.

332
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:59,034
Yes, you will.

333
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:07,273
Where's Mary? I was looking for her
but Anna said she'd gone out.

334
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:10,634
She's away for the night.
She'll be back tomorrow. Oh?

335
00:22:12,354 --> 00:22:15,193
Cora, is everything
as it should be between them?

336
00:22:15,194 --> 00:22:17,433
Between Mary and Matthew?

337
00:22:17,434 --> 00:22:18,873
Oh.

338
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:20,593
Yes, I think so. Why do you ask?

339
00:22:20,594 --> 00:22:25,473
Well, I find I'm rather impatient
to get the succession settled.

340
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:28,313
Robert, it's still early days.

341
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,353
Luncheon is served, my lady.

342
00:22:30,354 --> 00:22:32,113
Is it just us? Yes.

343
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:37,353
Tom's on the far side of the estate,
so he said he'd eat in the pub.
He's hiding from me.

344
00:22:37,354 --> 00:22:41,033
Until Matthew's told me the worst.
Probably.

345
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:46,513
May I take the opportunity
to bring your lordship up to date
with the team? Are we in good shape?

346
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:51,193
I reckon that with three family
players and seven from downstairs,
we're only one short.

347
00:22:51,194 --> 00:22:53,833
Two short. Branson won't play.

348
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:56,673
Mr Branson is busy at the moment.

349
00:22:56,674 --> 00:22:58,193
Is he, my lady?

350
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:00,273
Might I point out
that we're all busy,

351
00:23:00,274 --> 00:23:03,393
but we still find time
to support the honour of the house.

352
00:23:03,394 --> 00:23:07,073
Yes. But that is not
the right road to travel, Carson,

353
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:10,194
if we want to remain
in her ladyship's good graces.

354
00:23:16,914 --> 00:23:20,873
I know you all have
lots of things to do,
so just run about and do them.

355
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:25,833
I'll go and change.
But I thought we'd all have dinner
together and have a proper catch-up.

356
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,993
If you'd like, but please don't
let me be a nuisance. We could...

357
00:23:28,994 --> 00:23:33,433
I insist. A good family gossip
will be my payment in kind.

358
00:23:33,434 --> 00:23:37,594
Then of course we'd be delighted.
Good. We dine at half past eight.

359
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,354
Hello, operator?

360
00:23:57,194 --> 00:23:58,994
Knightsbridge 4056.

361
00:24:03,954 --> 00:24:07,553
I've been through those replies
to her ladyship's advertisement.

362
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:10,793
I don't think there's one
where I should be happier than here.

363
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,953
That's very flattering.

364
00:24:12,954 --> 00:24:15,514
There was a nice letter
from a Mrs Watson...

365
00:24:16,514 --> 00:24:18,553
but it was near Cheadle.

366
00:24:18,554 --> 00:24:22,633
Cheadle's very close to where
Mr and Mrs Bryant live. Oh, I see.

367
00:24:22,634 --> 00:24:26,113
And you feel that would
defeat the purpose

368
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:28,633
if the goal is
to leave your past behind you.

369
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:32,074
Don't you, ma'am?
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

370
00:24:33,074 --> 00:24:36,234
It's a pity if it was the only one
that was appealing.

371
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,834
So it looks as if
I'll be staying on.

372
00:24:43,074 --> 00:24:47,873
I'm sorry if it makes trouble
between you and the dowager.
Oh, don't worry about that.

373
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:52,394
If you'd gone, she'd have found some
other bone for us to fight over.

374
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:09,034
You look very pretty today.

375
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:14,353
I'm not sure how professional it is
of me to point that out.

376
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,554
Well, it's jolly nice of you.

377
00:25:18,554 --> 00:25:20,874
So, er... business!

378
00:25:22,194 --> 00:25:24,794
Now, I've read your piece.

379
00:25:26,514 --> 00:25:30,473
The plight of ex-soldiers is not an
obvious topic for a woman's column.

380
00:25:30,474 --> 00:25:32,193
I know it isn't very feminine,

381
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:35,833
but I felt so strongly about it,
I thought it was worth a try.

382
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:37,873
No, no, you misunderstand me.

383
00:25:37,874 --> 00:25:41,113
I like the idea of a woman taking
a position on a man's subject.

384
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:44,313
Don't be afraid of being serious
when it feels right.

385
00:25:44,314 --> 00:25:46,553
Really? Really.

386
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:49,473
No, I think
we're on to something new here.

387
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:51,873
The mature female voice in debate.

388
00:25:51,874 --> 00:25:56,273
I don't like the sound of "mature".
No. Erm...

389
00:25:56,274 --> 00:26:00,154
Balanced?
Yes. Let's go with "balanced".

390
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:05,313
Are you in town tonight and by any
chance looking for something to do?

391
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,473
I am, but sadly I'm spoken for.

392
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:10,314
That's a pity.

393
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:14,274
But you will let me know
when you're up in London again?

394
00:26:18,074 --> 00:26:20,553
Why are you bothering with Thomas?

395
00:26:20,554 --> 00:26:23,353
He's going. Good riddance.

396
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:26,994
I don't know.
Something he said.

397
00:26:27,994 --> 00:26:29,873
I feel funny taking his job.

398
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,913
You haven't taken his job.

399
00:26:31,914 --> 00:26:34,833
He filled in for you
while you were away, that's all.

400
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:36,234
Mm.

401
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:40,633
I might ask Mrs Hughes.
She usually knows what's going on.

402
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:41,993
Oh!

403
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:46,434
Which is more than YOU do.

404
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,554
Taxi!

405
00:26:59,834 --> 00:27:01,474
Warwick Square, please.

406
00:27:17,154 --> 00:27:18,954
Now I understand.

407
00:27:20,594 --> 00:27:23,474
You're not too shocked, then?
No.

408
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:28,033
But why is Mr Carson?
It's not as if none of us knew.

409
00:27:28,034 --> 00:27:31,793
I think the point is
we didn't know officially.

410
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:34,513
That's what Mr Carson finds hard.

411
00:27:34,514 --> 00:27:36,553
He can't avoid the subject
any longer

412
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,593
because it's lying there on the mat.

413
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:42,913
And he can't stand up to Jimmy?
He says he's powerless.

414
00:27:42,914 --> 00:27:46,033
And it's true we won't help Thomas
by putting him in prison.

415
00:27:46,034 --> 00:27:48,273
I wouldn't wish that on any man.

416
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:52,114
Imagine me
feeling sorry for Thomas.

417
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:55,514
Life is full of surprises.

418
00:27:57,954 --> 00:28:00,273
You don't think
we should have waited?

419
00:28:00,274 --> 00:28:04,913
No! Why should your delicious dinner
be spoiled just because Rose
forgot the time?

420
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,913
It's my fault. I shouldn't have
let her out of my sight.

421
00:28:07,914 --> 00:28:10,753
Nonsense. You had stuff to see to.

422
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:13,633
Talking of which,
how did you get on with your editor?

423
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,873
Oh. Quite well, I think.

424
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:19,753
How about you, Matthew?
I was only running errands.

425
00:28:19,754 --> 00:28:22,113
My main thing is tomorrow.

426
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:25,194
Mead, what is it?

427
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:27,233
Come on.

428
00:28:27,234 --> 00:28:31,993
This is the driver who took up Lady
Rose from outside the house, milady.

429
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:36,833
I came back because... she left
her scarf in the back of my cab.

430
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,633
How very good of you.

431
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,914
Go on. Tell them why they sent you
up to the dining room.

432
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:49,393
I know where she is, ma'am.
Your maid downstairs said
you might like to hear.

433
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,953
And she was right.
Where did she go?

434
00:28:51,954 --> 00:28:54,953
First to Warwick Square,

435
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:57,353
to pick up her... friend.

436
00:28:57,354 --> 00:28:59,793
And then you took her on somewhere?

437
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:04,594
Eventually. I was sat outside
for the best part of two hours.

438
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:09,513
How very expensive.

439
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:13,593
When they came out, they said
they wanted to go to a club.

440
00:29:13,594 --> 00:29:16,354
The Blue Dragon, on Greek Street.

441
00:29:16,994 --> 00:29:18,754
And what sort of club is that?

442
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:22,913
Well... You know.

443
00:29:22,914 --> 00:29:26,034
That's the point. I don't.

444
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:18,634
This is like the outer circle from
Dante's Inferno. The OUTER circle?

445
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:24,674
There she is.
Heavens, what a transformation!

446
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:33,033
And that, presumably,
is the friend she spent
two hours with in Warwick Square.

447
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:35,434
Let's not start down that track.

448
00:30:54,754 --> 00:30:56,554
Oh, my...!

449
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,833
How on earth did you find me?

450
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:02,433
How do you do?
I'm a cousin of Rose's mother.

451
00:31:02,434 --> 00:31:03,993
Lady Rosamund Painswick.

452
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:06,233
And this is Terence Margadale.

453
00:31:06,234 --> 00:31:08,433
How do you do? Please, sit down.

454
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,754
Can you bring some more glasses?

455
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:17,033
Tell me, where is MRS Margadale?
She's in the country, at the...

456
00:31:17,034 --> 00:31:19,473
Erm...

457
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:21,833
Er, Terence used to work for Daddy,

458
00:31:21,834 --> 00:31:24,233
so he's more of
a family friend, really.

459
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:27,153
Oh! So Cousin Shrimpie
will be pleased to hear about him?

460
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:29,074
No, please...
Why don't we dance?

461
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:45,353
Now look, I think I can get Rosamund
and Edith to keep their mouths shut

462
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:48,593
if you come with us now and have
nothing more to do with this man,

463
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,833
at least not until
you're out of our charge.

464
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:54,073
But he's... he's terribly unhappy,
and it's not his fault.

465
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:59,273
His wife is absolutely horrid.
Married men who wish to seduce young
women always have horrid wives.

466
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:03,113
I suggest you meet Mrs Margadale
before you come to any
final conclusions.

467
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:07,513
You're wrong. He's in love with me.
He wants to marry me as soon as
he can get a divorce.

468
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:09,473
And when will that be?

469
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:12,713
Well... it's terribly difficult.
Yes, I thought it might be.

470
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:18,153
Now, will you accept my conditions
or do I throw you to Lady Rosamund?

471
00:32:18,154 --> 00:32:20,793
Why are you helping me?

472
00:32:20,794 --> 00:32:23,754
I'm on the side of the downtrodden.

473
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:28,434
Excuse me.

474
00:32:31,274 --> 00:32:33,313
I rather like Warwick Square.

475
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:35,753
A sort of Belgravia
without the bustle.

476
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,593
We haven't been there very long.

477
00:32:37,594 --> 00:32:40,633
Rose is feeling rather tired
so we're leaving.

478
00:32:40,634 --> 00:32:42,314
Won't you at least stay for a...?

479
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:50,713
Well, no.
No, I'm glad she's staying.

480
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:53,153
But one forgets about parenthood.

481
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:55,113
The on-and-on-ness of it.

482
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:58,673
Were you a very involved mother
with Robert and Rosamund?

483
00:32:58,674 --> 00:33:01,313
Does it surprise you? A bit.

484
00:33:01,314 --> 00:33:04,633
I'd imagined them surrounded
by nannies and governesses,

485
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:08,634
being starched and ironed
to spend an hour with you after tea.

486
00:33:09,314 --> 00:33:13,554
Yes, but it was an hour every day.

487
00:33:14,554 --> 00:33:16,793
I see, yes.

488
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,873
How tiring.

489
00:33:18,874 --> 00:33:22,393
After the money turned up
from Mr Swire,

490
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:24,514
things went back to normal.

491
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:30,513
Mr Carson, may I have a word?

492
00:33:30,514 --> 00:33:32,514
I'll leave you. Just...

493
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:36,914
Well?

494
00:33:38,274 --> 00:33:40,953
When's Mr Barrow leaving?

495
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:42,354
I'm not sure.

496
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:46,873
He's lost his job. Why can't he
just go? I find it very awkward.

497
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:50,313
He made a mistake.
You're still in one piece.

498
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:53,634
Why do you have to be
such a big girl's blouse about it?

499
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:57,634
I'm sorry, Mr Carson,
but I won't change my mind.

500
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,874
I suppose you know
who's put him up to this, Mr Carson.

501
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,953
That Mr Bates is gobby, isn't he?

502
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,593
Why do you say that?

503
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:11,633
Everyone talked about him
as if he could walk on water,

504
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:13,153
but he's got a mouth on him.

505
00:34:13,154 --> 00:34:14,513
What did he say?

506
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:16,873
He was sticking up for Mr Barrow.

507
00:34:16,874 --> 00:34:19,993
Is this because of Mr Carson
not giving him a reference?

508
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:24,194
I don't think it's right. Do you?
Yes, I bloody well do
think it's right!

509
00:34:27,674 --> 00:34:29,474
You know nothing about it.

510
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,474
What's happened?

511
00:34:35,354 --> 00:34:37,153
What did I say?

512
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,193
I shouldn't get involved, dear.

513
00:34:39,194 --> 00:34:42,074
If you'll take my advice,
I should stay out of it.

514
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:51,273
Has there been
any progress with Ethel?

515
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:55,313
No. I'm sorry to disappoint you
but she doesn't want to go.

516
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:59,593
Not one of them was right?
One. A Mrs Watson.

517
00:34:59,594 --> 00:35:02,713
But the house was near
where the Bryants live.

518
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:05,513
And to be honest,
I suspect that was the reason.

519
00:35:05,514 --> 00:35:08,473
A chance to see little Charlie
from time to time.

520
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,113
Well, I can't blame her for that.
Of course not.

521
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:13,553
But the Bryants
would be bound to find out,

522
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:15,794
which would only lead
to more heartbreak.

523
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:23,633
I'll write to you as soon as I hear,

524
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:27,393
but it's extremely unlikely
there is anything wrong at all.

525
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:31,193
This may prove
an expensive journey for you.

526
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:34,554
May I ask you a question, Dr Ryder?

527
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,353
Has my wife been to see you?

528
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:39,633
I'm not aware of treating
a Mrs Crawley.

529
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:43,274
But even if I had, I could not
possibly comment on it. Of course.

530
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:48,073
It's only... I can't bear
to think of her being worried

531
00:35:48,074 --> 00:35:51,194
when I know very well that
if anyone's to blame, it's me.

532
00:35:51,874 --> 00:35:55,154
I'm not sure blame is
a very useful concept in this area.

533
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,593
Please believe me
that probability and logic

534
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:03,994
indicate a Crawley baby
yowling in its crib before too long.

535
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:07,314
Thank you.

536
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:09,954
Goodbye. Goodbye.

537
00:36:23,874 --> 00:36:25,874
Mrs Levenson for Dr Ryder.

538
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:35,338
This should buck you up.

539
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:44,497
Why did you go without saying,
when I knew all along it was me?

540
00:36:44,498 --> 00:36:46,218
You know nothing of the sort.

541
00:36:47,258 --> 00:36:50,738
In fact, it was me.

542
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,458
What do you mean?

543
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:57,938
There WAS something wrong,
with...

544
00:36:59,498 --> 00:37:03,177
Actually, I can't talk about
this sort of thing, even to you.

545
00:37:03,178 --> 00:37:06,138
You sound like Robert.
Well, I am his daughter.

546
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,897
The fact is...

547
00:37:09,898 --> 00:37:11,658
it meant a small operation.

548
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,177
What?

549
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:16,097
It's all right. It was weeks ago.

550
00:37:16,098 --> 00:37:19,658
That's why I've been keeping you
at arm's length.

551
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,738
I thought you'd gone off me.

552
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:30,577
Anyway, today was just to see
if all is well, and he says it is.

553
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:33,857
He says I'm to get in touch with him
in six months' time

554
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:36,178
but that I'll be pregnant
before then.

555
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:44,378
So... now we can start making babies.

556
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:51,858
I feel very guilty
not telling Susan about last night.

557
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,737
Mummy wouldn't understand.
Nor do I.

558
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,337
What were you thinking,

559
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:00,257
a respectable, well-born young woman
going out with a married man?

560
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:04,177
Rose knows it all depends on her
behaviour for the rest of her stay.

561
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:08,577
One false step
and I shall personally
telephone Lady Flintshire.

562
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,417
Very well.

563
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:11,898
But I don't approve.

564
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:41,458
Rose, you've obviously
read too many novels about young
women admired for their feistiness.

565
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,737
Do you think they will keep quiet?

566
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:49,577
I expect so, as long as you
stick to your side of the bargain.

567
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:53,097
Even Cousin Rosamund? She didn't like
being made to keep the secret.

568
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:56,338
Probably because she knows
that Granny will be furious.

569
00:39:06,538 --> 00:39:08,577
You see? How I turn it,

570
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:10,297
first this way,

571
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:11,698
and now that.

572
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:17,817
Alfred, what's the matter?

573
00:39:17,818 --> 00:39:20,417
I'm not easy
about this business with Mr Barrow.

574
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:23,257
Well, why not take a turn
with Mr Moseley's bat?

575
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:25,178
That'll put a smile on your face.

576
00:39:27,258 --> 00:39:30,857
Is Mr Carson really
not giving Mr Barrow a reference?

577
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:33,217
What will he do
if he hasn't got a reference?

578
00:39:33,218 --> 00:39:37,577
He could always go abroad. He might
do well in America, Mr Barrow.

579
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:41,618
Seems a bit drastic. Why should he
go abroad? Keep your nose out of it.

580
00:39:44,898 --> 00:39:49,818
Why won't someone
tell us what's going on?
Because you wouldn't understand it.

581
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:52,138
I very much hope.

582
00:39:53,378 --> 00:39:56,697
Why didn't Carson tell me?
He's the one who's being undermined.

583
00:39:56,698 --> 00:40:00,937
It's a very difficult subject
for him to discuss. I can imagine.

584
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:03,857
But it's not as if
we didn't all know about Barrow.

585
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:06,137
That's what I said to Mrs Hughes.

586
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:12,177
If I shouted blue murder every time
someone tried to kiss me at Eton,
I'd have gone hoarse in a month.

587
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:16,017
What a tiresome fellow.
It's not the boy's fault, my lord.

588
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:19,857
He's been whipped up,
told if he doesn't see it through,

589
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:22,497
we'd all suspect him
of batting for the same team.

590
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,457
Crikey! But who'd do that?

591
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:26,377
Who's got it in for Barrow?

592
00:40:26,378 --> 00:40:27,897
Miss O'Brien.

593
00:40:27,898 --> 00:40:31,177
O'Brien? I thought
they were as thick as thieves.

594
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,138
Not now, my lord.

595
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:39,337
Now, I've spoken to your mother.

596
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:41,817
She has a new plan
for when you leave here.

597
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:46,778
But aren't I going back to London?
Oh, no. It's so horrid and dusty.

598
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,537
What is Mummy's plan?

599
00:40:49,538 --> 00:40:53,577
They're opening Duneagle early.
You're to go there.

600
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:57,578
On my own? No. Your Aunt Agatha
will keep you company.

601
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:01,657
Alone in Scotland with Aunt Agatha?

602
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:03,257
She can't be serious.

603
00:41:03,258 --> 00:41:07,457
I know. Lady Agatha isn't
much of a party person, I admit.

604
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:11,137
This is all because I went up
to London to see Terence, isn't it?

605
00:41:11,138 --> 00:41:13,778
How did she find out?
Who gave me away?

606
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,097
I don't know who Terence is.

607
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:20,977
Of course. It's not your fault,
Aunt Violet. But they promised...

608
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,497
Don't shoot the messenger. I'm only
relaying your mother's orders.

609
00:41:24,498 --> 00:41:28,538
You're to stay for the cricket match
and head north the next day.

610
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:31,217
Perhaps I'll run away.

611
00:41:31,218 --> 00:41:33,137
Not this time.

612
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:34,857
My maid will travel with you

613
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:37,257
so you have someone to talk to
on the journey.

614
00:41:37,258 --> 00:41:39,657
I won't be held a prisoner forever.

615
00:41:39,658 --> 00:41:42,418
No. One day you'll be older
and out of our power.

616
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:45,978
But not yet.

617
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,898
Prison's changed you.

618
00:41:54,818 --> 00:41:59,217
There was a time when
nothing was too bad for me
as far as you were concerned.

619
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:01,257
Prison HAS changed me.

620
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:03,457
You do know Miss O'Brien
is behind it?

621
00:42:03,458 --> 00:42:05,458
I knew someone was.

622
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:08,977
Jimmy'd never think of it
for himself.

623
00:42:08,978 --> 00:42:12,017
Doesn't it bother you
that she'll get away with it?

624
00:42:12,018 --> 00:42:13,537
Not really.

625
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:15,577
Without a reference,

626
00:42:15,578 --> 00:42:18,457
after ten years here,

627
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,217
you'll never work again.

628
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,018
Not in England.

629
00:42:23,338 --> 00:42:25,257
But elsewhere maybe.

630
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:28,098
A cousin in Bombay. I might go there.

631
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:30,977
I like the sun.

632
00:42:30,978 --> 00:42:34,497
You must know something about Miss
O'Brien you can use against her.

633
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:38,738
You've heard of the phrase
"to know when you're beaten"?

634
00:42:39,258 --> 00:42:42,177
Well, I'm beaten, Mr Bates.

635
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:44,378
I'm well and truly beaten.

636
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:48,137
Then give me the weapon
and I'll do the work.

637
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:51,178
What can I say
that will make her change her mind?

638
00:42:57,298 --> 00:42:59,337
It is not how we do things!

639
00:42:59,338 --> 00:43:02,697
Many of the farmers' families have
been at Downton as long as we have.

640
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:06,417
We need to see
more profits from the farm!
Here we go. Profit, profit, profit!

641
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,617
We cannot go forward with no income.

642
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:10,857
But why not tackle it gradually?

643
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,137
Perhaps buy some time
by investing your capital.

644
00:43:14,138 --> 00:43:18,497
I hear of schemes daily that'll
double whatever's put into them,
or treble it, or more.

645
00:43:18,498 --> 00:43:21,097
Many offer high rewards.
Very few deliver them.

646
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,697
There's a chap in America, er...
Charles Ponzi,

647
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:26,217
who offers a huge return
after 90 days.

648
00:43:26,218 --> 00:43:28,417
Harry Stoke has gone in
with a bundle...

649
00:43:28,418 --> 00:43:31,857
Then Harry Stoke, whoever he is,
is a fool. But if I could find out...

650
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:36,057
Last time you took an interest in
investment, you ruined the family!
Now look here!

651
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:39,537
As captain of this ship,
Robert's entitled to some respect.

652
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:43,257
He didn't mean any disrespect. He
does a marvellous impression of it.

653
00:43:43,258 --> 00:43:45,697
We're giving the farmers a choice,
that's all.

654
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:49,617
If they sell,
the larger units will let us meet
the challenges of the modern world.

655
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:54,337
We need to build something
that will last, not stand by
and watch it crumble into dust.

656
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,177
What about the tenants?!

657
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:59,577
What about the men and women
who put their trust in us?

658
00:43:59,578 --> 00:44:02,177
Is this fair to them?
I don't believe so.

659
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:05,217
But isn't the most important thing
for them, or us,

660
00:44:05,218 --> 00:44:08,818
to maintain Downton
as a source of employment?

661
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:11,978
So you're against me too?

662
00:44:13,538 --> 00:44:18,537
It seems to me your plan adds up to
carrying on as if nothing's changed,

663
00:44:18,538 --> 00:44:21,457
to spend Matthew's money
keeping up the illusion,

664
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,537
then, when we've fallen into
a bottomless pit of debt,
we'll sell up and go.

665
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,938
So yes, I believe Matthew is right.

666
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:30,338
I see.

667
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:34,978
You seem to be agreed that
there's no place for me in all this.

668
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:39,178
So obviously it's time for me
to take a back seat.

669
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:52,778
Hello. Is that the Daily Telegraph
information desk?

670
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:57,457
I want to find out
about a London editor.

671
00:44:57,458 --> 00:44:59,978
Michael Gregson, of the Sketch.

672
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:04,577
Just some general stuff.

673
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:08,617
His education,
what he's done since then.

674
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:12,138
And... a little
about his private life.

675
00:45:21,698 --> 00:45:23,617
But why here?

676
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:26,657
I don't like the idea
of her being our first visitor.

677
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:28,977
I want to be away from the others.

678
00:45:28,978 --> 00:45:33,937
I don't know why you're doing this.
You don't even like Thomas.

679
00:45:33,938 --> 00:45:36,698
Because I know what it is
to feel powerless.

680
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:42,018
To see a life slide away and there's
nothing you can do to stop it.

681
00:45:44,338 --> 00:45:46,817
Quite the orator.

682
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:49,858
Have you thought about
standing for Parliament?

683
00:46:02,738 --> 00:46:05,777
Oh, yes. Very nice.

684
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:08,578
It'll be even better
with a bit of money spent on it.

685
00:46:09,698 --> 00:46:11,737
Can I get you some tea?

686
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:13,577
If I'm staying long enough.

687
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:16,537
I don't know what it is
Mr Bates wants to see me about.

688
00:46:16,538 --> 00:46:19,298
You'll have time for tea.

689
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,137
Will that be all, ma'am?
There is one thing.

690
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:34,577
There was a letter delivered by hand
this afternoon.

691
00:46:34,578 --> 00:46:38,417
It's from the dowager. She wants us
to call on her in the morning.

692
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:42,218
But why would she want ME? No doubt
we'll find out in the morning.

693
00:46:44,778 --> 00:46:48,818
Well, I am surprised to find
that you're a fan Mr Oscar Wilde.

694
00:46:49,658 --> 00:46:53,177
You've known about Mr Barrow
all along, so what's changed now?

695
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:55,457
Perhaps I've come to my senses.

696
00:46:55,458 --> 00:46:58,417
You mean you've found a way
to be even nastier than usual.

697
00:46:58,418 --> 00:47:00,697
Get back in the knife box,
Miss Sharp.

698
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:04,457
I want you to persuade Jimmy
to let Mr Barrow have a reference

699
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,898
so when he leaves here
he can start again.

700
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:09,938
Why would Jimmy listen to me?

701
00:47:11,298 --> 00:47:14,458
I won't do it.
I think you will.

702
00:47:27,138 --> 00:47:29,497
I'm going.
Sort it out by this evening.

703
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:33,258
Or? Or you'll find your secret
is no longer safe with me.

704
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:43,077
I'm just saying
I think you've made your point.

705
00:47:43,078 --> 00:47:46,157
To let it go now would be
the gentlemanly thing to do.

706
00:47:46,158 --> 00:47:48,357
You said that if I let it go

707
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:50,677
they'd think I was
up to the same thing,

708
00:47:50,678 --> 00:47:52,638
that I wasn't a proper man.

709
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,718
If you'd done nothing, yes.

710
00:47:56,678 --> 00:48:02,878
But this way you'll come across as
merciful and not vindictive.
Do you see?

711
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:06,677
I never wanted to push it this far.

712
00:48:06,678 --> 00:48:09,278
Then you'll be glad to stop it.

713
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:12,477
You're sure I won't
be made to look a fool?

714
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:14,717
Far from it.

715
00:48:14,718 --> 00:48:18,277
I think they'll hold you higher
in their estimation.

716
00:48:18,278 --> 00:48:20,677
Ah, James. Upstairs, please.

717
00:48:20,678 --> 00:48:24,398
May I have a word with you, please,
Mr Carson, before we go up?

718
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,437
But why London?
You've only just got back.

719
00:48:37,438 --> 00:48:40,717
I've had some bad news, that's all.
What sort of bad news?

720
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,077
Never mind. It's not our business.

721
00:48:43,078 --> 00:48:46,438
How's the cricket team coming along?
We're still two short.

722
00:48:47,118 --> 00:48:49,477
And you're still determined
not to play?

723
00:48:49,478 --> 00:48:52,837
It's not that I WON'T play.
I CAN'T play. I don't know how.

724
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:54,477
Stop twisting his arm.

725
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:57,957
Any news on the move, Tom? We're
going to miss you both so much.

726
00:48:57,958 --> 00:49:02,157
You told Matthew
not to twist his arm.
Now you're doing exactly the same.

727
00:49:02,158 --> 00:49:06,198
I just think children are happier
in families. I'm sorry but I do.

728
00:49:07,438 --> 00:49:09,558
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

729
00:49:10,758 --> 00:49:14,597
But I suppose Barrow
will have to go.

730
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,437
My lord?

731
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,389
He's so good at cricket.

732
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,190
I know we were soundly beaten last
year, but he got most of our runs.

733
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:27,469
I thought we just wanted him to have
a reference so he could find work
when he leaves.

734
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:31,469
I know, but now that I think
about it, Carson ought to
insist that he stays on.

735
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,989
He needs to re-establish
his authority over James.

736
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,469
Couldn't Mr Barrow just stay
till after the match and then go?

737
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:42,310
That seems rather unkind.
Wouldn't we be using him?

738
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,749
He might not want to stay, my lord,
after the unpleasantness.

739
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,549
I think he will.

740
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,310
But don't forget the cricket.

741
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,750
I won't, my lord.

742
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:00,589
See how my grip is firm,

743
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,229
but tender.

744
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:04,430
Cherish the ball. Don't crush it.

745
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,389
Right. Gabriel, have a try.

746
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,829
Is it true you've given in
and let Mr Barrow get away with it?

747
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,269
It was dragging on and on. At least
this way we'll be rid of him.

748
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:20,189
I heard his lordship wants him
to stay for the cricket match.
It won't be for much longer.

749
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,229
Then he'll get his reference and go.

750
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,030
And good riddance.

751
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,069
I'm... going over to Windmill Farm,

752
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:37,869
to see what we can do
with the outbuildings.

753
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,710
Would you like to come with me?
I'm sure you can manage on your own.

754
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,430
Aren't you going?
I'll meet him there later.

755
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:55,389
He's putting a good face on it,

756
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,509
but you know he wants you with him
on this, more than anything.

757
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:01,109
I should not serve him well.

758
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,029
I don't have the instincts
for what he wants to do.

759
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:07,910
You mean you're not a tradesman?
Your word, not mine.

760
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,230
Shall I tell you how I look at it?

761
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,789
Every man or woman
who marries into this house,
every child born into it,

762
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:19,229
has to put their gifts
at the family's disposal.

763
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,309
I'm a hard worker,
and I've some knowledge of the land.

764
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,189
Matthew knows the law and the nature
of business. Which I do not.

765
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:29,829
You understand the responsibilities
we owe to the people round here,

766
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,469
those who work for the estate
and those that don't.

767
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:36,309
It seems to me if we could manage
to pool all of that,

768
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,869
if we each do what we can do,

769
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,710
then Downton has a real chance.

770
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:44,589
You're very eloquent.

771
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:48,029
You're a good spokesman
for Matthew's vision.

772
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:50,589
Better than he has been recently.

773
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:53,070
So you'll give us your backing?

774
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:58,110
I'll think about it.

775
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:01,350
On one condition.

776
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,470
You play cricket for the house.

777
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:11,150
We all have to do what we can do.

778
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,790
For God's sake,
if it means that much to you.

779
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,029
Oh!

780
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:33,029
You didn't expect to find ME here.
No.

781
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:36,269
I thought the only person
who could tell us with any accuracy

782
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,389
the Bryants' response
to Ethel's working nearby

783
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,189
were the Bryants themselves.

784
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,309
Lady Grantham wrote to me
explaining your wish.

785
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:48,109
Well... it was only that Mrs Watson
had answered the advertisement...

786
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,429
I know the circumstances.

787
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:54,269
Just as I know that you would like
to see how Charlie's getting on.

788
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:57,109
As it happens,
I've been uncomfortable

789
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,309
about keeping a mother from her son.

790
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,149
Although I would not want to confuse
him until he's much older, if then...

791
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,509
You wouldn't have to confuse him.
I've already worked it out.

792
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,469
I'm his old nanny, employed by you
when he was first born.

793
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:14,390
But what about when he talks about
you to Mr Bryant? You will please
leave Mr Bryant to me.

794
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:20,349
Now, Ethel, you must write to
Mrs Watson today and get it settled.

795
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,790
And I'll be able to see Charlie!

796
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,869
It won't be easy.

797
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,310
It'll be easier than not seeing him.

798
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,110
Very much easier.

799
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:40,830
And if Mr Barrow is to stay on,
what would he be? My valet?

800
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:46,589
You can make him under-butler. Then
your dinners will be grand enough
for Chu Chin Chow.

801
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,229
And he can apply to be a butler
when he does leave.

802
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,629
But that would make him my superior.

803
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:55,349
Oh, I don't know. Under-butler,
head valet. There's not much in it.

804
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,229
The question remains,

805
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,949
how do we convince James?

806
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:01,789
Well...

807
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:06,029
It's his lordship
who wants Mr Barrow to stay on,

808
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,990
so I think his lordship
can bring it about.

809
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,110
Is this worth it?

810
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:19,430
I've no time to learn anything.

811
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,829
Couldn't I just trust
to beginner's luck? Certainly not.

812
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,829
I want you to profit
from my skills in gratitude
for bringing Robert round.

813
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,750
Not completely. Not yet.

814
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,030
Elbow up.

815
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,189
You won't make a gentleman of me,
you know.

816
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,549
You can teach me to fish, ride
and shoot, but I'd still be
an Irish Mick in my heart.

817
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,390
So I should hope.

818
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,230
There! See?
You're getting the hang of it.

819
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,589
I'm sorry if this is inconvenient.

820
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:58,469
It's unexpected, not inconvenient.

821
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,790
I suppose I'd better just say it.

822
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,990
Please do.

823
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:10,630
I had the impression on my last visit
that you were flirting.

824
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,430
Giving signs
that you found me attractive.

825
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:17,469
If I'm wrong, then I apologise.

826
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,710
You're not wrong.

827
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:25,510
But since then I have discovered
that you are, in fact, married.

828
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,830
Yes.

829
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:34,829
I'm afraid I find the idea
of a married man flirting
with me wholly repugnant.

830
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,309
So I must hand in
my resignation at once.

831
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:40,989
No. It's true, I am married, but
I hope you'll allow me to explain.

832
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,629
Explain what? I am familiar
with the institution of marriage.

833
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:48,190
Yes, but not with this one.

834
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,789
My wife is in an asylum,
and she has been for some years.

835
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,230
Lizzie was a wonderful person.
I loved her very much.

836
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:59,030
It took me a long time to accept
that the woman I knew was gone...

837
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,509
and wouldn't be coming back.

838
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:05,309
Then why haven't you got a divorce?

839
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,949
I can't. A... lunatic
is not deemed responsible.

840
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:12,270
She's neither the guilty
nor the innocent party.

841
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:20,190
It means that I'm... tied
for the rest of my life to a...

842
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,709
a madwoman,

843
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:26,510
who doesn't even know me.

844
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:31,189
I can't begin to tell you how much
it cheers me to read your column

845
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:34,150
and to meet when we do.

846
00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,790
I hope very much
you'll consider staying on.

847
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:53,359
Heads.
Ah. Well, there we are.

848
00:57:00,463 --> 00:57:01,983
Yes!

849
00:57:07,743 --> 00:57:10,182
I'm glad everything's settled
with Ethel,

850
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:13,702
but I trust you can find another
cook without too much difficulty.

851
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:16,102
Preferably one
with a blameless record

852
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:21,182
so my house ceases to be
a topic of gossip, which is
really what this is all about.

853
00:57:21,183 --> 00:57:25,542
Well, if Ethel wants to be part of
her son's life, even a little part,

854
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:27,302
who are we to stand in her way?

855
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:32,062
If you'd had to sell Charlie
to the butcher to be chopped up
as stew to achieve the same ends,

856
00:57:32,063 --> 00:57:33,702
you would have done so.

857
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:35,903
Well, happily it was not needed.

858
00:57:41,974 --> 00:57:43,454
Howzat!

859
00:58:12,658 --> 00:58:13,818
Well shot, sir!

860
00:58:18,338 --> 00:58:20,898
Well played, Barrow. Thank you.
Excellent innings.

861
00:58:21,858 --> 00:58:24,937
I thought I was helping him
get out of our lives for good.

862
00:58:24,938 --> 00:58:27,177
Now he ranks higher than I do.

863
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:29,138
I've been a damned fool.

864
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:35,018
By the way, what was that phrase
he gave you to say to Miss O'Brien?

865
00:58:35,738 --> 00:58:37,617
You can tell me now, surely.

866
00:58:37,618 --> 00:58:40,337
If you keep it under your hat.

867
00:58:40,338 --> 00:58:42,977
It was "her ladyship's soap".
What?

868
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,497
I can't make any sense of it either,
but that's what he said.

869
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:48,378
"Her ladyship's soap."

870
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:51,458
And it worked.

871
00:58:54,218 --> 00:58:57,257
It's down to you, Molesley,
last man in.

872
00:58:57,258 --> 00:59:00,777
We're in good shape thanks to Barrow,
but we could do with a bonus.

873
00:59:00,778 --> 00:59:04,017
Don't worry, I'll show them
a thing or two. That's the spirit.

874
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:07,417
Well done, Papa. I did my best.
We'll just have to hope it's enough.

875
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:11,178
Anna says we are to expect
great things of Molesley. Ah.

876
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:20,658
Out!

877
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,138
Well bowled.

878
00:59:27,378 --> 00:59:30,697
As usual, our expectations
are disappointed.

879
00:59:30,698 --> 00:59:32,098
Let's have some tea!

880
00:59:33,618 --> 00:59:35,537
Who gave me away?

881
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:37,257
Was it you? Certainly not!

882
00:59:37,258 --> 00:59:41,658
In case you don't know,
I'm being sent north tomorrow
with a monster for a jailer!

883
00:59:42,858 --> 00:59:44,577
Well, what did she expect,

884
00:59:44,578 --> 00:59:48,417
carrying on with a married man
as if her home were in a tree?

885
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,058
Granny, who told you?

886
00:59:51,058 --> 00:59:53,977
How could you have done that,
after you promised?

887
00:59:53,978 --> 00:59:56,817
But Mama said YOU told her.
I just filled in the details.

888
00:59:56,818 --> 00:59:58,297
I never said a word!

889
00:59:58,298 --> 01:00:01,337
Have you tricked me, Mama?
Tricked? I'm not a conjurer.

890
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:07,097
I only did what was necessary to
preserve the honour of the family.
In other words, you tricked me.

891
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:08,818
James!

892
01:00:09,658 --> 01:00:13,857
You put up a very good show out
there. Well done. Thank you, m'lord.

893
01:00:13,858 --> 01:00:18,057
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to thank you
for your generosity with Barrow.

894
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:20,897
Letting him stay on
shows a real largeness of spirit.

895
01:00:20,898 --> 01:00:22,457
Stay on?

896
01:00:22,458 --> 01:00:25,137
Mr Barrow's staying on?
As under-butler.

897
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:27,657
I was given the impression
you'd allowed it.

898
01:00:27,658 --> 01:00:30,657
I allowed him to have
a decent reference when he left.

899
01:00:30,658 --> 01:00:32,977
But you won't mind too much,
will you?

900
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:37,097
Oh, by the way, congratulations
on your appointment as first footman.

901
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:38,338
What?

902
01:00:39,338 --> 01:00:41,538
Thank you, m'lord. Very much.

903
01:00:58,898 --> 01:01:00,697
Lord Grantham, I believe.

904
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,977
The same.

905
01:01:01,978 --> 01:01:04,178
Looking for a Mr Alfred Nugent,
my lord.

906
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:09,698
And you are...? Inspector Stanford
and Sergeant Brand, York Police.

907
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:14,337
Alfred can't have got into trouble
with the police. That's not possible.

908
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:17,457
He's made a complaint
concerning a Mr Thomas Barrow,

909
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:22,497
making an assault of a... criminal
nature on another of your employees.

910
01:01:22,498 --> 01:01:24,697
That is a very serious allegation.

911
01:01:24,698 --> 01:01:28,337
Serious enough to bring us here
to interrupt your cricket match.

912
01:01:28,338 --> 01:01:32,217
If you'd point out
the young gentleman.
He's over... I'll fetch him.

913
01:01:32,218 --> 01:01:35,777
We'll go with you. I think it's
better to leave it to his lordship.

914
01:01:35,778 --> 01:01:37,898
I'm sure he can get
to the bottom of it.

915
01:01:39,938 --> 01:01:42,457
But I know what I saw,
and it weren't right.

916
01:01:42,458 --> 01:01:45,497
I'm not asking you to abandon
your beliefs, Alfred,

917
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:48,337
just to introduce a little kindness
into the equation.

918
01:01:48,338 --> 01:01:51,777
Am I not to stand up against evil?
Evil?

919
01:01:51,778 --> 01:01:54,577
Thomas does not choose
to be the way he is.

920
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:58,538
And what harm was done, really, that
his life should be destroyed for it?

921
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,217
Well... Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

922
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:05,258
Are you without sin, Alfred?
For I am certainly not.

923
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:11,857
Sorry about your son, Mr Molesley.
Don't be.

924
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:16,897
He talks such a lovely game. He could
always talk a good game of cricket.

925
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:18,898
He just couldn't play it.

926
01:02:19,818 --> 01:02:23,137
Just as I thought.
There's been a mix-up.

927
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:27,937
Alfred here witnessed
some rough-housing between two
of the staff and misinterpreted it.

928
01:02:27,938 --> 01:02:32,018
Why did you make the telephone call
without checking your facts?

929
01:02:32,578 --> 01:02:37,178
I'm very much afraid to say he was
a bit squiffy. Weren't you, Alfred?

930
01:02:39,978 --> 01:02:43,337
I made the call
before I knew what I were doing.

931
01:02:43,338 --> 01:02:45,377
I'd been at the cider.
You'd what?!

932
01:02:45,378 --> 01:02:48,057
Oh, I think we can
overlook it this once.

933
01:02:48,058 --> 01:02:49,858
Don't you, Carson?

934
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:57,697
So there's nothing to investigate.
I'm terribly sorry to have wasted
your time.

935
01:02:57,698 --> 01:02:59,338
Would you care to have some tea?

936
01:02:59,978 --> 01:03:03,617
No, thank you, Lord Grantham.
I think we've got the measure of it.

937
01:03:03,618 --> 01:03:05,618
Good luck with your match.

938
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,457
Where is Nanny?

939
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,497
Gone to get some baby paraphernalia.

940
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:36,857
Shall I tell her
you're looking for her?

941
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:38,338
No.

942
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:41,298
No, I'll be here anyway.

943
01:03:51,258 --> 01:03:53,418
You're very good to play.

944
01:03:54,538 --> 01:03:57,538
I don't know why
I made such a fuss about it.

945
01:03:59,858 --> 01:04:02,938
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

946
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:08,057
If I were to say I'd live with you
while Sybbie's little,

947
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:11,577
and that we wouldn't move out
until she's older,

948
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:14,258
would you mind?
I should be delighted.

949
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,538
And I know
it's what Sybil would want.

950
01:04:19,338 --> 01:04:21,778
I think you're right.

951
01:04:26,938 --> 01:04:29,697
Tom says Robert's ready
to get behind the plan.

952
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:31,537
I'm glad.

953
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:36,137
So we'll be building a new kingdom
while we make our little prince.

954
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:38,537
I'm looking forward to both
enormously.

955
01:04:38,538 --> 01:04:40,898
Right, gentlemen! Time's up!

956
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:43,658
We're about to start again.

957
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:46,577
I hope I can count on you
not to laugh when I drop the ball.

958
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:48,858
You can always count on me.

959
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,258
I know that.

960
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:54,897
I didn't think it was possible
to love as much as I love you.

961
01:04:54,898 --> 01:04:57,657
Matthew, hurry up!
You're keeping everyone waiting!

962
01:04:57,658 --> 01:05:00,898
I've got to go.
Of course you have.

963
01:05:17,218 --> 01:05:20,137
Tom seems to think
you might be coming round.

964
01:05:20,138 --> 01:05:23,737
Well, he's brought me round,
more like, but yes.

965
01:05:23,738 --> 01:05:25,497
All right.

966
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:28,338
Let's give it a go
and see what the future brings.

967
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:31,138
Thank you.

968
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:48,778
Catch it!

969
01:05:58,218 --> 01:06:00,018
Great stuff.

970
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:06,640

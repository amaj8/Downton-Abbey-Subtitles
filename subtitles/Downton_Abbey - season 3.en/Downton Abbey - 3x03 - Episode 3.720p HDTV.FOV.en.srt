2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,645
Oh. Hello, Edith, dear. 

3
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,005
Hello, Granny. Isn't it exciting?

4
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
At my age one must ration
one's excitement. 

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,520
I told her everything would come
right but she wouldn't believe me. 

6
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,445
I still can't. 

7
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,360
Something happening in this house is
actually about me. 

8
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:21,045
The dress came this morning. 

9
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,668
I was sad you decided against Pat,
too. I would've paid. 

10
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,920
Lucille was safer. We don't want her
to look like a chorus girl. 

11
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,325
- How's Anthony? Excited, I hope. 
- Desperately. 

12
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,885
Just when he thought his life
would never change,

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
- he's going back to the beginning. 
- What an invigorating prospect!

14
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,365
I hope you've got
your shirt ready for tonight. 

15
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,325
In case you're interested, I've hidden a 
couple so I won't be caught out that way again. 

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,146
- Why should I be interested?
- That goes for you, too. 

17
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,085
- Me?
- Take no notice. 

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,325
Anna, are the flowers done?

19
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,180
Yes, I'll check them on Saturday
and lose any that's going over. 

20
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:04,000
I've kept back a few in bud. I'll be
home for the dressing gong. 

21
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:05,885
We'll manage. 

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,000
Still no word from the doctor?

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,525
I'd have told you if there was. 

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,840
They don't mind stringing it out. 
Shall we got and see him?

25
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,760
Why? I'm sure if he knew anything
he would've said. 

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,960
How are you today, Mr Molesley?

27
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,845
Very well, thank you. 

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,920
You were talking the other night
about your friend's daughter. 

29
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:34,165
- Is she still looking for a place?
- She is. 

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,045
You read about the servant shortage
in the newspapers

31
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,120
but you can't find a situation
for a lady's maid. Not one. 

32
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,871
She'll end up as a house maid
if she's not careful. 

33
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:49,480
We can't have that. If I were
to tell you something,

34
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:52,337
promise not to breathe
a word downstairs. 

35
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,160
Miss O'Brien doesn't want
anyone to know. 

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,800
How will they advertise it?

37
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,800
I don't know exactly. 

38
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,045
Desirable nobleman's mansion

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,405
with surrounding estate
and properties. 

40
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,600
- Where will you go? 
- We have land on the border with Durham. 

41
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,605
It came with my great grandmother. 

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,993
The house is pretty,
we might make something of it. 

43
00:03:20,274 --> 00:03:24,280
- We could rename it Downton Place. 
- Who lives there now?

44
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:26,725
A tenant but we can come
to an arrangement. 

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,960
Let's take a picnic there tomorrow
on Edith's last day of freedom. 

46
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:34,285
Molesley's in the hall. He wonders
if you mind have a word?

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,800
- I'll come through in a minute. 
- Not with you, with Mama. 

48
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:40,040
Molesley. 

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,640
Your Ladyship, may I have a word?

50
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:48,360
Of course. 

51
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,960
My Lady, might I be allowed
to put forward a candidate

52
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:56,765
- as Miss O'Brien's replacement? 
- What?

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,120
- When the time comes. 
- Is O'Brien leaving?

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,725
I hope I've not spoken out of turn,

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,520
only I didn't want to miss
the chance. I thought you knew. 

56
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:10,960
Of course I know, thank you. 
I'll be happy to listen

57
00:04:10,995 --> 00:04:13,760
to recommendations
when, as you say, the time comes. 

58
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,080
Thank you, My Lady. 

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,765
Well, I must confess, I'll watch her
departure with mixed emotions. 

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,908
- Mine are fairly unmixed.
- Did you have a clue? 

61
00:04:25,844 --> 00:04:27,841
Not a clue. 

62
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:29,165
How very disappointing. 

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,560
But in a way it raises the big question
when do we tell the staff

64
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:36,000
- that the end is nigh?
- It sounds so final. 

65
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,285
I'm afraid it is final. 

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,365
Well, don't spoil Edith's stay. 

67
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,520
Let's get through the wedding first
then tell them afterwards. 

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
Oh, Dr Clarkson. 

69
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,820
- Do you have a minute?
- Er, one minute, yes. 

70
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:56,880
- Do you mind if we... 
- Only I know Mrs Hughes

71
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,005
is suffering from a condition

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
and I wondered if there's anything
I can do to help?

73
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,405
You can help
by lessening her duties. 

74
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,400
- But you can't tell me how serious it is?
- I'm afraid not. 

75
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:11,720
Even if I knew, which I don't... 

76
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:13,445
yet. 

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Good day to you, Mr Carson. 

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,760
I had a telephone call
from Charkham earlier. 

79
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,645
- Charkham?
- Reggie Swire's lawyer. 

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,165
It seems the death certificate
has arrived from India. 

81
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,418
- He wants to bring it here. 
- Why can't he send it? 

82
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:31,361
He wants to bring it. 

83
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,365
He was quite definite. 

84
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
I told him to come tomorrow. 
There's nothing going on, is there?

85
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:39,317
You know there is,
we're taking a picnic

86
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:42,245
to see the house
we have to move into. 

87
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,020
I'm surprised you, of all people,
can forget that. 

88
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:49,760
He's coming in the morning,
I won't put him off. 

89
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:53,920
This is the moment when you receive a
huge fortune that could save Downton

90
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,960
and you give it away?

91
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,885
- Will you choose where to give it?
- How can I? I'd give it to Papa!

92
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,372
I hope in some small part of you you
can understand. 

93
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,801
I'm trying, really I am.

94
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,680
But I can't pretend
I'm doing very well. 

95
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,480
Will there be anything more,
My Lady?

96
00:06:15,515 --> 00:06:17,200
No. 

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,200
Unless you have something
you want to tell me. 

98
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,245
What might that be, My Lady?

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,760
I won't prompt you, O'Brien,
if you're not ready to say. 

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,720
- Did she tell you why?
- No. 

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,325
Maybe she doesn't want until she settles

102
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,445
where she's going
but she has let me down. 

103
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,120
We should go. Strallan won't be late. 
He never is, worse luck.

104
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:53,445
I know you're not happy,

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,765
but Edith will be
in the same county. 

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Loxley's a nice house, the estate
will give her plenty to do. 

107
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:02,857
She'll be a nurse
and by the time she's 50

108
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:05,880
she'll be wheeling round
a one-arm OLD man. 

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,454
Are you waiting down here 'til they come
in search of the pudding?

110
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:12,450
 No, Mrs Patmore.

111
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,280
- Can I do something for you?
- I'd better get back upstairs,

112
00:07:22,315 --> 00:07:24,840
but, um, while you're here,

113
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,640
I saw Dr Clarkson today. 

114
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm worried about Mrs Hughes. 

115
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,365
We're all worried,

116
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,805
but I don't think
he should've told you. 

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,485
He said it would help
if we lessened her workload. 

118
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm sure it would but she won't be
pleased he's talked about her

119
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:49,240
before it's been confirmed. 

120
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,765
- So it is cancer?
- Not until it's confirmed. 

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
Don't say anything. She'd hate
to think the doctor told you. 

122
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,160
He didn't tell me, Mrs Patmore,

123
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,520
you told me. 

124
00:08:10,934 --> 00:08:16,174
Lady Edith... Edith tells me you're
very interested in politics. 

125
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,351
Tom is our tame revolutionary. 

126
00:08:18,386 --> 00:08:20,420
Every family should have one. 

127
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:22,419
As long as you are tame. 

128
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,934
Tame enough for a game of billiards. 

129
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,894
What about it?

130
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,734
Can you tell them where we've gone?

131
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:42,534
We're getting used to Tom
and I hope you will, too. 

132
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:47,339
We haven't spoken, really,
since it was all settled. 

133
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:51,214
I want you to know I quite
understand why you were against it. 

134
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,499
Yes. Well... 

135
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,635
I hope you believe I'll do
my best to make her happy.

136
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,793
 I do believe that.

137
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,459
- It was never personal. 
- No, of course not. 

138
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:04,554
No, it's just because of all this
and I'm far too old. 

139
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,614
The thing is done, there's no point
raking it over. 

140
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,459
But are you happy about it?

141
00:09:11,494 --> 00:09:15,734
I'm happy Edith is happy, I'm happy
you mean to keep her happy. 

142
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,414
That's enough happiness
to be going on with. 

143
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:24,161
There's been a last-minute change
of mind about the wedding menus. 

144
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:28,087
- Couldn't Mrs Patmore do it?
- She's given me her new order list. 

145
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,414
She's done her job,
it's time for me to do mine. 

146
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,654
I don't want you to get tired. 

147
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:36,174
Who have you been speaking to?

148
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:39,379
No-one. What do you mean?

149
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:43,534
Nothing. I don't mean a thing. 
Now, let me get on. 

150
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:51,174
This is a simple stitch but strong
and very useful in a drama. 

151
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,179
When do we get summat to eat?

152
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:55,979
As I was saying, you should start it

153
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:59,254
about half an inch away
from the centre line. 

154
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:03,334
Oh, I'm glad you've come back. 

155
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:06,574
I do hope you've come for our help. 

156
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:08,979
You'd be so welcome if you have. 

157
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:12,014
You wouldn't say that
if you knew what I am. 

158
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:14,499
- I'm past help. 
- Nobody's past help. 

159
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:18,299
If you mean you're a prostitute,
you should know

160
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:22,539
it is true of every woman who has
come here to rebuild their lives. 

161
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:26,061
I'm helping them and I hope I can
help you, too. 

162
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:26,613
That's right. 

163
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,801
Why not come in and help us
rebuild our lives? 

164
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:32,774
That's not why I'm here. 

165
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:36,534
That is, I am a... what you said

166
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:41,534
but I don't want help,
not for myself,

167
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:44,219
but... 

168
00:10:44,254 --> 00:10:47,939
When I make up my mind... 
I'm sorry, this has been a mistake. 

169
00:10:47,974 --> 00:10:51,614
Please, please, don't go, not again. 

170
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,414
It's very strange. 

171
00:10:59,054 --> 00:11:01,099
We're leaving. 

172
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,979
I'm sorry, Mr Charkham,
to snatch him away. 

173
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:08,894
That's quite all right, Lady Mary. 
There will be papers to sign. 

174
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,894
Yes, I expect there will. 

175
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:20,054
Papa's asked Anthony
to meet us there

176
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:22,534
so we can all
face the future together. 

177
00:11:22,569 --> 00:11:24,779
He's bringing Isobel and Granny. 

178
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:28,894
- It's hard for your grandmother. 
- It's torture for all of us,

179
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,974
and if I ever look like I'm finding
it easy to lose my home

180
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:35,134
then I am putting on act. 

181
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,814
- Are you sure you can manage this?
- Quite sure. 

182
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:47,579
It's nothing hot. 
It's not a shooting lunch. 

183
00:11:47,614 --> 00:11:51,694
Give them Champagne. That'll allow
you time to set it out properly. 

184
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:54,699
I'll manage. What's this place
we're visiting?

185
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:58,374
One of His Lordship's houses. I
wonder why they're going there today. 

186
00:11:58,409 --> 00:12:01,149
Maybe he likes
to keep a check on things. 

187
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,991
Maybe. 

188
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,254
- See you there. 
- Off you go. 

189
00:12:04,854 --> 00:12:07,734
She was a cousin of Granny's. 

190
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:10,299
- Do you want to come with us?
- Yes. 

191
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:12,579
- Thank you. 
- Might I have a word, My Lady?

192
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:16,654
- Of course. What is it?
- This is a slightly awkward request,

193
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,334
- what with the wedding tomorrow... 
- Tell me. 

194
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:22,939
Mrs Hughes is very tired. 

195
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:27,014
I wonder if it might be possible for you
to divert some of her work my way?

196
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,734
I don't understand. 
What do you mean tired?

197
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,531
Cora... 

198
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:33,259
Carson?

199
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,034
The fact is Mrs Hughes is ill,

200
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,774
My Lady. She may be very ill. 

201
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:42,259
I'm extremely sorry
to trouble you with this

202
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,854
at such a moment, but I don't want
the wedding to sink her. 

203
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:48,571
Of course not,
but how will we manage

204
00:12:48,606 --> 00:12:51,219
without O'Brien
and now Mrs Hughes?

205
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:55,070
- Miss O'Brien?
- She told Molesley...

206
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:56,815
Cora, please. 

207
00:12:56,774 --> 00:12:58,454
I'm coming. 

208
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:29,454
Mrs Bartlett?

209
00:13:30,694 --> 00:13:32,694
I've brought the money. 

210
00:13:41,014 --> 00:13:43,574
It's your loss
cos I've got nothing to say. 

211
00:13:45,454 --> 00:13:47,899
All I want to know is if Vera ever... 

212
00:13:47,934 --> 00:13:51,814
Oh. So you were on Christian name
terms, were you?

213
00:13:52,894 --> 00:13:54,774
You do surprise me. 

214
00:13:55,694 --> 00:14:01,414
If Mrs Bates ever suggested
she was depressed or unhappy... 

215
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:03,419
Of course she was unhappy. 

216
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:07,414
Her husband had left her
and gone off with a trollop. 

217
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:14,694
He'd changed, you know. She was
scared of him by the end. 

218
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,774
And now we know she had good reason. 

219
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,134
When did you last see her?

220
00:14:22,254 --> 00:14:24,254
You'd better come inside. 

221
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,454
Bates. 

222
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:37,694
Watch out. 

223
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:42,814
- What do you mean?
- Search your room, search your bed. 

224
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,894
They've set you up,
your cellmate and his mates. 

225
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:47,814
Stop talking!

226
00:14:49,214 --> 00:14:51,134
Just do it. 

227
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:56,499
Her door was open so I looked in. 

228
00:14:56,534 --> 00:15:00,334
She was cooking,
but she had to post a letter

229
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,339
so we walked me down the street. 

230
00:15:02,374 --> 00:15:06,334
She said Bates was
coming back later for his tea. 

231
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:08,419
She was terrified. 

232
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:11,174
She was in a strange mood,

233
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,371
jumpy, fearful,

234
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,534
but determined. 

235
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:19,454
She'd made pastry,
she scrubbed it out of her nails

236
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,014
like she didn't care
if she took the skin off. 

237
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:26,054
So after she posted the letter
she went home on her own?

238
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,734
She did, poor soul,
and I never saw her after. 

239
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:37,034
I can remember her now
walking away down the street. 

240
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,921
It was raining. No, not raining,
more like drizzle. 

241
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:44,774
The gaslight seemed to catch
a sort of halo around her. 

242
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:47,431
A halo? Really?

243
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:50,019
You can laugh. 

244
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,174
When did you hear she was dead?

245
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:53,894
Next day. 

246
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:56,699
Somehow, I knew it was Bates. 

247
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,814
When I heard the verdict,
I thought he'd swing. 

248
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:04,294
He should've if the country
hadn't gone soft. 

249
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:12,379
- This is very good of you. 
- Nonsense, we were on the way. 

250
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:16,654
- I wish you'd let me sit in the front. 
- I prefer it, I've ridden

251
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:20,259
- in the front seat many times. 
- Aren't you a wild thing!

252
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:23,220
There's never been a safer
method of travel. 

253
00:16:23,478 --> 00:16:25,180
Nor a faster one. 

254
00:16:25,215 --> 00:16:29,019
Edith's the speed fiend, she likes
to go at a terrific lick. 

255
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,332
Do you think you'll be able
to keep up with her? 

256
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll try. 

257
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:36,379
What's this place like?
Do you know it?

258
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:39,899
A little. My late husband
kept the shooting there. 

259
00:16:39,934 --> 00:16:41,566
We'd sometimes have luncheon
in the house. 

260
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:43,008
Is it nice?

261
00:16:43,729 --> 00:16:46,539
Nice enough, as a retreat
from the world. 

262
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:50,014
I wouldn't have thought
it suited to much else. 

263
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,374
Downton Place. 

264
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,974
How lovely. 

265
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,514
Won't it be a bit cramped? 

266
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,735
You do realize that for most 
people it looks like a fairy palace. 

267
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,379
We'll be able to run it
with a much smaller staff. 

268
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:19,854
This is it. We won't need
more than eight servants, tops. 

269
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,454
So it'll be very economical. It... 

270
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:27,819
What about me? Where am I to go?

271
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:32,614
- We still own most of the village. 
- Oh. Perhaps I could open a shop?

272
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:36,019
Good idea, Granny. 
What do you think it needs?

273
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:40,654
If it's like everywhere else, good
manners and decent conversation. 

274
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:43,934
Then you should have
a roaring trade in minutes. 

275
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:47,619
- How's everything going?
- Very well. 

276
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:50,694
It's unfair Mary had
an archbishop to marry her

277
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:53,019
and you've got poor old Mr Travis. 

278
00:17:53,054 --> 00:17:56,419
I don't mind, it's such short
notice, he was booked up. 

279
00:17:56,454 --> 00:18:00,934
I prefer it, really, to have
the man who christened us. 

280
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,814
What did Charkham come for?

281
00:18:04,934 --> 00:18:07,254
He gave me a letter from Swire. 

282
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:11,374
He left one for each of
the three potential heirs

283
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:13,459
when and if they inherited. 

284
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:16,214
Mine is the only one
to have been delivered. 

285
00:18:16,249 --> 00:18:18,099
What did it say?

286
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:20,094
I haven't opened it. 

287
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,259
I can't decide whether I will. 

288
00:18:23,294 --> 00:18:24,650
Why wouldn't you? 

289
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,335
Because I know
it'll be a paean of praise,

290
00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:31,819
how Lavinia could not have
found a better man, etc. 

291
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:35,894
- And you don't want to read that?
- She could not have found a worse one. 

292
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,510
No, I don't. I feel bad enough
and if I read his words

293
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,454
they will stay with me forever. 

294
00:18:53,414 --> 00:18:57,374
- Mrs Crawley?
- We're back from our delicious luncheon

295
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:00,099
and I was on my way home. 

296
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:03,419
You had a maid at Downton,
Ethel Parks. 

297
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:07,154
I was here when she brought her son
into the dining room. 

298
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,854
- Who could forget that?
- Do you have an address for her?

299
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,374
I do, if she's still there. 

300
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:15,214
You see... 

301
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:19,499
You see, I saw her this morning

302
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,054
and I'm afraid she's fallen
into a bad way. 

303
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,014
- A very bad way.
- Oh, dear. 

304
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:27,059
I am sorry to hear that. 

305
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,937
If you'd like to come with me,
I'll fetch it for you. 

306
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,283
Thank you.

307
00:19:57,214 --> 00:20:00,134
Get up, both of you!
Against the wall!

308
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,134
Mr Turner, search the bunk, please. 

309
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:13,134
- Nothing here.
- What?

310
00:20:25,454 --> 00:20:27,454
Clean this mess up!

311
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:37,334
Bastards!

312
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,574
There's a lot of bastards in here. 

313
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,659
I expect you're tired. 

314
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:56,134
It's a long day up to London
and back. 

315
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:58,379
Worth the journey? Not really. 

316
00:20:58,414 --> 00:21:02,654
Miss O'Brien, might I ask what
you've confided in Mr Molesley

317
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:06,811
but have kept from the rest of us?
I don't know what you mean. 

318
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:10,406
Mr Molesley has given Her Ladyship
the impression you're planning

319
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,534
- a change of some sort. 
- What's this?

320
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,774
I'm sorry, I thought
Her Ladyship would know. 

321
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,739
Know what?

322
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,814
That you're leaving. 

323
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,454
I beg your pardon?

324
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,854
How dare you make
such an assumption!

325
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:35,099
Isn't it time for the dressing gong,
Mr Carson?

326
00:21:35,134 --> 00:21:37,541
- It certainly is. 
- But... 

327
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:40,025
Excuse me, Mr Molesley, 
I've got work to do,

328
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,534
even if you haven't. 

329
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,294
I'll deal with you later. 

330
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:50,534
You're in the soup. I wouldn't be
in her bad books for a gold clock. 

331
00:21:55,613 --> 00:21:59,018
You must've said something
Molesley misinterpreted. 

332
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:04,173
I say nothing to him beyond "Pass
the salt" and "Out of the way".

333
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,218
There must have been something. 

334
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:09,698
I do feel let down, and right
on top of the wedding... 

335
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:13,453
- You sent for me, My Lady.
- Yes. 

336
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,373
Thank you, O'Brien. 

337
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:23,813
Mrs Hughes, I understand
that you're not well. 

338
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:30,493
Whom do you understand that from?
Because if the doctor... 

339
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:32,493
It wasn't Doctor Clarkson. 

340
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:36,293
It is not confirmed that I am ill,
Your Ladyship. 

341
00:22:36,973 --> 00:22:40,853
I've had a test and
I'm waiting for the results,

342
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:42,858
but I am perfectly capable... 

343
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:45,618
Mrs Hughes, I only want
to say one thing,

344
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:49,698
that if you are ill you are welcome
here for as long as you want. 

345
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:54,573
- Lady Sybil will help us to find a suitable nurse. 
- I see. 

346
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:58,730
I don't want you to have concerns
about where you'll go

347
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:02,853
or who'll look after you. 
The answer is here and we will. 

348
00:23:05,933 --> 00:23:08,098
I don't know what to say, My Lady. 

349
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:12,973
There's isn't anything more to say
until we know where we stand. 

350
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,653
Thank you. 

351
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:19,898
He thinks I don't know
but, of course, I do. 

352
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:24,413
We'll spend two weeks in Rome,
then Florence, then Venice,

353
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,418
so I couldn't be happier. 

354
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:29,641
What about Loxley? Is there masses
to be done? 

355
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:30,861
It's not too bad. 

356
00:23:30,896 --> 00:23:33,698
It's not too bad downstairs. 
The bedrooms are killers. 

357
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:38,093
Don't do anything too fast, it takes
time to know how a house works. 

358
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:43,373
You really should go to bed. 
No bride wants to look tired. 

359
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:47,373
It either means she's anxious
or been up to no good. 

360
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:50,373
- I won't sleep a wink. 
- Tonight or tomorrow?

361
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:54,373
Sybil, vulgarity
is no substitute for wit. 

362
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,093
You started it. 

363
00:23:58,773 --> 00:24:00,658
Miss O'Brien?

364
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:03,933
Please understand
I didn't mean any harm. 

365
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:06,058
Why make it up in the first place?

366
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:08,618
- I didn't make it up, I was told. 
- Who told you?

367
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:12,653
Mr Barrow mentioned it, but I think
it was an honest mistake. 

368
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:16,578
No, it wasn't honest
and it wasn't a mistake,

369
00:24:16,613 --> 00:24:20,373
but don't worry about it,
I can tell it wasn't your fault,

370
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,413
so we'll forget about it, shall we?

371
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:25,338
And when you see Mr Barrow,

372
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:29,893
you can tell him I may make
some honest mistakes myself. 

373
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,853
- No doubt we'll find out. 
- Probably the hard way. 

374
00:24:43,173 --> 00:24:46,018
- Why not eat with us?
- Oh, I couldn't do that. 

375
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:49,693
Daisy won't sit down,
the invitation is not in your gift. 

376
00:24:49,728 --> 00:24:52,573
She eats with Mrs Patmore
in the kitchen. 

377
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,733
Fancy a game of something later?

378
00:24:55,653 --> 00:24:57,818
Daisy's busy. 

379
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:01,653
- Anna?
- I want to write a letter. Sorry. 

380
00:25:01,688 --> 00:25:04,533
- I'll play.
- Let's see how we feel. 

381
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:09,538
What do you mean you've read it?

382
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:13,613
I didn't think it was right to destroy a man's
last words without reading them. 

383
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:16,653
- It wasn't your decision. 
- I made it my decision. 

384
00:25:16,688 --> 00:25:19,338
- Do you want to hear what he says?
- No. 

385
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:22,498
Lavinia must have written
to him on her last day

386
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:25,973
- hours before she died. 
- Nonsense. No letter was in her room. 

387
00:25:26,008 --> 00:25:31,415
She wrote to him after she tried to persuade you
to call off the wedding and you wouldn't.

388
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,093
This is quite impossible. 

389
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:40,613
"She loved and admired you for
the sacrifice of your happiness. 

390
00:25:40,648 --> 00:25:42,618
She commended you to my care. "

391
00:25:42,653 --> 00:25:45,498
- I can't listen to any more of this. 
- You must. 

392
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:49,613
"I have few intimates so have added
you to my list of heirs. 

393
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:54,226
It's unlikely
I'll outlive the first two

394
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,853
so there's little chance
of you reading this. 

395
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,578
If you do and the money
has come to you,

396
00:25:58,613 --> 00:26:01,618
know it is with my full knowledge
of what transpired. 

397
00:26:01,653 --> 00:26:08,354
Do not allow grief, guilt or regret
to hold you back in its employment. 

398
00:26:08,727 --> 00:26:10,573
God bless you, my boy. Reggie. "

399
00:26:20,572 --> 00:26:24,012
- Are you sure you didn't write it?
- I assume you know his hand.

400
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,013
Not well enough to test a fortune in it.

401
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:33,253
I'm not accusing you of faking it,

402
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,053
but I suspect someone has. 

403
00:26:37,088 --> 00:26:39,013
So it won't change your mind?

404
00:26:39,048 --> 00:26:41,133
Not yet it won't. 

405
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,933
Time you were in bed. 
It's a big day tomorrow. 

406
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:58,218
I'll just finish this. 

407
00:26:58,253 --> 00:27:00,733
Is there something
I can do for you?

408
00:27:01,893 --> 00:27:03,613
No. 

409
00:27:06,173 --> 00:27:10,813
Did you say anything about me
to Her Ladyship?

410
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,013
I don't know what you mean. Why?

411
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,373
Don't worry. 
She was very kind and... 

412
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:19,178
I was touched. 

413
00:27:19,213 --> 00:27:22,253
As you know,
I don't worship them all,

414
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:25,293
- like you do. 
- I wouldn't put it like that. 

415
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:28,693
But this time, I freely admit it

416
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,533
I was quite touched. 

417
00:27:51,573 --> 00:27:57,018
Am I interrupting? No, please, I
just want to ask you all something. 

418
00:27:57,053 --> 00:28:01,253
- I'm sorry I've not been up.
- Don't worry, I'll change after luncheon. 

419
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,910
I had to catch you
when you were all together. 

420
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:06,879
- How can we help, My Lady?
- It's a funny thing. 

421
00:28:06,914 --> 00:28:09,778
Mr Crawley has heard Miss Swire
sent a letter

422
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:13,933
on the day she died. If so, someone
must have posted it for her

423
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:16,373
and we wondered
if it were any of you. 

424
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:25,253
I'm afraid not. Given that the poor
lady passed away that same day,

425
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:29,338
an incident of this sort would have
been reported to me,

426
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:31,724
- or to Mrs Hughes. 
- That's right, milady.

427
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,854
I see. Well, thank you very much. 

428
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:43,133
- What were that about?
- She wanted to know if anyone had posted a letter

429
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:45,856
- for Miss Swire. 
- Oh, I did that. 

430
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,059
Daisy, what did you say? 

431
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:53,494
Post miss Swire's letter. She asked me
to put it in the box in the hall. 

432
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:57,473
- Why?
- What were you doing in her room?

433
00:28:57,508 --> 00:29:01,220
Making up the fire. We started
talking, she'd written a letter. 

434
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:04,898
She was ever so nice. I still get
sad when I think about her. 

435
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:08,413
And it didn't occur to you to tell me?
- Tell you what?

436
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:11,853
Never mind. I am grateful
to you, Daisy. 

437
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,893
You cannot know how much. 

438
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:19,333
- Well, this is the last of them. 
- I'm glad they've hurried it

439
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:21,378
so she can be married from Downton. 

440
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:26,013
Are you? A little sober reflection
would not have gone amiss. 

441
00:29:26,048 --> 00:29:28,413
Mama, let's try to be positive. 

442
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:33,533
Of all of them, Anthony is the
most traditional choice. 

443
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,178
Robert, Edith is beginning her life
as an old man's drudge. 

444
00:29:37,213 --> 00:29:41,618
I shouldn't think a large
drawing room much compensation. 

445
00:29:41,653 --> 00:29:46,213
- Why dwell on that now? 
- To have the pleasure of saying, "Told you so. "

446
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:52,058
Now, the moment you feel tired,
you tell me,

447
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:56,253
- I'll take over whatever it is you're doing.
- Oh, will you now?

448
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:58,650
Are you sure you want
to come to the church?

449
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:01,013
You could stay here
and have a lie down. 

450
00:30:02,013 --> 00:30:05,498
It would be so nice

451
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:10,853
if people would wait to learn if I
really am ill before boxing me up. 

452
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,378
I don't know what you mean?

453
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:16,253
I don't know anything
about any illness. 

454
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:18,493
 Don't you?

455
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,253
I see. 

456
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:26,698
- Who told him?
- I don't know. 

457
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,653
Maybe he just picked it up somehow. 
He's worried about you. 

458
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:33,813
He's a good man. 
He's a hopeless liar. 

459
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:36,653
That's quite nice, really, isn't it?

460
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:42,453
I've had a message from the doctor. 

461
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:44,933
He'll have the results tomorrow. 

462
00:30:45,613 --> 00:30:47,813
I'm to call in the afternoon. 

463
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,098
Try not to worry. 

464
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:53,893
 I'll try,
but I won't succeed. 

465
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:03,133
That's it, I'll put the hat on later. 

466
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,178
Go straight to Lady Edith. 

467
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:07,978
You look marvellous. 
I feel marvellous. 

468
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:12,393
That is, I feel marvellous because
we don't have to leave Downton. 

469
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:16,880
Lavinia did write to her father
and it was posted from this house. 

470
00:31:16,915 --> 00:31:21,333
In other words, every word Mr Swire
wrote in that letter was true. 

471
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:29,493
Daisy posted it. 

472
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:31,613
The kitchen maid. 

473
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:38,293
- I see.
- Do you, my darling?

474
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:42,938
I hope so, because if you try
to find one more excuse

475
00:31:42,973 --> 00:31:47,053
not to accept the money, I'll have
to beat you about the head. 

476
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,253
I see. 

477
00:31:54,373 --> 00:31:56,458
I do have one condition, however. 

478
00:31:56,493 --> 00:32:00,218
- Make it a good one. 
- Let's not steal Edith's thunder. 

479
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:03,422
I'll tell Robert after it's over
and she's left on honeymoon. 

480
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:06,068
Now, that I can live with. 

481
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,819
You look beautiful. 

482
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:25,334
All of us married. All of us happy. 

483
00:32:26,414 --> 00:32:28,414
And the first baby on the way. 

484
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:34,134
Let's get a picture of the three
of us when we get to the church. 

485
00:32:34,169 --> 00:32:38,214
He looks as if he's waiting for
a beating from the headmaster. 

486
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,699
Do you think I should reassure him?

487
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:45,294
How? He's done it before so he must
be in possession of all the facts. 

488
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:49,614
Perhaps the first Lady Strallan
was a difficult act to follow. 

489
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,774
Or a difficult one to repeat. 

490
00:32:57,894 --> 00:33:00,139
Well, fashionably late is one thing. 

491
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:05,054
Are we going in? Edith, I know
we haven't always got along,

492
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,291
and I doubt things'll
change much in the future,

493
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:11,494
but today I wish you
all the luck in the world. 

494
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:14,214
Thank you. 

495
00:33:28,294 --> 00:33:30,254
Oh, look. 

496
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,974
Thank you very much. 

497
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:08,139
Good afternoon. 

498
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:10,174
Good afternoon, my sweet one. 

499
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:26,139
Dearly beloved, we are gathered... 

500
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:28,814
- I can't do this. 
- What?

501
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,814
I can't do it. 

502
00:34:33,814 --> 00:34:37,174
- You know it's wrong, you said so. 
- My dear chap... 

503
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,899
No, I shouldn't have
let it get this far. 

504
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:43,814
I should've stopped it long ago. 
I tried to stop it. 

505
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,659
What are you saying?

506
00:34:45,694 --> 00:34:48,814
I don't understand
what you're saying. 

507
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:50,654
Edith... 

508
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:56,254
Edith, I can't let you throw away
your life like this. 

509
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,414
What do you mean?

510
00:34:59,414 --> 00:35:01,454
We're so happy, aren't we?

511
00:35:01,854 --> 00:35:05,614
We're going to be
so terribly, terribly happy. 

512
00:35:06,894 --> 00:35:09,714
You are going to be happy,
I pray that you are,

513
00:35:09,749 --> 00:35:12,534
but only if you don't
waste yourself on me. 

514
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,771
Anthony, it is too late for this. 

515
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:16,939
Might I suggest we take a step back?

516
00:35:16,974 --> 00:35:20,619
No, let him go. Let him go. 
You know he's right. 

517
00:35:20,654 --> 00:35:24,814
Don't stop him doing the only
sensible thing in months. 

518
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:27,534
- Thank you, Lady Grantham. 
- But Granny!

519
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,734
It's over, dear, don't drag it out. 

520
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,579
Wish him well and let him go. 

521
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:36,294
- I can't. 
- Goodbye, my dearest darling,

522
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:39,334
and may God bless you... 

523
00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:41,054
always. 

524
00:35:41,854 --> 00:35:43,614
But... 

525
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:06,014
Oh, quick. 

526
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:45,579
When everyone gets back,
can you clear all this away?

527
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:49,619
I want it gone before Lady Edith
comes downstairs. Everything. 

528
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:54,534
Ask the outside staff to help put
back the carpet and the furniture. 

529
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:01,242
Is there anything I could say
to make it better? 

530
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:02,666
No. 

531
00:37:06,294 --> 00:37:10,099
Look at them, with their husbands... 

532
00:37:10,134 --> 00:37:13,974
Sybil pregnant,
Mary probably pregnant. 

533
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:15,894
Just go!

534
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:19,494
- I mean it, go!
- Perhaps you should go. 

535
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:26,054
Oh, Mama. 

536
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:30,054
You are being tested,

537
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:35,054
and do you know what they say,
my darling?

538
00:37:36,694 --> 00:37:39,814
Being tested
only makes you stronger. 

539
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:43,374
I don't think it's working with me. 

540
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:34,814
- What shall we do now?
- There's nothing we can do

541
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:37,171
beyond removing all signs
of a wedding

542
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:39,494
and holding her hand
while she recovers. 

543
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,694
She will, of course. 

544
00:38:42,374 --> 00:38:46,434
Meanwhile, it's time to face
the business of leaving Downton. 

545
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:50,481
Without the wedding to hide behind,
there's no reason to delay it

546
00:38:50,516 --> 00:38:54,494
and astonish the world with
the extent of my wretched failure. 

547
00:38:55,014 --> 00:38:57,014
Actually,

548
00:38:57,734 --> 00:39:01,854
Mary and I intended to make
an announcement at dinner. 

549
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:05,974
- What announcement? What about?
- You don't have to leave. 

550
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,334
I'll explain it later, but... 

551
00:39:09,774 --> 00:39:12,614
I'm going to give you
Reggie's money. 

552
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:16,334
I'll accept it. I'll give it to you. 

553
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,694
Don't be silly, you're not
going to give me any money. 

554
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,894
I am. You don't want to leave. 

555
00:39:26,854 --> 00:39:28,774
Nor does Mary. 

556
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:31,094
Nor do any of us for that matter. 

557
00:39:31,129 --> 00:39:33,294
I still won't take your money. 

558
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:43,059
What I will allow is for you
to invest in the place. 

559
00:39:43,094 --> 00:39:47,094
If we stay, you'll share
the ownership, it'll be your house,

560
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:50,379
your estate as much as mine. 
We will be joint masters. 

561
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:54,534
And if you won't agree, I will sell
and it will all be your fault. 

562
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:10,814
I never thought I'd feel sorry
for an earl's daughter. 

563
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,654
All God's creatures
have their troubles. 

564
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,894
- Anna...
- Yes?

565
00:40:18,854 --> 00:40:22,694
Do you think it's right women
should say what they think?

566
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:27,334
Speak out about romance
and everything?

567
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:33,534
Well, things are changing for us
and the vote won't be long now

568
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:36,819
so they must get used to us
speaking our minds. 

569
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:40,734
- But what?
- With most of the men I've ever met,

570
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:42,899
if you started to court them,

571
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:45,374
they'd be so terrified
they'd run a mile. 

572
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:03,014
- Has she had something to eat?
- Anna took up some sandwiches. 

573
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:05,379
She didn't touch a thing. 

574
00:41:05,414 --> 00:41:10,734
That reminds me. Carson, I don't
want Edith to see any wedding food. 

575
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:16,089
Mrs Hughes and Anna are taking what's
left to Mr Travis tomorrow, for the poor. 

576
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:19,414
If the poor don't
want it, bring it over to me. 

577
00:41:21,974 --> 00:41:26,054
- How can we help Edith?
- By finding her something to do. 

578
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:37,014
Is this all we're getting?
The pickety bits?

579
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,779
Hardly. These are canapes, Alfred. 

580
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:43,734
For your first course,
truffle egg on toast, perhaps?

581
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,379
Oysters a la russe. 

582
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:49,094
- Then what?
- There's lobster rissoles in mousseline sauce. 

583
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:53,334
Or calvados-glazed duckling. 
Or maybe a little asparagus salad

584
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:55,739
with Champagne saffron vinaigrette. 

585
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:59,034
When I think how
you've gone to such pains... 

586
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:02,621
What about the pain
of that poor girl upstairs?

587
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:06,174
Jilted at the alter... 
I couldn't stand the shame. 

588
00:42:06,374 --> 00:42:08,899
Then it's lucky
no-one's ever asked you. 

589
00:42:08,934 --> 00:42:13,234
Poor thing. How will she find
the strength to hold up her head?

590
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:17,534
I'd have to run away and hide
in a place where no-one knew me. 

591
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,134
- She's well out of it. 
- How can you say it?

592
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:22,539
She's young, she's not bad looking,

593
00:42:22,574 --> 00:42:26,114
she could do much better
than that broken-down old crock. 

594
00:42:26,149 --> 00:42:29,619
Sir Anthony may have betrayed
a daughter of this house

595
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:34,014
but he doesn't deserve to be
addressed like that by a footman. 

596
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:37,854
Oh, I think he does. 
Every bit of that and worse. 

597
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,539
Well, maybe just this once. 

598
00:42:40,574 --> 00:42:45,174
Right, what's it to be? Lobster,
duck or asparagus?

599
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,094
Is there any cheese?

600
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:07,454
What would you like me to get you?

601
00:43:07,489 --> 00:43:09,454
A different life. 

602
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:15,854
Let me bring you up some breakfast. 

603
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,614
No. 

604
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:22,894
I'm a useless spinster,

605
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:26,694
good at helping out,
that is my role,

606
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:30,054
and spinsters get up for breakfast. 

607
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:46,134
- Going out?
- Just into the village. 

608
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:48,294
I... have to fetch something. 

609
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:50,259
Can I help?

610
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,254
I'm going down later. 

611
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,214
No, thank you. 

612
00:43:54,974 --> 00:43:57,814
This is an errand
I have to do for myself. 

613
00:43:57,849 --> 00:43:59,534
Ready?

614
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:02,374
As ready as I'll ever be. 

615
00:44:32,694 --> 00:44:34,894
You can be sure of one thing. 

616
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:37,094
I won't be cured by standing here. 

617
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:14,014
- Do you want... 
- No. 

618
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:27,494
Everything all right, Miss O'Brien?

619
00:45:31,374 --> 00:45:35,014
Oh, yes, everything's
all right with me,

620
00:45:35,494 --> 00:45:39,534
but it'll be all wrong with you
before too long, mark my words. 

621
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:41,814
Oh? And how is that, Miss O'Brien?

622
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:44,374
I don't know, not yet,

623
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,739
but it will be. 

624
00:45:46,774 --> 00:45:48,774
You can be sure of it. 

625
00:45:57,934 --> 00:45:59,654
Well?

626
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:02,173
Is it or isn't it? 

627
00:46:02,208 --> 00:46:06,563
It's not cancer. It's a benign
something or other. Nothing more. 

628
00:46:09,054 --> 00:46:11,694
Don't mention
that you've said anything. 

629
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:13,734
She doesn't know that I know. 

630
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:15,614
I won't say a word. 

631
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:26,814
Did you tell him? I would prefer
to say I put him out of his misery.

I haven't had a letter
from Mr Bates in weeks. 

637
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:03,443
He wants me to make
a new life without him. 

638
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:08,494
- Am I to answer to you both?
- I have made an investment. That's all. 

639
00:47:08,529 --> 00:47:12,491
You abandon a pregnant woman in a land
that is not her own while you run for it?!

640
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:16,454
- Other men have normal families. 
- No family is ever what it seems. 

641
00:47:16,694 --> 00:47:19,934
- Tell them I'm all right. 
- Sybil? Hello?

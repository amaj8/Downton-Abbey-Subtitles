1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,725
Get that, will you?

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,280
Anna, what have you got for hair
in the evening?

3
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,405
Er, diamond stars and one tiara.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,240
We may not use it,
but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,460
Wrap it all in brown paper so they won't

6
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:37,760
have a basket to worry
about at the other end.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,760
Suitcases are finished.
OK. I'll go up and get them now.

8
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:44,817
It's quite a palaver, isn't it?

9
00:00:44,852 --> 00:00:46,886
Do they go to Duneagle every year?

10
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,920
Not last year,
after Lady Sybil died.

11
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:50,925
And not during the war.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,400
But otherwise, it's the high spot
of His Lordship's calendar.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,980
Come on - quickly, quickly.

14
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,800
Straight on to the wagonette.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,885
Why aren't we taking the guns?

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Because you're going stalking,
Mr Molesley,

17
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:15,237
and stalking
does not involve shotguns.

18
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:17,760
Maybe we should take them,
just to be sure.

19
00:01:17,795 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm already sure.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,320
Yeah.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,240
Why don't I go on my own?

22
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,085
Darling, this isn't 1850.

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,400
No-one expects me to hide indoors
until the baby's born.

24
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:02,480
Well, all right. If you're certain.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,080
If you change your mind at any point
and want to come home, just tell me.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,440
Well, no.
We'd be thrilled to see you.

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,000
It just seems an awfully long way
to come for a walk.

28
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,365
Who was it?

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
My editor, Michael Gregson.

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,480
He's realised he'll be in Scotland
at the same time as us.

31
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:34,600
Don't tell me
he'll be near Duneagle. Apparently.

32
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,360
What a coincidence.

33
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:38,445
Yes, isn't it?

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,285
Ask him over. We want to meet him,
don't we, Robert?

35
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,880
Why are the Flintshires based
in Scotland when the title's Welsh?

36
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:48,440
Shrimpie's grandmother was Countess
of Newtonmoor in her own right.

37
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,285
It's now their courtesy title.

38
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,200
Dare one ask
why he's called Shrimpie?

39
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:54,205
It was a nursery game.

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
Louisa was a lobster, Agatha was
a shark, which is easy to believe,

41
00:02:58,115 --> 00:03:00,120
and I suppose
Shrimpie was a shrimp.

42
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:02,525
Is he very small?

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
No, but he was the youngest.

44
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,605
I'm sorry you won't be with us.

45
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,280
Why should they ask me?
I don't know them at all.

46
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,845
Nor do I, really.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,325
Are you sure you should be going?

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,700
Don't be a spoilsport.
I still have a month.

49
00:03:17,735 --> 00:03:21,005
You don't want me to go, either?

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
I think you should take good care
of yourself, milady. That's all.

51
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:28,165
I agree. Right, let's get started.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,880
I told Mama we'd be on the platform
at quarter to, and we're late.

53
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,565
Feels like a holiday, doesn't it?

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,045
Oh, don't worry. It won't feel
like a holiday once we get there.

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,040
Let me just retrieve the briefcase.
They might need it for the journey.

56
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
I want to check their dining-car
seats for lunch.

57
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,845
Do you like Scotland?

58
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,900
Have you really never been?
They didn't go last year.

59
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,787
And you know I wasn't
a proper lady's maid before that.

60
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,640
No, I meant as a child,
or when you were growing up.

61
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,685
My mother's mother was Scottish.

62
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
She was a Keith -
did I tell you that?

63
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,160
No.

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,520
Now, you won't forget to take her
for some decent walks?

65
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:14,285
She can be lazy.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Don't worry. She'll be fine.

67
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,485
Have you got everything?

68
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,565
Well, if I haven't,
it's too late now.

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,245
Do you think it's wise
to leave him here unsupervised?

70
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,200
What do you mean? Well, I know
he's house-broken, more or less,

71
00:04:32,235 --> 00:04:34,520
but I don't want freedom
to go to his head.

72
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,605
I'll keep an eye on him.

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,965
He can come to dinner tonight.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh.
Well, that's one day taken care of.

75
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:43,560
Only nine to go!

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
So will we have a bit of a break
while they're away, Mr Carson?

77
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:24,280
What?

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,720
He meant can we expect
some time off?

79
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:29,720
For an outing, or something.

80
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:31,165
I don't understand.

81
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,480
Has someone forgotten
to pay your wages?

82
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:35,325
No.

83
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,005
Exactly.

84
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,485
Now, we will start
with the ceremonial wear,

85
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,400
and when that's done, I want all the
silver brought down for cleaning -

86
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:46,645
one room at a time.

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,965
And don't you maids
think you're out of it.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,560
We'll give every room a thorough
cleaning while they're away.

89
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,365
You can let them have
a bit of free time, can't you?

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,160
If they get the extra work done,
then I'll think about it.

91
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,440
Edna?

92
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,240
Why hasn't Mr Branson been asked
to go with the others?

93
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,205
I'm sure I don't know.

94
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,200
I wonder what Lady Flintshire made of her
cousin's daughter eloping with a chauffeur.

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,000
It's not your place to wonder.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,325
What was she like?

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,720
She was a sweet, kind person.

98
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,760
And a real beauty.

99
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,800
Inside and out.

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,280
You'd think
she could have done better.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,680
But SHE didn't think she could do
better, and that's what matters.

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,760
He's nice-looking -
I'll give him that.

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I don't think you're required
to give him anything.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,245
She'll be a long way off.

105
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,420
But not in the middle of nowhere.

106
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,560
There are hospitals in Inverness.

107
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,445
You mean I'm being an old woman.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,120
Well, after Sybil,
who can blame you?

109
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,080
It'll be very quiet for you,
with them all gone.

110
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,045
It will.

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,925
Why not come to supper tomorrow?

112
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,280
I daren't call it dinner, as I
don't know what we can conjure up.

113
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,837
But do come.
I don't want to be a nuisance.

114
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,360
You won't be.
Tom Branson's here this evening,

115
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:40,177
so I shall be back in training.

116
00:07:40,212 --> 00:07:42,960
Thank you. I'd be delighted.

117
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,440
Oh, Mr Carson sent me up to clear.

118
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:53,000
He thought you'd be out of here.

119
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:54,965
I should be.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,720
Seems sad for you to be left behind
all on your own.

121
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,360
I'm used to it.

122
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Yes. Yes, of course. You would be.

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,880
It must be very hard.

124
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,920
Don't worry about me.

125
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,925
Plenty to do.

126
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,720
You're the new maid, aren't you?
What's your name?

127
00:08:15,755 --> 00:08:17,525
Edna.

128
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,320
Edna Braithwaite.

129
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,445
Hello!
Robert, how are you?

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,485
Shrimpie, this is so nice of you.

131
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,720
Nonsense. I can't tell you
how glad we are.

132
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,800
Cora. Edith.

133
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:50,080
Hello!

134
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,720
Daddy, this is Matthew,
defender of the downtrodden -

135
00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,520
including me!
I don't know why I've earned that.

136
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,685
We met at your wedding. Mary.

137
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Aunt Violet, we feel so privileged
to have lured you this far north.

138
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,440
You flatter me,
which is just as it should be.

139
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:09,045
We've got lots planned.

140
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
There's the Ghillies' Ball,
which Mary's always the star of.

141
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:13,685
Rose, don't wear them out.

142
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,965
We remembered how you liked
our mountain loch,

143
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,360
and we've arranged for luncheon
to be taken up there one day.

144
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,360
That was my idea.

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,925
Well, whosever idea it was,
it's a lovely one.

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,440
Tea is in the library
when you're ready to come down.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,325
I'm looking for a Mrs Patmore.

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Why is that, then?
I've got some deliveries for her.

149
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,885
Really? Where from?

150
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,060
You're not very curious,
are you

151
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:11,165
And you're not one of our regulars.

152
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,840
Well, if you must know, I've taken
over from Mr Cox in Thirsk.

153
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,720
Mr Patmore sent an order in to him.
What's this?

154
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:19,845
Do I hear my name taken in vain?

155
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,480
I was just explaining.
You sent an order in to Mr Cox.

156
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:26,057
I've bought the shop
and all the stock,

157
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:28,565
so I took the liberty
of filling it out.

158
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,885
How do you know
she wants to do business with you?

159
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,360
All right, Mr Barrow. I can fight
my own battles, thank you.

160
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:37,360
So where is this order, then?

161
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Bring it to the kitchen.

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,280
And what's your name,
since you know mine?

163
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:48,840
It's Tufton. Joss Tufton.

164
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,885
Hmm.

165
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,965
What's this?

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,720
Some vichyssoise left over
from last night.

167
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Oh, that's heaven!

168
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,960
Any more leftovers going begging?

169
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,000
Have a bit of the tart if you like.

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,040
I don't mind if I do.

171
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,360
I've not had food that good since
the last time I were in London.

172
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,960
I'm not just a pretty face.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,360
This family's fallen on its feet
and no mistake.

174
00:11:25,395 --> 00:11:27,685
I wouldn't mind eating food like
that every day.

175
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,140
Enough of the flannel.
I'll keep the order,

176
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,560
but if there's owt amiss
you'll be hearing from me.

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,560
Let's just hope that there's
something not quite up to scratch.

178
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,165
Why do you say that?

179
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Cos I'd like to hear
from you again, Mrs Patmore.

180
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:44,480
I would.

181
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,400
Be off with you, you cheeky devil!
Go on!

182
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,240
Are you not hungry?

183
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,320
It's a bit early for us. We eat
our dinner after the family's.

184
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,405
Oh, I agree with you, Miss Crawley.

185
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,440
In London we eat last thing,
when all the work is done,

186
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,445
and I prefer it.

187
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
How about you, Miss Grantham?

188
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,285
Me?

189
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,685
Oh, I do what I'm told.

190
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,600
It makes me laugh when I hear Miss O'Brien
and Mr Bates called Mr and Miss Grantham.

191
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,440
Miss Bates and I don't often work
in the same house party.

192
00:12:28,475 --> 00:12:31,045
Of course - you two are married,
Miss Crawley.

193
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,285
How do you manage at home,
being called Bates and Bates?

194
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,040
We're not. They still call me Anna,
like when I was a housemaid.

195
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:42,045
Which isn't right.

196
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,040
I do so hate
to see a lady's maid downgraded.

197
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:47,045
Oh, I so agree, Miss Grantham.

198
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,525
But then, we would think alike,
wouldn't we?

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,720
It's a treat to have a kindred
spirit come to stay. It really is.

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,125
Tell Mrs Crane I've gone up.

201
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,240
I'll announce dinner in 10 minutes.

202
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,685
How marvellous.

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
I should remind you
that he'll be back

204
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,197
to pipe us awake at eight o'clock.

205
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:53,605
And he keeps it up
through breakfast.

206
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,920
So the chances of getting back
to sleep again are nil.

207
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:59,080
All right, Shrimpie,
the point has been made.

208
00:13:59,115 --> 00:14:00,925
You've no need to apologise.

209
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,765
I'm glad to see
the old ways being maintained.

210
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,080
Tomorrow, we'll kit you out
with some rifles for some practice.

211
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:09,085
And what is planned for the women?

212
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,880
Well, there's a picnic by the loch
the day after tomorrow.

213
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:15,120
And the Ghillies' Ball on Friday
is always good fun.

214
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:17,125
As long as it's not too much fun.

215
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,160
As a matter of fact, a friend
of mine is staying quite nearby.

216
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,765
I thought I might telephone him.

217
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,360
But you must ask him here.
She doesn't have to.

218
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,365
Oh, please do.
I'd like to meet him.

219
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
That's settled, then.
Invite him to dinner tomorrow night.

220
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:34,840
Unless, of course, Susan objects.

221
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,880
Why on earth would I object?

222
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,620
I thought it was
too good to be true.

223
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:44,005
He's sent dried ginger
instead of fresh.

224
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,840
It's my fault. I just put 'ginger'
because Mr Cox knew what I liked.

225
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,845
I might go into Thirsk tomorrow.

226
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,005
I can take it back for you
if you want.

227
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,440
Would you? You should go with him,
Alfred. You'd like that shop.

228
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,845
Who's doing what tomorrow?

229
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,720
Mr Barrow's going in to Thirsk.
I said Alfred should go with him.

230
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:05,960
Who says I can spare them?
What about Mr Branson's luncheon?

231
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:08,640
I doubt he needs an under-butler,
Mr Carson.

232
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,645
Or two footmen.

233
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,320
He told me he'd get lunch
at the Grantham Arms.

234
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,325
So can they go?

235
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,000
I suppose so. But there's a lot
to be done, and don't forget it.

236
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,365
I hope you'll come here
whenever you like.

237
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
It must be odd, being alone
in that great house.

238
00:15:26,035 --> 00:15:27,285
Well, I'm not alone.

239
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,325
There's people I know well.

240
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,765
Except they're all downstairs,
and I'm up.

241
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,720
Well, why not take the opportunity
to spend some time with them?

242
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:39,245
I don't think old Lady Grantham
would approve of that.

243
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,440
No, but I doubt she approves of
the working class learning to read.

244
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,645
Tom, can I take this chance to say

245
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,760
you've managed a very delicate
transition superbly?

246
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,760
Thank you.

247
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,160
But don't be too eager to please.

248
00:15:58,195 --> 00:16:00,165
You have a new identity.

249
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,000
And I don't mean because
you're not a chauffeur any more.

250
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:07,085
You are the agent of this estate,

251
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,520
and as the agent,
you have a perfect right

252
00:16:09,555 --> 00:16:11,920
to talk to anyone
who works under you.

253
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Anyone you choose.

254
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
That's quite a speech.
I mean it.

255
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,720
You have a position now,
and you're entitled to use it.

256
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,405
Mr Branson!

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,800
I didn't want to drag one of you
upstairs to open the door.

258
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:38,245
That was kind.

259
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,720
I wondered if you would allow
the maids to clean during the day

260
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,897
while the family's in Scotland?

261
00:16:43,932 --> 00:16:46,040
You don't need my permission.

262
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,085
But I do.

263
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,600
And if you want to use a particular
room, then please let me know

264
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,200
and we'll vacate it at once.

265
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,765
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

266
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,640
Good night.
Good night, Mr Branson.

267
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
I was a bit shaken up on the train.

268
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
Please don't say anything -
I don't want to worry Mr Crawley.

269
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:11,520
You don't want to give him
the satisfaction, you mean.

270
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I can't spoil his last treat
before fatherhood claims him.

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,320
Not that he'll change his ways
much, if he's like most men.

272
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,960
Are they looking after you?

273
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:27,560
Oh, yes.

274
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,840
But I'm a bit nervous
about this Ghillies' Ball.

275
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,840
Why?

276
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,800
I suppose I just feel so...

277
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,845
..English.

278
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I don't want to look a fool.

279
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,720
I love reeling. If I weren't
pregnant, I'd dance until dawn.

280
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
But you ARE pregnant, milady.

281
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
Bloody hell!

282
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Welcome to the Highlands.

283
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,805
Now take your time.

284
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,880
You're not chasing a pheasant.
Be calm and confident.

285
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,365
I thought I was.

286
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,965
These are noble beasts.

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,445
We must take them out
for the good of the herd,

288
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,760
but they've earned our respect
and deserve a clean death.

289
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:43,805
Fine words.

290
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,040
How are you getting on?

291
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:48,205
Not too bad, Your Lordship.

292
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,280
That's high praise from Nield.
He's being kind.

293
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,605
I doubt your father
needs much practice.

294
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,040
His Lordship was born with a rod
in one hand and a gun in the other.

295
00:18:58,075 --> 00:18:59,897
That sounds rather uncomfortable.

296
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,706
I love to hear your ghillie speak.

297
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:03,445
It's like a voice from
a bygone age.

298
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,640
Where's Susan? Aunt Violet
wanted to see the gardens,

299
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:08,640
so I left them to it.

300
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,760
Rose is not anxious
for her mother's company.

301
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:15,937
How's it going with you?

302
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:18,045
I'm in for an adventure.

303
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm to don a ceremonial uniform
and hold mighty sway

304
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,685
on some distant shore.

305
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,480
You won't mind a foreign posting?

306
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,565
Why not?

307
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,120
They say a change of sink
is as good as a rest.

308
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,445
Hello!

309
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,445
You do know where it will be?

310
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,180
No, but it will be filthy and
dirty, and the food will be awful

311
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:42,880
and there will be no-one to talk to
for a hundred square miles.

312
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,720
It sounds like a week
with my mother-in-law.

313
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,740
Will Rose go too?
Why?

314
00:19:49,775 --> 00:19:51,760
What's she been saying?

315
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,800
My dear, no-one can accuse me
of being modern,

316
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:58,840
but even I can see
it's no crime to be young.

317
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,245
I know that, Aunt Violet.

318
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,380
But you don't see
how they gang up on me.

319
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:07,445
Then I shall strive
to keep the peace.

320
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,480
That's all very well,
but you are my mother's sister,

321
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:13,520
and you can jolly well
be on my side.

322
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,725
I'd like to travel more.

323
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,400
We see a bit of London in the
season, otherwise it's Yorkshire.

324
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,965
What about the House of Lords?

325
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,120
When His Lordship goes up,
he just takes Mr Bates with him

326
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,720
and stays in his club,
which is no use to me.

327
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
We're headed
for an outpost of empire.

328
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,200
Her Ladyship's dreading it,
and so am I.

329
00:20:42,235 --> 00:20:44,925
Oh, I don't know.

330
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,200
Something different -
I could quite fancy that.

331
00:20:49,235 --> 00:20:51,205
Well, not me.

332
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,600
All sweat and gyppy tummy? Oh, no.

333
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,960
Did you get him?
I did.

334
00:21:15,995 --> 00:21:17,965
He said he'd love to come.

335
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,445
I'm sure he would.
What do you mean by that?

336
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,120
I can't imagine Mr Gregson finds
himself at Duneagle Castle often.

337
00:21:25,155 --> 00:21:28,200
Or anywhere like it.
Mary, that sounds very snobbish.

338
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:30,085
What's he doing up here?

339
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,840
He's on a sketching holiday.
He's sketching and fishing.

340
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,400
Fishing? Oh, well,
that's something, I suppose.

341
00:21:37,435 --> 00:21:39,365
What do you suppose?

342
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,840
For some reason, Mary's decided
to be nasty about Michael Gregson.

343
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,845
I was questioning his motives
for being in the Highlands.

344
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,840
He's brought his pencils and his
rods. What's wrong with that?

345
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:52,680
Nothing at all, so there.

346
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,445
Afternoon, George.

347
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,560
Can you do me a sandwich, please?

348
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,320
This is very daring -
sitting in a pub on your own.

349
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,800
Want the village
to cut you off dead forever?

350
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,285
I knew you were coming in,

351
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,400
and I don't care
about all that stuff.

352
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,365
Do you have the day off?

353
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,360
I'll fudge it, but no. We've extra
cleaning while the family's away.

354
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,365
Of course, YOUR family.

355
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,920
Well, I am and I'm not,
as I'm sure you know.

356
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,480
Anna said when you first came back
as Lady Sybil's husband,

357
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,920
you refused to dress the part,
but you do now.

358
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,200
I was tired
of talking about my clothes

359
00:22:57,235 --> 00:22:59,440
every time I came downstairs.

360
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
I'm still the same man inside.

361
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Then why not join us for dinner
one night, instead of eating alone?

362
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,885
Well, tell her
I'll not forget again.

363
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,960
By heck, it were worth a visit,
Mr Tufton. What a range!

364
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:21,205
I've never heard
of some of those spices.

365
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,040
I'll tell you what. We've got
a fair starting here on Friday.

366
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:26,680
I run a stall,
and so do some of the suppliers.

367
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:29,285
Why not come?
What sort of fair?

368
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,760
Well, the usual sort of fair.
Food, games, Morris dancers...

369
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,885
Can we get the time off?
I don't see why not. Jimmy?

370
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,240
Well, I might come if there's
a crowd of us, but not otherwise.

371
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,840
Have you got a minute?

372
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,280
I'll just put a note in that bag
for Mrs Patmore.

373
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:46,880
Go on, then.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,840
I can't let them go gallivanting off
to every fair at the drop of a hat.

375
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:55,880
I mean, what are we paying them for?

376
00:23:55,915 --> 00:23:57,525
They've been working very hard.

377
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,440
Don't they deserve a treat?
Excuse me.

378
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,725
On Friday,
can I take the afternoon off?

379
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,920
I'll make the servants' dinner
and Ivy and Daisy can serve it.

380
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:10,840
Mrs Patmore doesn't often
take the time she's allowed.

381
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:14,400
What about Mr Branson?
I'll see to Mr Branson.

382
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,680
Where are you going,
or shouldn't we ask?

383
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:19,205
There's a fair in Thirsk.

384
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,760
A friend of mine has asked me
to meet him there.

385
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,725
I don't believe it.

386
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Must I be undermined at every turn?

387
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,200
Ooh!

388
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,800
What's got into him?

389
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,840
Mr Barrow and the boys
have asked to go to the same fair,

390
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,320
and he was trying to find a way
to say no.

391
00:24:39,355 --> 00:24:41,085
Why don't we all go?

392
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,640
I'll make Mr Branson a tray and
he can keep charge of the house.

393
00:24:44,675 --> 00:24:48,000
He won't mind. Come on.

394
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,920
It'll be fun.

395
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,560
Mr Gregson!

396
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,080
This is very kind of you,
Lady Flintshire. Not a bit.

397
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:01,057
It's a pleasure to welcome a friend
of dear Edith's.

398
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,965
What a disappointment.
He looks perfectly normal.

399
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Since he came with the express
purpose of dining at Duneagle,

400
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:09,040
he obviously bought a set of tails.

401
00:25:09,075 --> 00:25:11,120
Come and meet my parents.

402
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:13,805
Mama, Granny, Papa,

403
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,365
this is Mr Gregson.
Lady Grantham.

404
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,120
You know, I started to read your
magazine because of Edith's column,

405
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:22,645
but now I wouldn't miss it.

406
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,320
It puzzles me why you choose to
employ amateurs like my daughter.

407
00:25:26,355 --> 00:25:30,085
I agree. Well, is the distinction
very meaningful?

408
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,000
Surely the most important thing is
whether she has something to say?

409
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
Come and meet my sister Mary.

410
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,845
Do stand up.
You're slouching like a field hand.

411
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
Might I just have five minutes
without being criticised?

412
00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:49,200
We knew things were awkward
between them.

413
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,140
But now that I'm here, I don't think
Susan handles it very well.

414
00:25:54,175 --> 00:25:58,040
It is so complicated with a young
daughter who's full of new ideas.

415
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:59,925
She thinks you're fighting her,

416
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,400
when all the time,
you're just frightened.

417
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,440
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,740
We all miss her.

419
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:12,000
Every single day.

420
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
We're going in, everyone.

421
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Come in.

422
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,285
Who's that?

423
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Would you like me to take Miss
Sibby up to the nursery? Thank you.

424
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,320
Go with Edna, darling.

425
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,360
Come here.

426
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,740
Can I ask you something?

427
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:45,720
Be my guest. Please.

428
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,760
Are you ashamed of who you are,
or of who you were?

429
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:53,600
Is that why you won't
eat your dinner with us?

430
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,080
No.

431
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,725
It is not.

432
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Well, I'd better be going.

433
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:14,238
It never really gets dark here,
does it?

434
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:16,878
Not like further south, no.

435
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:21,718
Let's take a picnic out tomorrow.
Just the two of us.

436
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:24,518
They'll be gone for the day.
What do you say?

437
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:26,518
I'd love it.

438
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,038
Is everything all right, milady?

439
00:27:38,238 --> 00:27:41,618
It will be, if you don't tell
my mother you saw me smoking.

440
00:27:41,653 --> 00:27:44,998
Don't worry - you're safe with us.
Would you like a peppermint?

441
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:50,518
I better had. Thank you.

442
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:54,323
Oh, sorry.

443
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:58,278
It's just my mother has been
unusually impossible this evening.

444
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:01,518
My whole childhood would seem
impossible to you, milady,

445
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:03,958
but I survived - so will you.

446
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:08,138
Rose, who are you talking to?

447
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:10,843
Shh.
Come inside at once.

448
00:28:10,878 --> 00:28:13,078
Everyone's in the drawing-room.

449
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:16,718
Thanks for the mint.

450
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:21,283
I should be away.

451
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:23,683
Oh, don't go just yet.

452
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:26,158
Heaven knows I've no desire to.

453
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:30,398
It makes a welcome change
from reading a medical journal

454
00:28:30,433 --> 00:28:33,763
and going to bed with,
well, a glass of whisky.

455
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:37,638
Goodness - I wondered what you
were going to say for a moment!

456
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,278
I sometimes forget, when we meet
in the splendour of the abbey,

457
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:44,963
that you were a doctor's wife.

458
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:48,758
That you know what my life consists
of in a way that no-one else does.

459
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:50,718
At any rate, not around here.

460
00:28:50,753 --> 00:28:52,363
I know.

461
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,318
It's a relief to be able to talk without
having to explain oneself, isn't it?

462
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:59,655
A relief, and a privilege.

463
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,958
And I hope we can do it again.

464
00:29:02,993 --> 00:29:04,238
Soon.

465
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,038
Matthew's asked me to go out
stalking with him tomorrow.

466
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:12,043
So I thought I would.

467
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:15,998
Michael, can I ask you
why you're here?

468
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,243
Tell me the truth. Please.

469
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,798
Well, I want to get
to know your family.

470
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:24,838
What do you hope to achieve?

471
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:31,918
I thought if they knew me,
if they came to like me,

472
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:36,438
they might find it easier
to be on my side.

473
00:29:37,758 --> 00:29:40,818
It won't change the basic facts,
though, will it?

474
00:29:40,853 --> 00:29:43,878
Edith, my basic fact is
that I'm in love with you.

475
00:29:46,438 --> 00:29:50,278
You know that already.
Do I?

476
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:52,395
Yes, I suppose I do.

477
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:54,478
I want you in my life.

478
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:57,958
And I want to be in yours.

479
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:01,518
That's all very well, but...

480
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:07,318
..I just can't see a happy ending.

481
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:09,083
Edith, dear.

482
00:30:09,118 --> 00:30:13,078
Stop fascinating that young man and
come and make a four at bridge.

483
00:30:17,798 --> 00:30:19,683
I've asked Gregson to come.

484
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,438
I won't see you all day,
so he'll be company.

485
00:30:22,473 --> 00:30:25,335
He was right to invest
in those tails, wasn't he?

486
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:28,824
You know Susan's invited him
to the Ghillies' Ball?

487
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,278
He probably had reeling classes
before he left London.

488
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:35,118
Don't dislike him
before you know him.

489
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:39,478
That's the hallmark of our parents'
generation, and I forbid it.

490
00:30:42,438 --> 00:30:44,443
Just be as nice as you are.

491
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,678
You think me nice,
but nobody else does.

492
00:30:47,918 --> 00:30:49,923
What makes you so sure I am?

493
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:54,998
Because I've seen you naked,
and held you in my arms.

494
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:57,558
And I know the real you.

495
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:00,558
Goodness, what a testimonial.

496
00:31:06,438 --> 00:31:09,398
Oh, go on. You were young once.

497
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:11,435
I'm young now.

498
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,438
Well, not old.

499
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:16,598
All the more reason to say yes.

500
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,795
Oh, you'll enjoy yourself.

501
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,958
No. I won't be coming.

502
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:27,283
If I came, they wouldn't have fun.

503
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:30,578
They'd spend the day
looking over their shoulder.

504
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:33,565
Well, I'm going,
whether I spoil their fun or not.

505
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,518
That's different.
They respect you, of course,

506
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:38,398
but I am their leader.

507
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,238
Well, that's put me in my place.

508
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:44,755
Don't envy me, Mrs Hughes.

509
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,203
You know what they say.

510
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,038
'Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.'

511
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,798
The wind is north-west
and getting stronger.

512
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,203
We should get started.

513
00:31:57,238 --> 00:31:59,603
Well, good hunting, everyone.

514
00:31:59,638 --> 00:32:02,518
Oh, Shrimpie's not stalking.
He's coming with me.

515
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,678
Mr Crawley? Mr Gregson?

516
00:32:05,918 --> 00:32:08,403
Is your picnic under control?
Of course.

517
00:32:08,438 --> 00:32:11,198
I'm worried about Mary
bumping through the glen.

518
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:13,563
She doesn't have to come.
No, I know.

519
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:17,758
But she will. We'd best get going,
or we're in for some stick.

520
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,558
Walk on.

521
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:42,158
I'm not sure I'm going tomorrow.
It's such a waste of money.

522
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:46,158
Oh, come on. You've enough for
a few rides and a beef sandwich.

523
00:32:46,193 --> 00:32:47,923
I can buy you all a bottle of pop.

524
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,878
What an offer! Let's take him up
on it, before he thinks again.

525
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,158
Thank you, Mr Barrow,
but I can buy my own pop.

526
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:56,238
Don't pretend you've money to burn.

527
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:58,203
I can always get money.

528
00:32:58,238 --> 00:33:01,478
The store cupboard's open
if you need anything.

529
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,678
No, but I do have something
to ask you.

530
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:05,718
Now, where did I put that box?

531
00:33:05,753 --> 00:33:07,638
This one?

532
00:33:12,918 --> 00:33:16,198
Did you see the lid?
Mrs Kearney's dress shop in Ripon.

533
00:33:16,233 --> 00:33:18,963
She's got a fancy man,
I'm telling you.

534
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:22,358
Mrs Patmore?
Why not? She's a woman, isn't she?

535
00:33:22,393 --> 00:33:24,198
Only technically.

536
00:33:29,878 --> 00:33:34,238
Oh. I was looking for Lady Mary
to tell her we're going.

537
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,238
She's already gone down, milady.

538
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:42,038
You were kind to cheer me up,
yesterday.

539
00:33:42,073 --> 00:33:44,358
I did feel terribly blue.

540
00:33:44,393 --> 00:33:45,963
That's all right.

541
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,838
You must let me know
if I can return the favour.

542
00:33:49,878 --> 00:33:51,478
As a matter of fact...

543
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:55,438
..there is something
you could help me with.

544
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:52,318
We can bring it to a better place.

545
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,778
We don't rush things at Duneagle.

546
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:58,198
Well, that's true, God knows!

547
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,443
You don't think it's too girlish?

548
00:35:08,478 --> 00:35:11,558
What's the matter with
being girlish, once in a while?

549
00:35:11,593 --> 00:35:14,563
Heaven knows
we don't have much opportunity.

550
00:35:14,598 --> 00:35:18,518
Well, I'd wear a coat over it,
so it wouldn't jump out at you.

551
00:35:18,553 --> 00:35:20,358
I hope he's worth it.

552
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:23,398
Read that.

553
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:31,118
'I hope you will allow me the honour
of squiring you through the day.'

554
00:35:31,153 --> 00:35:35,358
No man's wanted to 'squire' me
since the Golden Jubilee.

555
00:35:35,393 --> 00:35:39,238
Even then, he expected me
to buy the drinks.

556
00:35:43,278 --> 00:35:45,758
Suppose he wants something more.

557
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,883
I beg your pardon?

558
00:35:47,918 --> 00:35:53,438
There is only one reason a man
his age courts a respectable woman.

559
00:35:55,638 --> 00:35:58,158
He finds himself in need of a wife.

560
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:09,318
Is there anything to drink?

561
00:36:09,353 --> 00:36:11,318
There certainly is.

562
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,478
Beer!

563
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,678
That's very racy of you.

564
00:36:20,713 --> 00:36:22,478
I am racy.

565
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,718
What shall we drink to?

566
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:28,763
The future.

567
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:31,078
And your Scottish blood.

568
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:34,118
What are you up to?

569
00:36:34,153 --> 00:36:35,358
Nothing.

570
00:36:37,198 --> 00:36:38,998
What are you up to?

571
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:40,438
Nothing!

572
00:36:49,678 --> 00:36:51,923
Well, you managed that very well.

573
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:55,998
When the time comes for me to go,
I'll ask them to send for you.

574
00:36:57,038 --> 00:36:59,038
Is everything all right, Shrimpie?

575
00:37:00,238 --> 00:37:02,638
Of course. Impertinent to ask.

576
00:37:04,998 --> 00:37:07,003
No, it's not all right.

577
00:37:07,038 --> 00:37:09,318
But what's the point
in talking about it

578
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:11,323
when there's nothing to be done?

579
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:14,318
I'm not so sure.
The Marlboroughs have got a divorce

580
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:16,483
and you still see them around.

581
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:18,958
But Sunny Marlborough
has no official post.

582
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:21,363
He hasn't been in office
since the war.

583
00:37:21,398 --> 00:37:25,038
While you must have Susan
next to you under the tropical sun.

584
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,678
She'll do it well.

585
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,038
She can teach diplomacy to experts.

586
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:34,038
But?

587
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,838
We don't like each other.

588
00:37:51,158 --> 00:37:53,598
How can I help, Mr Branson?

589
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:59,718
I was thinking...

590
00:38:01,718 --> 00:38:03,438
It's just...

591
00:38:03,473 --> 00:38:05,043
Yes?

592
00:38:05,078 --> 00:38:07,558
I thought I'd come down
for supper tonight.

593
00:38:07,593 --> 00:38:09,883
Catch up with your news.

594
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:12,878
If you would like to, of course
you'd be very welcome.

595
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:15,275
We don't eat late
while the family's away,

596
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,638
so dinner will be
at about eight o'clock.

597
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:21,398
I'll see you then.

598
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:25,918
Fains I tell Mr Carson.

599
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:38,838
How tiny the glens make one feel.

600
00:38:38,873 --> 00:38:41,398
That is the thing about nature.

601
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:42,923
There's so much of it.

602
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:45,878
Must be lovely to be queen
of such a kingdom.

603
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:48,958
You're right.
We're very lucky in this.

604
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,878
Goodness - we weren't expecting
male company for our feasting.

605
00:38:53,913 --> 00:38:55,998
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

606
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:59,323
How did you get on?

607
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:01,963
Very well. Not too long a trail,

608
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:03,998
and death by a single shot
at the end of it.

609
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:07,203
Nield is cock-a-hoop.
Well done, Papa.

610
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:09,998
Your reward will be
to join the ladies' lunch.

611
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:12,203
An added bonus.
I hope it's venison.

612
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:14,283
Quite right.
We ought to eat what we kill.

613
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,838
Stop talking nonsense and tell
McCree to lay two more places.

614
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,698
10 hours crawling through heather

615
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:28,578
and nothing to show for it.

616
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:31,858
Perhaps it's a parable of life.

617
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:35,023
Reminds me of the trenches rather.

618
00:39:35,058 --> 00:39:39,018
Hours of inching through mud
with no discernible purpose.

619
00:39:43,658 --> 00:39:46,018
Why don't you come fly-fishing
tomorrow?

620
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,538
We might see a bit more activity.

621
00:39:49,538 --> 00:39:52,898
You could bring your evening clothes
to change at Duneagle.

622
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,903
That's rather an imposition.

623
00:39:54,938 --> 00:39:57,098
That's what you're here for,
isn't it?

624
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,103
To get to know us all.

625
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:02,858
And you didn't bring your tails all
this way to dine in a country pub.

626
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,103
No.

627
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,178
No, I suppose not.

628
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:21,583
Have you got a minute?

629
00:40:21,618 --> 00:40:24,658
Because, if you haven't,
it's perfectly fine.

630
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:27,423
A minute for what?

631
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,518
Her Ladyship would like a word.

632
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:31,705
What does she want with me?

633
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,823
Well, what do you think?

634
00:40:33,858 --> 00:40:36,498
She wants to make a fuss,
like she always does.

635
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:42,458
This is so kind of you...

636
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:44,463
O'Brien, milady.

637
00:40:44,498 --> 00:40:49,298
..O'Brien. It's just that Wilkins
here isn't quite able to understand

638
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,778
what I'm getting at when I'm
describing Lady Grantham's hair.

639
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:55,738
I understand, milady, it's just -
Could you help her?

640
00:40:55,773 --> 00:40:57,778
You'll know exactly what I mean.

641
00:40:57,813 --> 00:40:59,623
Oh, er...

642
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:02,423
Well, it's a question of body,
milady.

643
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:06,778
You need more volume to begin,
before you sculpt it, so to speak.

644
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,783
I knew you'd have the answer.

645
00:41:08,818 --> 00:41:12,098
If I could...
Oh, please, please, please.

646
00:41:15,578 --> 00:41:18,418
Wilkins, pay close attention
to what she's doing.

647
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:21,098
Yes, Your Ladyship.

648
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:26,863
Bombay? That sounds rather modest
for a marquis.

649
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:30,183
Well, no, not if it's a step
towards the Viceroy's crown.

650
00:41:30,218 --> 00:41:33,978
I don't know about that. All I do
know is it's going to be very hot.

651
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,823
And all the costumes
of imperial rule

652
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:40,698
are always so peculiarly unsuited
to the climate.

653
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,618
Will you take Rose?
I don't think we should,

654
00:41:43,653 --> 00:41:46,623
but Susan won't discuss it.

655
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:50,358
Unless you want her married
to a third-rate colonial official

656
00:41:50,393 --> 00:41:54,023
with no money and bad teeth,
Susan had better think again.

657
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:57,618
Just as he stood, a gust of wind
comes into the corrie from behind us,

658
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:59,823
a hind got our scent,
and they were away.

659
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:04,178
Really, darling. It's boring enough
to hear about when you succeed...

660
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:06,343
What did you think of Michael?

661
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:10,098
He seems like a nice chap.
We're going fishing tomorrow.

662
00:42:10,133 --> 00:42:12,583
He's had such a lot to put up with.

663
00:42:12,618 --> 00:42:16,098
Oh, God. Not one of your
hard-luck cases, is he?

664
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:19,143
Why must you sound so heartless?

665
00:42:19,178 --> 00:42:22,703
Actually, I think India
would be fascinating,

666
00:42:22,738 --> 00:42:26,138
but I know that Mummy and I
would drive each other mad.

667
00:42:26,173 --> 00:42:28,263
You mustn't be too hard
on your mother.

668
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:31,298
You know, it's natural for her
to be concerned.

669
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:33,303
Concerned?

670
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,103
Is that what she is?

671
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:37,978
I'm sure she loves you very much.

672
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,138
What's this?

673
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:44,618
Rose was just saying
how nice your hair looks tonight.

674
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:49,343
He's what?

675
00:42:49,378 --> 00:42:52,018
It's only meant to be friendly.

676
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,943
Good evening, Mr Carson.

677
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:59,538
I don't expect you to approve.

678
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:01,738
Well, now. Come along in.

679
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:10,138
I hope you won't show an example
of rudeness to the younger staff.

680
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:15,743
I was hoping to catch you.

681
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:17,783
What about a glass of something?

682
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:20,578
No, I won't stay,
but I've had an idea.

683
00:43:20,613 --> 00:43:23,303
I saw Mrs Hughes
in the village today,

684
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:27,018
and she told me the servants have
got up a party for the Thirsk fair.

685
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:31,218
And, erm, I was wondering
if you'd like to go.

686
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:35,478
What, with the servants?
No, of course not.

687
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:38,698
But I could drive us over
for an hour or two.

688
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:40,738
I'm told they do it well.

689
00:43:40,773 --> 00:43:42,343
Why not?

690
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:44,223
It might be fun.

691
00:43:44,258 --> 00:43:47,058
Good. I'll come for you at five.

692
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:52,298
Know what you're going to wear?
Nothing good, that's for sure.

693
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:55,278
I'll keep an eye on the place.

694
00:43:55,313 --> 00:43:57,098
Oh, don't say you're not coming.

695
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:02,343
I-I thought you could drive us.

696
00:44:02,378 --> 00:44:05,658
There is no need for impertinence,
Edna, thank you.

697
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,018
You're all right.
I'm happy to drive them.

698
00:44:08,053 --> 00:44:11,378
But who'll stay here?
I will.

699
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:14,858
You don't want to come to the fair?

700
00:44:14,893 --> 00:44:17,178
I would sooner chew broken glass.

701
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:26,343
It was lovely, milady.

702
00:44:26,378 --> 00:44:29,938
But what about you?
Did you enjoy your day?

703
00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:31,943
Oh, I was stupid
to go to the picnic.

704
00:44:31,978 --> 00:44:34,818
We were shaken about in that trap
like dice in a cup.

705
00:44:34,853 --> 00:44:37,435
Stay in bed for the morning.

706
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:40,204
And take it easy at the ball.

707
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:42,903
Are you looking forward to it?

708
00:44:42,938 --> 00:44:47,418
I am rather. I've been planning
a bit of a surprise for Mr Bates.

709
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:49,743
Why? What sort of surprise?

710
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:52,658
No. It's a surprise for you, too.

711
00:44:55,178 --> 00:44:56,898
Don't forget what I said.

712
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:03,983
What was that?

713
00:45:04,018 --> 00:45:07,183
Just that I've promised
to rest tomorrow.

714
00:45:07,218 --> 00:45:10,258
Which is annoying, because
I'd rather come out with you

715
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:11,858
and interrogate Mr Gregson.

716
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:14,503
Is he going to propose?

717
00:45:14,538 --> 00:45:18,298
I think so. But he's quite opaque.

718
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:20,303
A man of mystery.

719
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:23,423
Edith could use some of that.

720
00:45:23,458 --> 00:45:25,918
You are horrid when you want to be.

721
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:28,378
I know, but you love me, don't you?

722
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:30,378
Madly.

723
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,778
And the man on your right.

724
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:44,338
And...

725
00:45:46,418 --> 00:45:48,458
And then round,
in a figure of eight.

726
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:02,138
You take it easy
with Mr Barrow today.

727
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:05,978
I don't mean...crawl all over him,

728
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,055
but don't spoil things.

729
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,063
You're a fine one to talk.

730
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:11,978
Who rang the police
in the first place?

731
00:46:16,178 --> 00:46:18,178
Sod this. I'm bushed.

732
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:26,863
Suppose someone comes in?

733
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:29,258
They'll find a man
sitting in an armchair.

734
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:31,018
They'll survive it.

735
00:46:40,538 --> 00:46:44,138
Funny thing with Mr Barrow is,
he won't hear a bad word about you.

736
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:46,423
Why? What have I done?

737
00:46:46,458 --> 00:46:49,178
I only meant he won't let anyone
speak against you.

738
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:55,263
What on earth is going on in here?

739
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:58,978
We were just - You were just taking
advantage of the cat's absence.

740
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:01,018
We'll see what
Mr Carson has to say.

741
00:47:01,053 --> 00:47:03,115
Mrs Hughes.

742
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,178
Mr Branson.

743
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:12,938
What time are we leaving?
About half past four.

744
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,578
But Mr Stark can easily drive us.

745
00:47:16,618 --> 00:47:18,258
Because I'm so high and mighty?

746
00:47:19,578 --> 00:47:21,898
You're part of the family now.

747
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,218
There's nothing false in that.

748
00:47:24,253 --> 00:47:25,898
I know.

749
00:47:26,898 --> 00:47:28,903
I hope you do.

750
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:33,178
Because if someone is trying
to make you feel awkward,

751
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:35,498
they're in the wrong, not you.

752
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:39,538
I'll be there at half past four.

753
00:47:56,257 --> 00:47:58,662
I said I'd meet him at his stall.

754
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:01,742
What's that?
He asked me to bring sandwiches.

755
00:48:01,777 --> 00:48:05,057
Can I come? I want to find out
where the best food stalls are.

756
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,617
Why don't we all go?
Here's something for us.

757
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:10,617
Alfred? Mr Branson?
Let's give it a go.

758
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:13,217
I don't mind.

759
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:16,377
What about you?

760
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:19,457
Isn't it a bit rough for Mr Barrow?

761
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:21,457
Oh, I think I could manage.

762
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:25,617
I'll come and cheer you on,
if that's all right.

763
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:28,662
Wait till Mrs Hughes sees that!

764
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,342
Come on.
Don't care about any tug-of-war.

765
00:48:31,377 --> 00:48:34,657
Let's go and find some games.
You do know they're all fixed?

766
00:48:34,692 --> 00:48:37,657
I don't think they are.
They must have seen you coming.

767
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:41,457
Come on, ladies -
drink up, drink up.

768
00:48:41,492 --> 00:48:43,537
We can go and join in the fun then.

769
00:48:43,572 --> 00:48:45,262
What about your stall?

770
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,577
Lucy can look after the stall,
can't you, Lucy?

771
00:48:48,777 --> 00:48:50,022
Cheeky!

772
00:48:50,057 --> 00:48:53,462
I hope you don't mind my saying so,
Mrs Patmore,

773
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:57,097
but in that blouse, you look as if
you've just stepped out of Vogue.

774
00:48:58,137 --> 00:48:59,902
I don't mind.

775
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,417
I don't believe you, but I don't
mind you saying it at all.

776
00:49:03,452 --> 00:49:05,782
You're generous with compliments.

777
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,497
I love to be in love, Mrs Hughes,
I'll not deny it.

778
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,857
Any time, any place -
I love to be in love!

779
00:49:11,892 --> 00:49:13,617
Get away, you daft beggar!

780
00:49:14,897 --> 00:49:18,457
I must find Alfred and tell him
where to look for the spice stall.

781
00:49:18,492 --> 00:49:20,834
If you don't mind my leaving you?

782
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:23,177
No, I don't mind that, either.

783
00:49:46,977 --> 00:49:48,777
Oh, yes!

784
00:49:52,137 --> 00:49:53,977
Any side bets before we begin?

785
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:55,862
Who'd bet on them?

786
00:49:55,897 --> 00:49:58,297
What odds would you give us?

787
00:49:58,332 --> 00:50:00,342
10 to one.

788
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:03,457
Right. A quid on the Downton team.

789
00:50:06,897 --> 00:50:10,457
Any more?
That's enough money down the drain.

790
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:11,697
Ready?

791
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,022
One moment.

792
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:18,617
Mr Tufton,
you'll join our team, won't you?

793
00:50:18,652 --> 00:50:20,434
As a Downton supplier?

794
00:50:20,469 --> 00:50:22,217
If you want us, lad, aye.

795
00:50:24,297 --> 00:50:27,137
Had you already seen him?
What do you think?

796
00:50:27,172 --> 00:50:29,137
Will you be so kind?

797
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:33,857
Tufton's at your service.

798
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:36,022
Good afternoon, ladies.

799
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:39,177
They needed a bit of muscle,
so they sent for Tufton. Feel that.

800
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:41,182
Eh?
Very strong.

801
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,182
That's my name - Joss Tufton.

802
00:50:43,217 --> 00:50:45,862
See that stall with the spices on?
That's me.

803
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:48,497
If you want a bit of spice in
your life, send for Tufton.

804
00:50:48,532 --> 00:50:50,417
Take the strain!

805
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:54,297
Pull!

806
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:01,217
Of course it's a lot to ask,
but what else can I do?

807
00:51:02,217 --> 00:51:04,657
I'm prevented
from divorcing a woman who...

808
00:51:05,657 --> 00:51:07,662
..doesn't even know who I am.

809
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:10,657
Does the law expect me
to have no life at all until I die?

810
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,257
Would Lord Grantham?

811
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:15,942
My father-in-law
would be the first to understand

812
00:51:15,977 --> 00:51:19,957
you have to make some sort of
life for yourself beyond the pale.

813
00:51:19,992 --> 00:51:23,937
I do. You can't expect him to want
you to involve his own daughter.

814
00:51:23,972 --> 00:51:27,457
Not when all you have to offer
is a job as your mistress.

815
00:51:27,492 --> 00:51:29,097
No. I love her.

816
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:32,302
I...

817
00:51:32,337 --> 00:51:33,937
I'm offering my love.

818
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:38,057
You've been misled
by our surroundings.

819
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:42,217
We're not in a novel by
Walter Scott.

820
00:51:49,377 --> 00:51:52,577
Come on, lads! Come on, boys!

821
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:59,377
Come on, Mr Branson!

822
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,417
Mr Tufton!

823
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:07,817
Pull it! Pull the rope!

824
00:52:07,852 --> 00:52:09,817
Come on, boys!

825
00:52:16,097 --> 00:52:20,217
I declare the Downton team
the winner!

826
00:52:22,337 --> 00:52:24,857
Thank you very much.

827
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:36,657
Well done, Jimmy.
Thank you, Mr Branson.

828
00:52:38,577 --> 00:52:42,937
So the laws of society should
be preserved, no matter what?

829
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:47,297
Edith gave me the impression
you were a freer soul than that.

830
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,297
I find that hard to believe.

831
00:52:52,177 --> 00:52:56,377
I agree your position is tragic
and I'm very sorry.

832
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:01,817
You can't imagine I would let Edith
slide into a life of scandal

833
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:03,897
without lifting a finger
to stop her?

834
00:53:03,932 --> 00:53:05,902
Will you tell Lord Grantham?

835
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:10,577
I'm not going to tell anyone, but
you must see it's quite hopeless.

836
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:12,617
You're saying I should leave now?

837
00:53:12,652 --> 00:53:15,554
Not stay for the ball?
No.

838
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:18,457
Use it to say a proper goodbye.

839
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:21,217
You owe her that.

840
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:33,577
Oh, don't!

841
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:35,417
Oh! Sorry!

842
00:53:41,937 --> 00:53:43,937
Let's have a drink.

843
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:48,022
One all round, all right?

844
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:50,577
My pleasure, lads, my pleasure.

845
00:53:50,612 --> 00:53:53,097
Hoop yourselves a fortune, ladies.

846
00:53:54,137 --> 00:53:55,582
Thruppence for three.

847
00:53:55,617 --> 00:53:58,097
Thruppence? Never in this world.

848
00:53:58,132 --> 00:53:59,702
Look at the prizes, eh?

849
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,817
Not fairground rubbish here,
you know.

850
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:03,897
When did you last see
a gold sovereign?

851
00:54:03,932 --> 00:54:05,377
When did you last win one?

852
00:54:05,412 --> 00:54:07,022
What's the matter?

853
00:54:07,057 --> 00:54:09,817
I want a go, but Daisy
thinks it's too expensive.

854
00:54:09,852 --> 00:54:11,817
Oh, have it on me.

855
00:54:13,977 --> 00:54:16,697
Here. One go for each of them.
Are you drunk?

856
00:54:16,732 --> 00:54:18,382
'Thank you, Jimmy.
How kind of you.'

857
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:21,897
It is kind. Thanks very much.
Don't flash your money about.

858
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:24,137
It's my money.
I'll do what I want with it.

859
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:28,857
Remember, the ring must go
over the base and lie flat.

860
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:37,577
Ohhh. Now you.

861
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:45,737
I don't believe it!
I've never won nothing before!

862
00:54:47,737 --> 00:54:50,217
Don't let it make a gambler of you.

863
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:52,697
See? I told you they were honest.

864
00:55:00,857 --> 00:55:02,902
Thanks for not telling Mr Carson

865
00:55:02,937 --> 00:55:05,097
about us sitting down
in the drawing-room.

866
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:06,702
We'd not be here now.

867
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:08,737
Well, don't let me catch you again.

868
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:14,337
Oh, there's Mrs Crawley
with Dr Clarkson!

869
00:55:19,257 --> 00:55:22,017
This is where I belong. I know it.

870
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,782
What, at a fairground stall?

871
00:55:23,817 --> 00:55:26,977
No, working with food. Cooking.
Preparing.

872
00:55:28,017 --> 00:55:30,022
Don't sound so tragic.

873
00:55:30,057 --> 00:55:32,702
Your time at Downton
won't be wasted.

874
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:36,377
You know how a great house runs
now. That'll come in handy -

875
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:42,137
What's the matter?
Nothing.

876
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,217
Well, that was great fun!

877
00:55:49,217 --> 00:55:51,257
With the music and everything.

878
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:53,262
I'm glad we came.

879
00:55:53,297 --> 00:55:55,302
I'm very glad you came.

880
00:55:55,337 --> 00:55:57,377
Shall we sit down for a bit?

881
00:55:57,412 --> 00:55:59,382
Let me fetch you a drink.

882
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:01,457
There's something I want to ask you.

883
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:03,457
Punch?
That would be lovely.

884
00:56:07,937 --> 00:56:09,942
You won't miss service?

885
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:13,617
Well, I've not been unhappy,
you know. I can't pretend I have.

886
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:15,582
But taking orders from a husband,

887
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:18,817
it's got to be better than
from some jumped-up lord or lady.

888
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,017
It's still orders, isn't it?

889
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:26,137
Did you make this pate, as well?

890
00:56:26,172 --> 00:56:28,622
All with my own fair hand.

891
00:56:28,657 --> 00:56:32,697
Well, fair hand or red flipper,
you're the cook for me.

892
00:56:42,657 --> 00:56:45,897
Where do you think you're going,
my laddo? Get out of my way.

893
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:53,257
Take him.

894
00:56:57,337 --> 00:56:59,422
Let him go.

895
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:02,257
And who's gonna make me?
I am.

896
00:57:03,297 --> 00:57:04,937
Leave it, Jimmy!

897
00:57:04,972 --> 00:57:06,737
Run! Run!

898
00:57:11,257 --> 00:57:13,657
Go!

899
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:30,902
There.
Thank you.

900
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:33,377
I'm so sorry.
The queue was a mile long.

901
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:36,377
What was it you wanted to ask me?

902
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,382
Ah.

903
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:40,737
Well, I'm not sure I have the right.

904
00:57:41,777 --> 00:57:45,217
If you'd like me
to come back to the hospital, I -

905
00:57:45,252 --> 00:57:47,217
No, it's not the hospital.

906
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:49,977
I'd be interested to know...

907
00:57:51,017 --> 00:57:53,302
..if you've ever thought
of marrying again.

908
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:56,822
Are you thinking of
getting married, Dr Clarkson?

909
00:57:56,857 --> 00:58:01,537
Because if you are, you're a better
man than I am, Gunga Din.

910
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:04,142
Why?

911
00:58:04,177 --> 00:58:09,777
Well, with good friends like you,
I enjoy my life as it is,

912
00:58:09,812 --> 00:58:12,737
and I wouldn't want to risk things
by changing it.

913
00:58:15,377 --> 00:58:17,377
Excuse me!

914
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:21,537
Doctor! Doctor,
you've got to come now!

915
00:58:21,572 --> 00:58:23,377
What is it?
It's Thomas. Please!

916
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:31,957
Rose, you are not wearing
that dress, and that is final.

917
00:58:31,992 --> 00:58:35,484
Oh! Daddy, please stick up for me.
She looks like a slut.

918
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:38,888
Heavens! That's not a word
you often hear among the heather.

919
00:58:38,923 --> 00:58:42,257
But Princess Mary has one
just like it. It's the fashion now.

920
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:45,297
Then it is a mad fashion.
Aunt Violet, tell her.

921
00:58:45,332 --> 00:58:47,222
Oh, my dear, in my time, I wore

922
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:50,417
the crinoline, the bustle
and the leg-o-mutton sleeve.

923
00:58:50,452 --> 00:58:52,742
I'm not in a strong position
to criticise.

924
00:58:52,777 --> 00:58:56,017
Rose, take Aunt Violet
through to the ballroom.

925
00:58:56,052 --> 00:58:57,057
Now.

926
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:07,137
Do you know, Rose dear, the first
Ghillies' ball I ever attended

927
00:59:07,172 --> 00:59:10,302
was at Balmoral in 1860.

928
00:59:10,337 --> 00:59:12,342
Yes, I'd not long been married,

929
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:16,422
and I confess, you know,
I was a little alarmed,

930
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:20,262
because all the men
were as tight as ticks.

931
00:59:20,297 --> 00:59:23,517
Don't blame me
if she is the object of ridicule.

932
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:26,737
I won't, whatever else
I might blame you for.

933
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,222
You are a fool to indulge her.

934
00:59:30,257 --> 00:59:33,257
Have you never stopped to think -
Will you stop?!

935
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:37,097
Stop making everyone so unhappy
all the bloody time!

936
00:59:39,457 --> 00:59:42,577
Forgive me.
I think I know where I'm going.

937
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,577
I'll come with you.

938
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:53,297
Is there any chance of apprehending
these men? Not really.

939
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:56,697
But why did you get into a fight?
It's not like you.

940
00:59:58,737 --> 01:00:03,017
What have they taken? Every penny
I had, but it wasn't much.

941
01:00:03,052 --> 01:00:06,062
Is anything broken?
I don't think so.

942
01:00:06,097 --> 01:00:08,377
He'll be all right?
We ought to get him home.

943
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:10,537
I'll fetch the wagonette.
I'll help him.

944
01:00:12,537 --> 01:00:14,542
Lean on me.

945
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,097
Well done. Up here.

946
01:00:39,657 --> 01:00:43,137
Hello? What's the matter
with you, eh?

947
01:00:44,217 --> 01:00:46,217
Where's your na... Ohhh!

948
01:00:47,217 --> 01:00:50,377
Let's have a little chat about it.

949
01:00:50,412 --> 01:00:52,377
Eh? There.

950
01:01:05,937 --> 01:01:07,902
We must all join in.

951
01:01:07,937 --> 01:01:10,422
Not me, milady,
and I have a cast-iron alibi.

952
01:01:10,457 --> 01:01:14,062
I can do an eightsome and a dashing
white sergeant, but that's it.

953
01:01:14,097 --> 01:01:17,937
I'm very good. Hamilton House is my
favourite, but I know most of them.

954
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:21,017
You won't be doing any tonight.
Spoilsport!

955
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,017
I think Mr Crawley's right, milady.

956
01:01:23,052 --> 01:01:25,097
Will you be staying out of it?

957
01:01:25,132 --> 01:01:27,057
We'll have to see.

958
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:34,102
O'Brien!

959
01:01:34,137 --> 01:01:38,937
Wilkins has been trying her best
to imitate you. What do you think?

960
01:01:38,972 --> 01:01:41,134
It looks very nice, Your Ladyship.

961
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:43,262
Yes, well, it's not right yet,

962
01:01:43,297 --> 01:01:45,937
but we're trying our best,
aren't we, Wilkins?

963
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,622
I might go and find a drink.

964
01:01:48,657 --> 01:01:51,937
I'll fetch you one.
There's no need. I'll go.

965
01:01:51,972 --> 01:01:53,994
No. I insist.

966
01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:56,017
You're the guest.

967
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:19,737
You must be careful.
Matthew says it's rather strong.

968
01:02:19,772 --> 01:02:22,062
I should jolly well hope so.

969
01:02:22,097 --> 01:02:25,057
Rose's evening had a bumpy start.

970
01:02:25,092 --> 01:02:27,974
I'm afraid Susan isn't herself.

971
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:30,857
But she's absolutely herself.

972
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:33,194
That's the problem.

973
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:35,462
Oh, dear, poor souls.

974
01:02:35,497 --> 01:02:39,657
It's bad enough parenting a child
when you like each other.

975
01:02:39,692 --> 01:02:43,457
Can I trouble you for a drop
of whisky, Mr Nield?

976
01:02:43,492 --> 01:02:45,102
Certainly, Miss Wilkins.

977
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:47,937
But I am surprised if it's for you.

978
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,902
Oh, no!

979
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:52,137
For a guest from the south.

980
01:03:04,177 --> 01:03:06,217
Oh, you're back, then?

981
01:03:06,252 --> 01:03:08,217
We are.

982
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:11,702
And we've a few stories to tell.

983
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:15,497
But you've spent your day
more productively, I see.

984
01:03:17,537 --> 01:03:20,017
Where's Nanny?
I'm not sure,

985
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:22,462
but she'll find us in a moment.

986
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:26,137
I was thinking about Lady Sybil
when she was this age.

987
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:29,777
All we can do for her now
is to cherish her bairn.

988
01:03:29,812 --> 01:03:32,914
And it's lovely
to watch you doing just that.

989
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:36,017
There's no need to get sentimental,
Mrs Hughes.

990
01:03:37,737 --> 01:03:40,357
Right. Let's get this one
back to bed.

991
01:03:40,392 --> 01:03:42,977
Come on.
Shall we go and look for Nanny?

992
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:56,982
Where is Shrimpie?

993
01:03:57,017 --> 01:04:00,137
Hiding and licking his wounds.
I'll go in search of him,

994
01:04:00,172 --> 01:04:03,097
poor fellow,
if he hasn't come back.

995
01:04:05,097 --> 01:04:07,097
That's very kind. Thank you.

996
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:18,737
Don't you want it?
No.

997
01:04:19,777 --> 01:04:21,897
I wouldn't drink that
if I were you, Mr -

998
01:04:23,537 --> 01:04:25,977
Oh, that slipped down a treat!

999
01:04:26,012 --> 01:04:28,417
I'll see if I can get another one.

1000
01:04:29,457 --> 01:04:31,177
Each to his own.

1001
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:34,397
Was it always this bad?

1002
01:04:34,432 --> 01:04:36,584
Not at the beginning.

1003
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:38,702
We weren't madly in love,

1004
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:42,817
but there was a job to be done,
and we both believed in it.

1005
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:46,782
Then the children came along,

1006
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:50,657
and for years
we hardly had time to think.

1007
01:04:50,692 --> 01:04:52,342
What went wrong?

1008
01:04:52,377 --> 01:04:56,657
First James left,
then Annabel got married.

1009
01:04:58,217 --> 01:05:02,057
We started to learn
just how little we have in common.

1010
01:05:09,217 --> 01:05:11,217
Why is Susan so hard on Rose?

1011
01:05:11,252 --> 01:05:13,462
Who knows?

1012
01:05:13,497 --> 01:05:17,537
Perhaps Rose reminds her
of me as I used to be.

1013
01:05:18,577 --> 01:05:22,177
Me, when I had
something to live for.

1014
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:25,742
Oh, you have a great deal
to live for.

1015
01:05:25,777 --> 01:05:29,217
Duneagle!
I can't remember being as envious

1016
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:31,694
as I have been these past few days.

1017
01:05:31,729 --> 01:05:34,137
Don't be. It'll all have to go.

1018
01:05:35,137 --> 01:05:37,137
What?

1019
01:05:38,217 --> 01:05:40,222
It's my own fault.

1020
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:43,657
If I'd had any gumption
and modernised, as you did...

1021
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:47,497
But I sat on my hands
as the money drained away.

1022
01:05:48,497 --> 01:05:50,497
Now it's all gone.

1023
01:05:53,457 --> 01:05:55,462
What will you do?

1024
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:57,817
Go to India first, and then London.

1025
01:05:57,852 --> 01:05:59,822
Oh, it'll be all right.

1026
01:05:59,857 --> 01:06:02,142
What with the club and the Lords,

1027
01:06:02,177 --> 01:06:05,737
Susan and I needn't see
too much of each other.

1028
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:11,817
Shrimpie, my dear chap.
I'm so sorry.

1029
01:06:13,617 --> 01:06:16,657
Rose.

1030
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:21,457
What are we going to do about Rose?

1031
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:35,203
Anna! Come on. This is it.

1032
01:06:35,238 --> 01:06:37,358
This is what?
You'll see! Quick! Come on!

1033
01:06:47,478 --> 01:06:50,638
Look at Anna.
She never said she could reel!

1034
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:53,683
Bates, did you know?

1035
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,718
No, milady. I never knew.

1036
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,638
But isn't she marvellous?

1037
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,963
Yes.

1038
01:07:04,998 --> 01:07:06,998
She is marvellous.

1039
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,523
Oh, Mrs Patmore. How kind of you.

1040
01:07:24,558 --> 01:07:28,558
I want a word, so I thought we
could have some tea while I get it.

1041
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:33,123
You were right.

1042
01:07:33,158 --> 01:07:35,798
He says he loves me
and he can't live without me.

1043
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:39,843
Oh, dear.

1044
01:07:39,878 --> 01:07:41,923
What do you mean, 'Oh, dear'?

1045
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:44,278
It's a long time since
anyone wanted to share

1046
01:07:44,279 --> 01:07:46,598
my seat on the bus, never
mind my heart and home.

1047
01:07:47,638 --> 01:07:49,678
I don't know how to say it.

1048
01:07:49,713 --> 01:07:51,678
Well, find a way.

1049
01:07:55,678 --> 01:08:00,958
Well, I first noticed it when
I was standing at the stall.

1050
01:08:02,718 --> 01:08:05,078
He was flirting with
that young assistant

1051
01:08:05,113 --> 01:08:08,038
and stroking her...
well, bottom.

1052
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:10,043
What?
It's true.

1053
01:08:10,078 --> 01:08:12,638
Then I saw him making eyes
at some other women

1054
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:15,243
when he was pulling
in the tug-of-war.

1055
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:18,118
While I was cheering him?
Later, when I was with Alfred,

1056
01:08:18,153 --> 01:08:20,523
I saw Mr Tufton in the crowd,

1057
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:25,558
and he seemed to be chewing
the mouth off some poor woman.

1058
01:08:26,598 --> 01:08:28,638
Where was I all this time?

1059
01:08:28,673 --> 01:08:30,243
I don't know.

1060
01:08:30,278 --> 01:08:32,678
Dreaming of a better life?

1061
01:08:35,118 --> 01:08:37,118
Oh, Mrs Patmore, I am sorry.

1062
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:41,158
I don't know
if he wanted to eat a few dinners

1063
01:08:41,193 --> 01:08:43,163
before he told you the truth,

1064
01:08:43,198 --> 01:08:46,238
or if he planned to marry you
and chain you to the stove.

1065
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:50,958
Either way,
it was the cooking he was after...

1066
01:08:53,438 --> 01:08:55,078
..and not me.

1067
01:08:57,198 --> 01:08:59,203
I feel terrible.

1068
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:02,638
I should have pulled you away
then and there,

1069
01:09:02,673 --> 01:09:05,278
but you were having
such a good time.

1070
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:11,998
Is there anything I can do?

1071
01:09:12,033 --> 01:09:13,318
No.

1072
01:09:14,918 --> 01:09:17,478
God, I've never felt more relieved
in all my life!

1073
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:20,123
What?

1074
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:24,998
The more he said about how he liked
his beef roasted, his eggs fried

1075
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:29,278
and his pancakes flipped, the more
I wondered how to get away.

1076
01:09:31,078 --> 01:09:32,843
And what if he comes back?

1077
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:35,038
He'll get a thick ear,
and no mistake.

1078
01:09:36,598 --> 01:09:39,078
But how could he do such a thing,
Mrs Hughes?

1079
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:41,558
How could he lead a poor woman on
like that?

1080
01:09:43,598 --> 01:09:47,198
You heard him, Mrs Patmore.
Any time, any place -

1081
01:09:47,233 --> 01:09:50,238
he loves to be in love.

1082
01:09:57,478 --> 01:09:59,838
And that was really his reaction?

1083
01:09:59,873 --> 01:10:01,843
How disappointing.

1084
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:04,718
Well, I wasn't going to tell you
till I was leaving.

1085
01:10:04,753 --> 01:10:06,723
Why not?

1086
01:10:06,758 --> 01:10:08,763
Because I... I...

1087
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:12,478
I wanted us to have
a last evening together.

1088
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:16,598
This is not our last evening.

1089
01:10:17,638 --> 01:10:19,883
Isn't it?
It's odd.

1090
01:10:19,918 --> 01:10:23,358
If you'd asked me before tonight,
how I felt about you,

1091
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:26,083
I'm not sure
what I would have answered.

1092
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:31,398
But now I'm absolutely sure,
and this is not our last evening.

1093
01:10:38,598 --> 01:10:40,238
Ha-ha!

1094
01:10:45,278 --> 01:10:47,358
What in God's name...

1095
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:54,638
Are you proud of your handiwork?

1096
01:10:54,673 --> 01:10:56,915
I don't know what you mean.

1097
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:59,123
Never mind, Miss Wilkins.

1098
01:10:59,158 --> 01:11:02,278
It might do him good
to let it all go for once.

1099
01:11:02,313 --> 01:11:04,958
And I'm grateful. I am.

1100
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:06,803
What for?

1101
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:11,118
Because I need never be held back
by any sense of loyalty to you.

1102
01:11:23,758 --> 01:11:27,398
They do say there's a wild man
inside all of us.

1103
01:11:27,433 --> 01:11:30,078
If only he would stay inside.

1104
01:11:41,478 --> 01:11:45,998
I thought you'd like to know
Mr Barrow is feeling much better.

1105
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:49,803
Thank you, but you should go now.

1106
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:54,198
Just wanted to tell you
what a lovely day I've had.

1107
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:56,723
Really lovely.

1108
01:11:56,758 --> 01:12:00,438
Do you want to meet for lunch
tomorrow in the Grantham Arms?

1109
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:50,958
Are you all right?

1110
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:03,578
I don't think I should have done
that, but I couldn't resist.

1111
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:07,205
This is just what I was afraid of.
Calm down. Everything's fine.

1112
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,798
But I wonder, would you mind
terribly if I went home tomorrow?

1113
01:13:10,833 --> 01:13:14,038
Of course not.
I'll tell Shrimpie tonight.

1114
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,043
No, not you. You must stay here.

1115
01:13:16,078 --> 01:13:18,483
What? I don't want to let you
out of my sight.

1116
01:13:18,518 --> 01:13:22,038
If you come, Mama and Papa will
leave, and the party will break up.

1117
01:13:22,073 --> 01:13:24,243
So what? I'm coming with you.

1118
01:13:24,278 --> 01:13:27,318
It's unfair on Susan and Shrimpie.
I'm perfectly all right.

1119
01:13:27,353 --> 01:13:29,923
It's only a couple more days.

1120
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:32,198
Let me go,
and I'll see you when I see you.

1121
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,358
Please.

1122
01:13:35,438 --> 01:13:40,118
Besides, Molesley may need a bit
of time before he's fit to travel.

1123
01:13:45,518 --> 01:13:47,523
That was Mr Bates on the telephone.

1124
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:49,838
Lady Mary and Anna
are coming back today.

1125
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:51,523
They're already on the train.

1126
01:13:51,558 --> 01:13:55,198
Well, we'd better look sharp. Edna,
air the room and make up the bed

1127
01:13:55,233 --> 01:13:57,198
while I go and talk to Mrs Patmore.

1128
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,255
Must I?

1129
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:01,243
Why?

1130
01:14:01,278 --> 01:14:03,358
Do you have other plans, Edna?

1131
01:14:04,438 --> 01:14:08,278
I said I'd meet...Tom Branson
for lunch in the village.

1132
01:14:08,313 --> 01:14:10,315
Did you, indeed?

1133
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,318
'Tom' Branson?

1134
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:20,758
Before you start,
it may not be his fault.

1135
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:23,678
Whether it's his fault or not,
she has to go.

1136
01:14:23,713 --> 01:14:25,283
Oh, yes.

1137
01:14:25,318 --> 01:14:27,958
Of course she has to go.

1138
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:31,003
Will you tell him, or will I?

1139
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:34,638
You'd better do it. I'd only be rude,
which wouldn't help anyone.

1140
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:44,123
You've heard about Mary?

1141
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:46,638
I have. Her maid left a message
with O'Brien.

1142
01:14:46,673 --> 01:14:49,643
I hope you don't think her rude.

1143
01:14:49,678 --> 01:14:52,118
I know you haven't always
approved of Mary.

1144
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:54,123
She's having a baby.

1145
01:14:54,158 --> 01:14:58,278
We all need a little leeway
when it comes to our babies.

1146
01:14:58,313 --> 01:15:02,398
And as for the other business,
I'm not as harsh as I was.

1147
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:07,198
Rose is proving quite an education.

1148
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:09,323
I can imagine.

1149
01:15:09,358 --> 01:15:11,683
I find myself worrying about Rose

1150
01:15:11,718 --> 01:15:14,598
before I even open my eyes
for the morning.

1151
01:15:16,358 --> 01:15:18,443
Do you think I'm being stupid?

1152
01:15:18,478 --> 01:15:21,998
Not at all. I understand better
than anyone else here could.

1153
01:15:23,038 --> 01:15:26,523
Shrimpie wants her to live
at Downton while we're in India.

1154
01:15:26,558 --> 01:15:30,198
I've told Robert I would never
agree to that against your wishes.

1155
01:15:30,233 --> 01:15:32,523
I know. Thank you.

1156
01:15:32,558 --> 01:15:35,558
It's not often that I get support
in this house.

1157
01:15:37,318 --> 01:15:40,163
But I wonder now if he isn't right,

1158
01:15:40,198 --> 01:15:43,643
and that we need a rest
from one another.

1159
01:15:43,678 --> 01:15:47,998
Apart from anything else,
I can't bring her out from Bombay.

1160
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,123
But would you be prepared
for all that?

1161
01:15:51,158 --> 01:15:54,118
If you want me to be,
and only if you want it.

1162
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:57,878
What about you and Shrimpie?

1163
01:15:57,913 --> 01:15:59,883
Oh, we'll soldier on.

1164
01:15:59,918 --> 01:16:01,918
Our sort never accept defeat.

1165
01:16:05,078 --> 01:16:07,158
Even if I wish we could.

1166
01:16:13,438 --> 01:16:16,958
Will you speak well of me to her?

1167
01:16:16,993 --> 01:16:19,735
Not every day, but sometimes?

1168
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:22,478
Course I will. I promise.

1169
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:29,243
So I spoiled things for her.

1170
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:33,238
I'm afraid the work
would no longer satisfy her.

1171
01:16:33,273 --> 01:16:35,243
I've seen it before.

1172
01:16:35,278 --> 01:16:37,518
She'd unsettle the other maids.

1173
01:16:37,553 --> 01:16:39,723
I didn't encourage her, you know.

1174
01:16:39,758 --> 01:16:43,558
Maybe. But if I may say it,
you didn't discourage her, either.

1175
01:16:45,958 --> 01:16:47,958
Can I ask one thing?

1176
01:16:49,478 --> 01:16:52,323
That you give her
a decent reference, please.

1177
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:56,718
I will. Though I don't think
she's cut out to be a housemaid.

1178
01:17:00,558 --> 01:17:04,838
Would you allow me to speak
as I would have in the old days?

1179
01:17:04,873 --> 01:17:06,838
Go on, then.

1180
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:11,918
You let Edna make you ashamed
of your new life.

1181
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:14,958
But you've done well.

1182
01:17:16,038 --> 01:17:18,918
And Lady Sybil would be so proud.

1183
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:29,958
I can't bear to be without her.

1184
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:41,483
You must bear it.

1185
01:17:41,518 --> 01:17:44,338
And one day I hope,
and so would she,

1186
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:47,123
you'll find someone
to bear it with you.

1187
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:52,318
But until then, be your own master
and call your own tune.

1188
01:18:01,178 --> 01:18:03,178
Thank you.

1189
01:18:11,218 --> 01:18:14,343
Milady? Is something the matter?

1190
01:18:14,378 --> 01:18:17,298
I don't want to alarm anyone,
but will you leave the cases

1191
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:19,458
and take me
straight to the hospital?

1192
01:18:19,493 --> 01:18:21,023
Milady.
What?

1193
01:18:21,058 --> 01:18:24,778
Let Mrs Crawley know, and get a
message to Mr Crawley straight away.

1194
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:37,578
Mr Crawley?

1195
01:18:38,578 --> 01:18:40,583
Mr Crawley!

1196
01:18:40,618 --> 01:18:42,538
What in God's name...?

1197
01:18:52,658 --> 01:18:56,978
Right. All change. The whole family
is coming back tomorrow

1198
01:18:57,013 --> 01:18:58,663
and we must be ready to receive them.

1199
01:18:58,698 --> 01:19:01,903
Is it because Lady Mary's
in the hospital? It is.

1200
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:06,138
Does that mean she's in danger?
No. It doesn't mean any such thing.

1201
01:19:06,173 --> 01:19:10,338
Lady Mary will be perfectly fine,
but we have to make allowances.

1202
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:18,218
Now, do you have everything?

1203
01:19:21,258 --> 01:19:23,058
What have I done wrong?

1204
01:19:24,098 --> 01:19:26,103
I'm as good as Mr Branson.

1205
01:19:26,138 --> 01:19:30,338
And there was nothing improper.
Nothing at all.

1206
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:32,338
I'm sure.

1207
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:36,158
But there are rules
to this way of life, Edna.

1208
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:38,578
And if you're not prepared
to live by them,

1209
01:19:38,613 --> 01:19:41,378
then it's not the right life
for you.

1210
01:19:52,898 --> 01:19:56,778
It's organised. We've got tickets
for the first train in the morning.

1211
01:19:56,813 --> 01:20:00,338
There isn't one before then.
I just wish I was there with her.

1212
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:06,098
I can't wait to get home.

1213
01:20:07,378 --> 01:20:09,978
Aren't you enjoying your Victorian
idyll any longer?

1214
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:11,863
I'm glad I was jealous of Shrimpie.

1215
01:20:11,898 --> 01:20:13,983
It's made me realise
what a fool I've been.

1216
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:16,538
Downton will survive
because of Matthew's vision.

1217
01:20:16,573 --> 01:20:18,543
I'm so pleased to hear you say it.

1218
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:21,018
You always knew
how lucky we are in Matthew,

1219
01:20:21,053 --> 01:20:22,903
and now I give thanks for him

1220
01:20:22,938 --> 01:20:25,618
as I give thanks
for my home and my family.

1221
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:28,298
And most of all,
I give thanks for my wife.

1222
01:20:33,738 --> 01:20:35,818
Send us the news
as soon as you know it.

1223
01:20:35,853 --> 01:20:38,783
And thank you for taking in Rose.

1224
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:41,958
We'll make firm plans
when we know when we're leaving.

1225
01:20:41,993 --> 01:20:45,098
I'm glad to have her,
now I know it's what you both want.

1226
01:20:46,218 --> 01:20:50,858
What I want is for her to know that
family can be a loving thing.

1227
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,863
We'll do our best.

1228
01:20:52,898 --> 01:20:55,458
Love is like riding,
or speaking French.

1229
01:20:56,938 --> 01:20:59,383
If you don't learn it young,

1230
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:01,498
it's hard to get
the trick of it later.

1231
01:21:01,533 --> 01:21:04,178
Well said, Shrimpie. And good luck.

1232
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,458
What did you tell Mary
about Michael Gregson?

1233
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:13,743
Nothing.

1234
01:21:13,778 --> 01:21:16,338
I hope you made it clear
what has to happen.

1235
01:21:16,373 --> 01:21:18,898
Oh, yes. We both know
what happens next.

1236
01:21:20,058 --> 01:21:23,658
I'll see you at Downton very soon
and thank you both so much.

1237
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:25,663
We look forward to it.

1238
01:21:25,698 --> 01:21:29,178
Are we all ready, Bates?
We are, my lord.

1239
01:21:54,298 --> 01:21:56,658
Mr Carson? I'm going down
to the hospital,

1240
01:21:56,693 --> 01:21:58,663
and I think I have what she needs.

1241
01:21:58,698 --> 01:22:01,423
If there's anything else at all,
just telephone.

1242
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:05,198
According to the doctor,
there's nothing to worry about.

1243
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:08,938
Of course I worry. After Lady Sybil,
how could I not worry?

1244
01:22:08,973 --> 01:22:11,635
Now, should I meet the others
off the train?

1245
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:14,298
Get Mr Matthew's car
taken to the station,

1246
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,303
and have the others brought here.

1247
01:22:16,338 --> 01:22:18,458
Mr Matthew can drive himself
to the hospital

1248
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:20,578
and come back with the news
when he's ready.

1249
01:22:20,613 --> 01:22:22,975
Yes, good. Very good.

1250
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:25,338
And, Anna, thank you.

1251
01:22:32,538 --> 01:22:36,498
Would you help to prepare her while
I make sure everything's ready?

1252
01:22:36,533 --> 01:22:41,418
Erm, you saved me from making
a fool of myself at the fair.

1253
01:22:41,453 --> 01:22:43,738
I'm afraid I'd too much to drink.

1254
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:45,338
I don't know what you mean.

1255
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,418
Well, I think you do.

1256
01:22:48,453 --> 01:22:50,578
And thank you.

1257
01:22:58,138 --> 01:22:59,743
I wish Matthew were here.

1258
01:22:59,778 --> 01:23:03,818
It's funny. I feel as if
I'm only half myself without him.

1259
01:23:03,853 --> 01:23:05,503
He'll be on the train by now,

1260
01:23:05,538 --> 01:23:09,298
and you won't want him in the room
till it's all over, trust me!

1261
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,303
Oh!

1262
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:13,338
It won't be long now.

1263
01:23:14,898 --> 01:23:18,698
We must ring Carson.
He'll be in such a state. I will.

1264
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:22,498
I shouldn't have gone up north.
How could I be so stupid?

1265
01:23:22,533 --> 01:23:24,898
My dear,
the baby will be perfectly well.

1266
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,703
Slightly early, but not very.

1267
01:23:26,738 --> 01:23:29,418
We'll just have to take
a little extra care, that's all.

1268
01:23:59,978 --> 01:24:01,698
What are you doing up here?

1269
01:24:05,058 --> 01:24:07,938
I just wanted to make sure there
wasn't too much harm done.

1270
01:24:07,973 --> 01:24:11,058
Well, there was enough harm done.

1271
01:24:13,098 --> 01:24:15,178
You were brave, Mr Barrow.

1272
01:24:17,578 --> 01:24:19,178
Very brave.

1273
01:24:21,258 --> 01:24:23,263
I feel badly.

1274
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:25,138
I shouldn't have run off.

1275
01:24:25,173 --> 01:24:27,143
Oh, you should have.

1276
01:24:27,178 --> 01:24:29,498
Otherwise, what was I
bloody doing it for?

1277
01:24:35,098 --> 01:24:37,178
Were you following me?

1278
01:24:40,538 --> 01:24:42,538
I had to keep an eye out.

1279
01:24:44,298 --> 01:24:46,338
I could see
you'd had a bit to drink.

1280
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:48,338
So...

1281
01:24:51,338 --> 01:24:53,343
..yes.

1282
01:24:53,378 --> 01:24:55,538
Yes, I did follow you.

1283
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:57,423
Why?

1284
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,378
You know why.

1285
01:25:17,378 --> 01:25:19,538
I can never give you what you want.

1286
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:22,095
I understand that. I do.

1287
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,618
And I don't ask for it.

1288
01:25:26,258 --> 01:25:29,058
But I'd like it
if we could be friends.

1289
01:25:32,978 --> 01:25:35,103
Right you are, Mr Barrow.

1290
01:25:35,138 --> 01:25:38,978
If that's all,
I think I could manage that.

1291
01:25:40,018 --> 01:25:41,738
Thank you, Jimmy.

1292
01:25:41,773 --> 01:25:43,743
Thank you.

1293
01:25:43,778 --> 01:25:46,698
Make yourself useful for
something, read the paper.

1294
01:25:47,858 --> 01:25:50,658
4:20 at York looks all right
for a flutter.

1295
01:25:53,298 --> 01:25:55,103
Thank you.

1296
01:25:55,138 --> 01:25:57,378
Thank you very much.
We'll keep you posted.

1297
01:25:57,413 --> 01:25:59,378
Thank you very much indeed.

1298
01:26:06,378 --> 01:26:08,823
What about jelly?
That was Mrs Crawley.

1299
01:26:08,858 --> 01:26:12,298
It's over. Lady Mary's very tired,
but she's come through it.

1300
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:15,618
They both have.
Thank the Lord!

1301
01:26:15,653 --> 01:26:17,463
What about the baby?

1302
01:26:17,498 --> 01:26:19,938
What about it?
What sex is it?

1303
01:26:19,973 --> 01:26:22,378
Oh! I never thought to ask.

1304
01:26:22,413 --> 01:26:24,378
Oh, God. Men!

1305
01:26:31,578 --> 01:26:34,458
Can this hot and dusty traveller
come in?

1306
01:26:41,458 --> 01:26:43,458
Say hello to your son and heir.

1307
01:26:57,498 --> 01:27:00,218
Hello, my dearest little chap.

1308
01:27:05,618 --> 01:27:09,418
I wonder if he has any idea
how much joy he brings with him.

1309
01:27:14,778 --> 01:27:16,818
Oh, my darling. How are you?

1310
01:27:16,853 --> 01:27:18,263
Really?

1311
01:27:18,298 --> 01:27:21,978
Tired, and pretty relieved.

1312
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:26,618
But just think,
we've done our duty.

1313
01:27:26,653 --> 01:27:28,623
Downton is safe.

1314
01:27:28,658 --> 01:27:31,618
Papa must be dancing a jig.

1315
01:27:31,653 --> 01:27:33,623
I'm dancing a jig!

1316
01:27:33,658 --> 01:27:36,378
I feel like I swallowed
a box of fireworks.

1317
01:27:51,138 --> 01:27:53,578
You are going to be
such a wonderful mother.

1318
01:27:53,613 --> 01:27:55,578
How do you know?

1319
01:27:56,778 --> 01:27:58,778
Because...

1320
01:28:00,898 --> 01:28:03,098
Because you're such
a wonderful woman.

1321
01:28:06,978 --> 01:28:11,058
I hope I'm allowed to be
your Mary Crawley for all eternity

1322
01:28:11,093 --> 01:28:15,138
and not Edith's version,
or anyone else's for that matter.

1323
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:18,138
You'll be my Mary always.

1324
01:28:19,178 --> 01:28:21,178
Cos mine is the true Mary.

1325
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:26,058
Do you ever wonder
how happy you've made me?

1326
01:28:27,778 --> 01:28:29,783
You sound rather foreign.

1327
01:28:29,818 --> 01:28:34,338
Shouldn't you be saying, 'You'll be
up and about in no time'?

1328
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:37,418
I'll do all that tomorrow.

1329
01:28:38,538 --> 01:28:41,063
But, right now, I want to tell you

1330
01:28:41,098 --> 01:28:44,098
that I fall more in love with you
every day that passes.

1331
01:28:46,018 --> 01:28:48,818
I'll remind you of that
next time I scratch the car.

1332
01:28:48,853 --> 01:28:50,863
Do.

1333
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:52,898
I give you full permission.

1334
01:28:55,818 --> 01:28:57,863
Where are the others?

1335
01:28:57,898 --> 01:29:01,938
Back at the house,
panting to see you.

1336
01:29:01,973 --> 01:29:03,943
To see you both.

1337
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:06,818
But I've sent Mother
to keep them at bay.

1338
01:29:08,578 --> 01:29:10,578
I wanted the chance to be alone...

1339
01:29:11,818 --> 01:29:13,858
..with my family.

1340
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:17,818
You'd better go and tell them.

1341
01:29:18,898 --> 01:29:22,338
But first, I think I've earned
a decent kiss.

1342
01:29:23,378 --> 01:29:25,978
You certainly, certainly have.

1343
01:29:39,258 --> 01:29:42,223
First Sibby, now her little cousin.

1344
01:29:42,258 --> 01:29:45,658
It's rather wonderful, the way
families just keep on rolling.

1345
01:29:45,693 --> 01:29:47,738
Did you have a good time?
I did.

1346
01:29:47,773 --> 01:29:49,738
Very good, in a way.

1347
01:29:49,773 --> 01:29:51,783
How about you?

1348
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:53,898
I've been on
a bit of a learning curve.

1349
01:29:53,933 --> 01:29:56,703
Me too, and it isn't over yet.

1350
01:29:56,738 --> 01:29:59,063
These things
are always nerve-wracking.

1351
01:29:59,098 --> 01:30:01,423
All's well that ends well,
and it won't be long

1352
01:30:01,458 --> 01:30:06,458
before you'll be able to say
hello to your very own grandson.

1353
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:08,503
My grandson!

1354
01:30:08,538 --> 01:30:12,098
Oh, my dear! How sweet
and miraculous that sounds!

1355
01:30:25,098 --> 01:30:27,498
Life is strange, isn't it?

1356
01:30:27,533 --> 01:30:29,898
In so many different ways.

1357
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:31,903
No, I mean,

1358
01:30:31,938 --> 01:30:35,958
I think of all the uncertainty
between Matthew and Mary,

1359
01:30:35,993 --> 01:30:39,978
or when the money was lost,
and everything was so dark.

1360
01:30:40,013 --> 01:30:42,978
Yet now here we are
with two healthy heirs,

1361
01:30:43,013 --> 01:30:44,983
an estate in good order,

1362
01:30:45,018 --> 01:30:48,298
and I wonder what I've done
to deserve it?

1363
01:30:51,458 --> 01:30:53,263
I agree.

1364
01:30:53,298 --> 01:30:57,618
But then, we don't always
get our just desserts.

1365
01:31:12,818 --> 01:31:15,538
You'd better go down.
They'll be here in a minute.

1366
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:20,298
And tell Mr Matthew
he must wait his turn.

1367
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:24,418
He's seen the baby,
and they haven't.

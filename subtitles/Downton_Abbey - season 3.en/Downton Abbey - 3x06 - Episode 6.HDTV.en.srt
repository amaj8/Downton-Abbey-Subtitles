2
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:38,722
Thank you.

3
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:57,923
I know we sound like parrots, Tom,
but I would like to help, if I can.

4
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,004
So would Mary.

5
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,284
My wife is dead.

6
00:01:04,444 --> 00:01:06,763
I'm past help.

7
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:08,804
But thank you.

8
00:01:13,284 --> 00:01:16,683
The guests looked for you
to say goodbye.

9
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:18,684
I was here.

10
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,803
I hope you'll let me know
if there's... anything I can do.

11
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:29,804
Anything at all.

12
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,043
Thank you.

13
00:01:33,044 --> 00:01:37,763
I'll come with you.
Save him getting the car out twice.

14
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,043
You're both very welcome to stay
for some dinner. I don't think so.

15
00:01:42,044 --> 00:01:44,884
Grief makes one so terribly tired.

16
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:48,404
Goodbye, my dear.

17
00:01:50,084 --> 00:01:53,484
Now that it's over,
try to get some rest.

18
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:11,563
Is it over?

19
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,044
When one loses a child,
is it ever really over?

20
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:23,763
Cheer up, Mr Barrow.
A long face won't solve anything.

21
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:29,523
Leave him alone. He knew Lady Sybil
better than any of us. Except you.

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,403
We were the two who really knew her.

23
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:35,763
I must say,
your grief speaks well for her.

24
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:39,604
Thank you for that.
Thank you for saying that.

25
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:45,083
Are you sure you wouldn't like this
in the dining room, ma'am?

26
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:49,804
No, thank you. I'd like to eat
quickly and have an early night.

27
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,363
How was the service?

28
00:02:55,364 --> 00:02:57,524
Oh, quite nicely done.

29
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:02,403
But you know how it is
when you bury someone young.

30
00:03:02,404 --> 00:03:04,404
When you lose your child...

31
00:03:05,844 --> 00:03:08,964
there's nothing worse
under the sun.

32
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,123
I was wondering if I... might try
to take her out of herself.

33
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:17,883
Perhaps give a little lunch party,
nothing formal.

34
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:20,964
Just Lady Grantham and the girls.

35
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,204
And I could cook something special.

36
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:32,003
Well,
we don't have to decide that now.

37
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,683
But I don't understand
why they haven't let him out.

38
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,923
Mr Murray hasn't been to see
Mrs Bartlett yet.

39
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:43,003
And when he does, she may not want
to repeat the things she said to me.

40
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,283
She must be made to repeat them.

41
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:49,323
Even then, would we have enough
to overturn the verdict?

42
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:53,403
How can we prove she was cooking
that pie, not something else?

43
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:56,684
Because something else
would have been found.

44
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:03,604
Look, I'm not saying
it'll all be done by Tuesday.

45
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:07,804
But this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

46
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,804
What's the matter?

47
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:19,004
It's so nice of you to say "we".

48
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:21,883
I mean it.

49
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:24,804
We need some good news
in this house, Anna.

50
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:28,564
And this is it. This must be it.

51
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:39,883
I thought I might move back in here
tonight, if you'll have me.

52
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:45,244
Not yet. I think I'd rather sleep
alone for a while yet.

53
00:04:47,004 --> 00:04:50,604
Well, if you're sure.
I'm sure.

54
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:56,843
Cora... Let's not go through it
all again. I'm not arguing.

55
00:04:56,844 --> 00:05:02,283
You listened to Clarkson and
so should I have done, but Tapsell
has a reputation as an expert.

56
00:05:02,284 --> 00:05:07,004
And you believed him. Dr Clarkson
knew Sybil's history and he did not.

57
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:13,163
You believed Tapsell because
he's knighted and fashionable.

58
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,843
And has a practice in Harley Street.

59
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:21,643
You let
all that nonsense weigh against
saving our daughter's life!

60
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:25,124
Which is what I find
so very hard to forgive.

61
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:29,523
Do you think I miss her
any less than you?

62
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:31,924
I should think you miss her more.

63
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:37,204
Since you blocked the last chance
we had to prevent her death.

64
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,443
I'll say good night, then.

65
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,764
Good night.

66
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:12,603
How's the baby doing?

67
00:06:12,604 --> 00:06:16,084
I envy her.
She doesn't know a thing about it.

68
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:22,684
You ought to think
about getting a nurse.

69
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,723
Mrs Rose will leave,
once the baby's weaned.

70
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:31,523
Perhaps a local girl.
But I'm not staying.

71
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,124
Or at least just until I find a job.

72
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,644
Well, there's no rush.
God, no!

73
00:06:39,764 --> 00:06:44,163
Tom's right. He has to start to make
a life for himself some time.

74
00:06:44,164 --> 00:06:46,644
Some time, yes. Not right away.

75
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,843
And anyway,
now that the funeral's over,

76
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,684
we ought to think about
the christening.

77
00:06:55,484 --> 00:07:00,044
Do you know
what you'd like her to be called?
I'd like to call her Sybil.

78
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:03,764
Of course.

79
00:07:06,324 --> 00:07:10,004
You don't think it might be
a little painful?

80
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:14,804
Very painful, at first,
but I think it's right.

81
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:21,363
I want to remember her mother
whenever I look at her.
Of course you do.

82
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:24,004
And she would want to be remembered.

83
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:28,323
I'll go and see Mr Travis
this afternoon.

84
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:30,244
Why Mr Travis?

85
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:33,043
To... fix the date.

86
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:35,643
But Sybil will be Catholic.

87
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:36,884
What?

88
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:42,204
My daughter is Irish and
she'll be Catholic, like her father.

89
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:53,364
It's time I started my morning.

90
00:08:03,844 --> 00:08:05,644
Mrs Patmore!

91
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,323
Oh, Ethel.

92
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:12,163
Mrs Patmore, I wonder if I could
ask for your advice. Well, I...

93
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:16,243
I suppose you know
I'm working for Mrs Crawley now.
I had heard.

94
00:08:16,244 --> 00:08:20,003
She's been ever so kind to me
and I'd hate her to suffer for it.

95
00:08:20,004 --> 00:08:25,083
She's hired me as cook/housekeeper
but, to be honest,
my cooking's a little rusty.

96
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:26,603
Oh, yes?

97
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:30,443
She's giving a lunch party
to help her Ladyship in her sorrow.

98
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:34,323
She'll tell me to keep it simple,
but I'd like to surprise her.

99
00:08:34,324 --> 00:08:37,443
OUR Ladyship?
Mrs Crawley wants to show sympathy.

100
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:40,643
I know you don't want to stop her.
Of course not.

101
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:45,283
Might you help me
prepare a few dishes? Tell me how
to make them. I'll do the work.

102
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:49,363
Please? Look, I don't mean to be
rude or personal, Ethel.

103
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:55,563
But Mr Carson's made it very
clear... That no-one from the house
is to have dealings with me.

104
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:59,843
You're not afraid I'll corrupt YOU,
are you? I am NOT!

105
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:04,324
Then why should Mrs Crawley
be punished for showing me kindness?

106
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:18,483
You don't look as optimistic
as you did, Bates. Something wrong?

107
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:21,403
Not that I'm aware of, Mr Durrant.
Really?

108
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:23,443
You seem downcast.

109
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:27,564
I wondered if some scheme
to improve your lot had gone awry.

110
00:09:29,764 --> 00:09:34,043
If you know
something to suggest my fortunes
have taken a turn for the worse,

111
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:36,763
perhaps you'd be kind enough
to share it with me.

112
00:09:36,764 --> 00:09:39,483
Am I kind enough to share it
with him, Craig?

113
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:40,643
No.

114
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,644
I don't think I am.

115
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:51,443
Did you hear about
Tom's announcement at breakfast?

116
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,084
He wants the child
to be a left-footer.

117
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:59,843
Papa, I know it's hard...
There hasn't been a Catholic Crawley
since the Reformation.

118
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,083
She isn't a Crawley.
She's a Branson.

119
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:06,803
The only chance that child
will have of achieving anything is
because of the blood of her mother.

120
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:08,843
Well, I don't agree.

121
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:11,363
And besides, Sybil...
That's another thing.

122
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:15,484
I think it's ghoulish to call her
after Sybil. Well, I don't.

123
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,843
No, there's no need to cook.

124
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:26,763
Just fetch some ham from Mr Bakewell
and make a light salad.

125
00:10:26,764 --> 00:10:29,083
You can't go wrong with that.

126
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,643
And Lady Grantham won't want more.

127
00:10:31,644 --> 00:10:35,083
I'd like to make a bit of an effort,
to show our sympathies.

128
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,803
It's a nice idea, Ethel,
but I'd like to keep it safe.

129
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,004
I'll walk up to the house later.

130
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:47,203
What is your plan for the child?
What do you mean?

131
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:49,443
Well, if Branson takes her away

132
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:54,043
to live with him in Liverpool
or wherever he comes to rest.

133
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:58,923
Presumably, it will be his influence
that governs her upbringing.

134
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,763
I hadn't thought about that.
Then, I suggest you do.

135
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:04,284
And soon.

136
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:07,924
What does Cora say?

137
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:12,644
Not much. Not much to ME, anyway.

138
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:16,363
She still holds you responsible?

139
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:20,044
She's wretchedly unhappy,
if that's what you mean.

140
00:11:22,204 --> 00:11:26,003
I will not criticise a mother
who grieves for her daughter.

141
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:30,443
I think she's grieving for
her marriage, as well as for Sybil.

142
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:35,604
Robert, people like us are NEVER
unhappily married.

143
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:39,923
What do we do if we are?

144
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,083
Well, in those moments,

145
00:11:42,084 --> 00:11:46,644
a couple is unable to see as much
of each other as they'd like.

146
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:50,643
You think I should go away?

147
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:54,563
Or Cora could go to New York
to see that woman.

148
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,683
It can help
to gain a little distance.

149
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:01,923
I... I can't seem to think straight
about any of it.

150
00:12:01,924 --> 00:12:03,924
My dearest boy.

151
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:10,283
There is no test on Earth greater
than the one you've been put to.

152
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:14,163
I do not speak much of the heart,

153
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:16,804
since it's seldom helpful to do so.

154
00:12:17,924 --> 00:12:23,404
But I know well enough
the pain when it is broken.

155
00:12:25,964 --> 00:12:27,644
Thank you, Mama.

156
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:32,873
Don't you have any work to do?
I'll clean the silver later.

157
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:37,781
Mr Carson told us to wait for him.
I wouldn't mind YOUR hours!

158
00:12:37,782 --> 00:12:40,141
What's the matter?

159
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:44,181
You look very...
Very what?

160
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,781
I don't know exactly.
Stop gabbing, Ivy.

161
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:50,621
Remember,
you've my work to do tomorrow.
You off to see the rich farmer?

162
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:54,661
Whatever he makes, he earns it.
It'd be nice to be your own boss.

163
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:59,861
No farmer's his own boss.
He takes his orders from the sun and
the snow and the wind and the rain.

164
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,661
Oh, I see!
Is this the new servants' hall?

165
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,942
What have they done
with the old one, I wonder!

166
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:13,901
What are you staring at?
A cat can look at a king.

167
00:13:13,902 --> 00:13:20,422
Well, not at a cook!
Get on with whatever you're doing.
I'll be back before the gong.

168
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,501
I don't know what I'm doing here.

169
00:13:26,502 --> 00:13:29,062
You're here because you're kind.
Am I?

170
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:32,861
This is a list of what you'll need.

171
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:36,301
I'll come in on Thursday
and see how you're getting on.

172
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,501
Can I really do it? Salmon mousse?

173
00:13:38,502 --> 00:13:42,861
Anyone who has use of their limbs
can make a salmon mousse.

174
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:46,981
Lamb chops portmanteau...
I don't know.

175
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:50,741
Surely you can cut up a bit
of chicken liver and some parsley.

176
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:56,662
Why not serve bread and cheese
and have done with it?
You're right. I'll give it a go.

177
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:08,261
Forgive me for barging in,
but I have a little plan.

178
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:12,301
Oh, goodness. You've changed.
It's much later than I realised.

179
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:14,581
We're rather prompt.

180
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:18,021
Robert's invited Mr Travis
to dine with us.

181
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:23,981
What was your plan? I was wondering
if you and the girls might
come to me for luncheon on Thursday.

182
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:26,421
Do I count as one of the girls?

183
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:28,301
Of course!

184
00:14:28,302 --> 00:14:32,061
You're very kind, but I'm not really
going out at the moment.

185
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,061
There'll be no-one else there.
Only me.

186
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:38,661
And a walk to the village
might blow some cobwebs away.

187
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:42,142
I'm afraid I would only bring
my troubles with me.

188
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,621
Hello, Mother. What brings you here?

189
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:51,581
She's just invited Cora and Edith
and Mary to luncheon on Thursday.

190
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,702
Oh, how kind. Thank you.

191
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:58,221
Isobel. Have you come for dinner?

192
00:14:58,222 --> 00:15:01,541
No. I'm dressed quite wrongly,
and you have a guest.

193
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:04,821
I doubt Mr Travis has much of an eye
for fashion.

194
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:07,542
Oh, do stay. We need cheering up.

195
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:14,621
Can you manage?
Course I can.

196
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,381
Sorry. Didn't mean to insult
your manhood.

197
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:21,182
She didn't mean that, either.
Get on!

198
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:26,301
Are you looking forward
to your outing with Mr Mason?
I am. It's a lovely place.

199
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:29,581
You should go with her.
Or I could come out with you.

200
00:15:29,582 --> 00:15:35,422
The trouble with you lot, you're
all in love with the wrong people!
Take those upstairs!

201
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:40,901
Isn't there something or other
un-English about the Roman Church?

202
00:15:40,902 --> 00:15:44,381
Since I am an Irishman,
that's not likely to bother me.

203
00:15:44,382 --> 00:15:50,941
I cannot feel bells and incense
and all the rest of that
pagan fodder is pleasing to God.

204
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:56,101
I see. So is he not pleased by
the population of France or Italy?

205
00:15:56,102 --> 00:16:00,661
Not as pleased as he is
by the worship of the Anglicans. No.

206
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:05,141
South America, Portugal -
have they missed the mark, too?

207
00:16:05,142 --> 00:16:07,621
I do not mean to sound harsh.

208
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:11,501
I'm sure there are many individuals
from those lands who please him.

209
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,821
And the Russians? And the Spanish?

210
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:16,141
There must be many good Spaniards.

211
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:20,261
We haven't started on
the non-Christians,
the whole Indian subcontinent.

212
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,821
The British Empire,
does he approve of that?

213
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:28,901
If you mean, does he approve of the
expansion of the Christian message?
Yes, I think he does.

214
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:33,301
And so do I. Poor Mr Travis,
you're all ganging up on him.

215
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:36,741
You and Granny are ganging up
against Tom. Not me!

216
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:40,741
The Dowager Duchess of Norfolk
is a dear friend.

217
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:43,261
And she's more Catholic
than the Pope!

218
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:49,661
I simply do not think that it would
help the baby to be baptised into
a different tribe from this one.

219
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:51,781
She will be baptised into my tribe.

220
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:55,141
Am I the only one to stand up
for Sybil? What about her wishes?

221
00:16:55,142 --> 00:17:01,941
Sybil would be happy for the child
to be a Catholic. How do you make
that out? Because she said so to me.

222
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,942
On the day she died.

223
00:17:04,782 --> 00:17:08,022
Did she? Oh, God! Did she really?

224
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:14,261
I'm flabbergasted. You're always
flabbergasted by the unconventional.

225
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:20,302
But in a family like this one!
Not everyone chooses their religion
to satisfy Debrett's.

226
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:26,941
I've no wish to persecute Catholics,
but I find it hard to believe
they're loyal to the crown.

227
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:30,901
It'll be a relief for them
that you no longer want them
burned at the stake.

228
00:17:30,902 --> 00:17:33,981
I don't believe in orthodoxy.
That's a long word.

229
00:17:33,982 --> 00:17:38,541
A man can choose to be different
without it making him a traitor.
I agree.

230
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:41,781
I don't like discussing religion.
We'll only fall out.

231
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,781
It's our private business.
Amen.

232
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:48,981
It's funny, though, all that Latin
and smoke and men in black dresses.

233
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:51,061
I'm glad I'm Church of England, me.

234
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:54,821
Really? What do you feel about
transubstantiation? You what?

235
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:58,421
Never mind, Alfred.
Your heart's in the right place.

236
00:17:58,422 --> 00:18:01,502
I can't say that for everyone
under this roof.

237
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:09,621
When Sybil was talking
about the baby being a Catholic,

238
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,062
did you get the sense that she knew?

239
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,021
I'm not sure.

240
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:17,341
Not at the time.

241
00:18:17,342 --> 00:18:19,902
Of course, I've asked myself since.

242
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:24,701
You'd think we'd be used
to young death,

243
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:27,461
after four years of war.

244
00:18:27,462 --> 00:18:31,142
That's why we must never
take anything for granted.

245
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:35,981
Which is what I'm trying
to get Robert to see.

246
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,942
He wasn't given Downton
by God's degree.

247
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:42,502
We have to work
if we want to keep it.

248
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,181
But not only Downton.

249
00:18:46,182 --> 00:18:47,981
Us.

250
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:50,661
We must never take "us" for granted.

251
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,862
Who knows what's coming?

252
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:57,382
Well, I have to take one thing
for granted.

253
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:03,942
That I will love you until
the last breath leaves my body.

254
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:07,182
Oh, my darling! Me too.

255
00:19:08,462 --> 00:19:10,062
Me too.

256
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:15,781
- Maggie!
- What?

257
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:18,502
Meet us down the pub later!

258
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:27,861
But this is quite different
from the story told before.

259
00:19:27,862 --> 00:19:30,742
I don't think it is.
I'm afraid so.

260
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:36,621
You said you went
to Mrs Bates's house
AFTER you'd eaten your evening meal

261
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:39,501
and she was in the process
of cooking hers.

262
00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:43,021
I had just eaten when I saw her,
that's true.

263
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:45,022
But it was dinner at midday.

264
00:19:45,822 --> 00:19:49,422
Mr Bates was going to call on her
that afternoon.

265
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,421
But, er...

266
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:56,741
you described how the light
from the gas lamps

267
00:19:56,742 --> 00:20:00,902
caught the rain
and made a kind of... halo round her.

268
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:06,781
That sounds rather fanciful for me.
So, you do not remember saying it?

269
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:09,982
I don't remember
because I never said it.

270
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,502
I see.

271
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:19,941
As a matter of interest,
why did you let me come today

272
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:23,302
if nothing you could say
would alter the verdict?

273
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:28,262
I thought it was time
you saw how real people live.

274
00:20:42,902 --> 00:20:46,621
Where's Daisy?
Gone off to play the milkmaid.

275
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:50,421
Do you like dancing?
Everyone likes dancing.

276
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:53,261
I love the foxtrot, don't you?
It's all right.

277
00:20:53,262 --> 00:20:57,661
What about you, Alfred?
Alfred wouldn't do the foxtrot,
would you, Alfred?

278
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,981
He takes himself too seriously
for that. Well, I love it.

279
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,782
I think it makes you glad
to be young.

280
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:31,461
Me? Run this farm? Are you serious?

281
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:34,621
Not right away. But eventually.

282
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:40,821
But I'm a cook! You think
there's no cooking on a farm?
You could do a cracking trade.

283
00:21:40,822 --> 00:21:45,021
With jams and jellies
and cake and all sorts.

284
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:47,501
You could sell 'em at the fairs.

285
00:21:47,502 --> 00:21:50,301
But I'm a woman.
Are you?

286
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:52,222
Well, I never knew that!

287
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:57,221
There are widows
who take on a tenancy.

288
00:21:57,222 --> 00:22:01,381
You're liked in the big house.
They'll not refuse you.

289
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:04,182
I own the equipment, all the stock.

290
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:08,501
And I've quite a bit put by.

291
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:11,741
It's hard work,
but you're used to that.

292
00:22:11,742 --> 00:22:14,301
I can't answer now.
No, of course not.

293
00:22:14,302 --> 00:22:16,302
But think on it.

294
00:22:20,582 --> 00:22:22,861
And think on this and all.

295
00:22:22,862 --> 00:22:26,501
My dream would be
if you were to come here

296
00:22:26,502 --> 00:22:29,181
and live with me
so I could teach you.

297
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:32,182
But I always thought
I'd spend my life in service.

298
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:36,261
You have 40 years of work
ahead of you.

299
00:22:36,262 --> 00:22:42,501
Do you think these great houses
like Downton Abbey are going to
go on just as they are for 40 years?

300
00:22:42,502 --> 00:22:44,622
Because I don't.

301
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:49,741
You wanted to speak to me,
Lady Grantham. Yes.

302
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:52,581
On a melancholy matter I'm afraid.
Please.

303
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:58,022
I want to talk a little more about
the death of my granddaughter.

304
00:22:59,062 --> 00:23:01,661
A terrible, terrible tragedy.

305
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:04,541
But now I am concerned beyond that.

306
00:23:04,542 --> 00:23:09,421
Oh? Are you worried for the child?
No, not especially.

307
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,981
She seems quite a tough
little thing.

308
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:17,861
Dr Clarkson, my daughter-in-law
is quite convinced

309
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:22,421
you could have saved Sybil,
had you been allowed to.

310
00:23:22,422 --> 00:23:26,661
One can never speak of these things
with any certainty.

311
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:32,341
Well, this is the point. What was
the likelihood of Sybil's survival?

312
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:36,021
Had we operated?
She might have lived.

313
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:41,981
There are cases where an early
Caesarian saved the mother
after pre-eclampsia. How many cases?

314
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:45,861
Not many, I admit.
I'd need to do some research.

315
00:23:45,862 --> 00:23:51,461
I want you
to tell Lord and Lady Grantham
what you have almost admitted to me.

316
00:23:51,462 --> 00:23:55,221
But... But there WAS a chance.

317
00:23:55,222 --> 00:23:57,541
Dr Clarkson,

318
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:02,301
you have created a division
between my son and his wife,

319
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:07,021
when the only way they can
conceivably bear their grief

320
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:09,461
is if they face it together.

321
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:13,701
So you want me to lie to them,
say there was no chance at all?

322
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,741
"Lie"...

323
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:18,302
is so unmusical a word.

324
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:23,061
I want you to review the evidence

325
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,901
honestly and without bias.

326
00:24:25,902 --> 00:24:30,742
Even to ease suffering,
I could never justify telling
an outright lie.

327
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:35,022
Have we NOTHING in common?

328
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:40,496
It's badly run. It makes no sense
to manage it separately.

329
00:24:40,497 --> 00:24:43,216
What about the tenant?
We'd look after him.

330
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:45,256
He's growing barley and wheat.

331
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:48,656
He'd do better with sheep.
Exactly. We'd merge the grazing.

332
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:53,536
How do you know that?
How do YOU, after spending
your growing years in Manchester!

333
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:57,736
I've been on a steep learning curve
since arriving at Downton.

334
00:24:57,737 --> 00:25:01,577
My grandfather was a tenant farmer
in Galway, black-faced sheep.

335
00:25:02,457 --> 00:25:05,636
So there's a country boy
inside the revolutionary?

336
00:25:05,727 --> 00:25:07,687
Not much of one.

337
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,767
You must hate it here.

338
00:25:11,847 --> 00:25:14,007
No. I don't hate it.

339
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,286
But I don't belong here, either.

340
00:25:17,287 --> 00:25:20,206
What will you do?
I thought of Liverpool.

341
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:22,806
There might be something
for me there.

342
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:25,086
And the baby?

343
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:29,486
I'll hire a woman or get a cousin
over to take care of her.

344
00:25:29,487 --> 00:25:31,646
I don't know.

345
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,767
What else can I do?

346
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:37,407
You could leave her here.

347
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:41,567
No. I'll not be separated from her.

348
00:25:43,807 --> 00:25:46,447
She's all I have left of her mother.

349
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:54,926
Right, you know what you're doing?

350
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:56,966
I think so. Yes.

351
00:25:56,967 --> 00:26:03,326
Use an alarm clock to remind you
when to put things in the oven
and when to take them out. I will.

352
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:05,247
You've done well, Ethel.

353
00:26:06,327 --> 00:26:09,486
Maybe you've also done yourself
a favour.

354
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,647
I'm very grateful.

355
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:37,006
I expected her to deny everything

356
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:40,566
the moment she realised
her testimony would release me.

357
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:44,126
You know she did say
every word of it. Of course.

358
00:26:44,127 --> 00:26:48,846
But I'm afraid someone tipped
her off before I went to see her.

359
00:26:48,847 --> 00:26:50,847
I think I know who.

360
00:26:52,607 --> 00:26:55,486
The question remains
as to what we do next.

361
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:59,326
I wonder what Mrs Bartlett
is thinking at this moment.

362
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:03,966
That she's glad Mr Bates
is still in prison. I'm not sure.

363
00:27:03,967 --> 00:27:08,246
It's a big thing for a woman
like that to lie to a lawyer,

364
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:10,486
to flout the law.

365
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:14,287
They would have bribed her to do it,
or frightened her.

366
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:18,807
Well, we cannot offer a bribe.

367
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:23,646
But perhaps we can try
to... persuade her

368
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:26,246
into returning to the path of truth.

369
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:30,246
Let me see what I can do.
Nothing foolish.

370
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:33,367
You mustn't do anything stupid.
Promise me.

371
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,927
Leave it with me, Mr Murray.

372
00:27:41,607 --> 00:27:44,566
I don't understand.
I can smell cooking.

373
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:49,006
It's quite simple, ma'am. You'll be
pleased, I promise. I've had help.

374
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,927
And I suppose there's no ham
and no salad?

375
00:27:53,727 --> 00:27:58,167
If this luncheon is a failure,
Ethel, I shall hold you responsible.

376
00:28:00,407 --> 00:28:03,846
I'm sorry if I've kept you waiting.

377
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:09,086
It's good of you to spare the time.
I've only the men to cook for today
and they're easy.

378
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,326
What were you doing
at Crawley House?

379
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:16,166
Who says I was at Crawley House?
I saw you coming out. Oh. I see.

380
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:19,686
Well, Mrs Crawley was giving
a luncheon party and I...

381
00:28:19,687 --> 00:28:22,686
And you were helping Ethel.
I suppose I was.

382
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,726
Against my strict instructions
to give the place a wide berth.

383
00:28:26,727 --> 00:28:31,486
Now, Mr Carson, no-one disputes your
position as head of this household,

384
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:36,246
but I'm not sure you're entitled to
dress down Mrs Patmore in this way.

385
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:40,886
If Mrs Patmore wants to spend her
time frolicking with prostitutes...

386
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:46,246
Do I look like a frolicker?
May I ask who's expected
at this precious luncheon?

387
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:49,687
Her Ladyship, the young Ladies
and the Dowager.

388
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,886
You have allowed
a woman of the street

389
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:57,447
to wait at table
on members of our family?

390
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,087
I am speechless!

391
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:07,086
I would guess he won't stay
speechless for long.

392
00:29:07,087 --> 00:29:10,726
I need to spend a day
with the agents to talk it through.

393
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,526
Jarvis has a lot on his plate.
Yes, of course, but...

394
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:17,046
Must we discuss this now?
It's very boring for Tom. I don't...

395
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:21,246
Tom is your son-in-law and his
daughter is your only grandchild.

396
00:29:21,247 --> 00:29:26,286
None of which gives him a word
in running this place, or would
you involve Carson or the maids...?

397
00:29:26,287 --> 00:29:30,206
I really... We have to act
if we are to avoid another crisis.

398
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:34,006
Capital is leaking into the cracks
caused by bad management.

399
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:36,007
Bad management?

400
00:29:37,207 --> 00:29:39,367
We'll discuss it later.

401
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:45,806
My Lord, I wonder if
I could have a word? Can't it wait?

402
00:29:45,807 --> 00:29:48,247
No, my Lord. It can't.

403
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:58,526
Mr Carson's got a bee in his bonnet.
What's that about? Never you mind.

404
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:00,726
Ivy, have you been running?

405
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:05,246
No. Why? Your colour's up.
Hope you're not coming down
with something.

406
00:30:05,247 --> 00:30:08,606
How was your day off, Daisy?
Lovely, thank you.

407
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:12,366
What are you doing...
with your day off?

408
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:15,727
What I usually do.
Go somewhere on my own.

409
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:19,886
You never give up, do you?
He's not interested.

410
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:23,686
He must be interested in someone.
He's young, isn't he?

411
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,847
But that someone is not you.

412
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:33,487
How was Mr Mason?
Very well. As nice as usual.

413
00:30:34,687 --> 00:30:36,647
What is it?

414
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:39,486
He wants me to live at the farm.

415
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:46,046
Because he wants to leave me the
tenancy and all his stock and tools
and all his money and everything.

416
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:48,846
My lord! You're a proper heiress.

417
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,126
I haven't said yes, yet.
He's made the offer.

418
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:56,326
A very generous one it is, too.
He's ever so generous.

419
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:58,367
And so kind.

420
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,206
This was very good.

421
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:08,766
It was. It really was.

422
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,966
Don't sound so surprised.
I am surprised.

423
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:15,887
I owe Ethel an apology.
I've underestimated her.

424
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:20,046
I sometimes wonder
if I should learn to cook. Why?

425
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:24,806
It might come in handy one day.
And I've got to do something.

426
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:30,606
What did you say to that editor
who wanted you to write for him?
I haven't said anything yet.

427
00:31:30,607 --> 00:31:32,526
It's probably too late now.

428
00:31:32,527 --> 00:31:35,766
Matthew says Robert was against it.
What difference does that make?

429
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:40,326
Oh, really! My dear, ssh!
We're all family.
I'm not letting the side down.

430
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:46,807
I'm just saying Robert frequently
makes decisions based on values
that have no relevance any more.

431
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:52,966
Do you think I should do it?
I wouldn't countermand your father.

432
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:58,046
Then why bring it up?
Well, I do, and so does Matthew.

433
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:03,046
And so does Matthew what? What else
has Matthew decided for my family?

434
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,966
Robert? Don't worry,
I don't need to be fed. We're going.

435
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,046
All of you.
What are you talking about?

436
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:13,406
Do you know
who has prepared this luncheon?
Yes, Ethel, our former housemaid.

437
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,606
Who bore a bastard child.
W-what?

438
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:19,526
Robert, Ethel has rebuilt her life.

439
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:23,206
Do you know what she has built
it into? What do you mean?

440
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,487
I think cousin Robert is referring
to Ethel's work as a prostitute.

441
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:35,926
Well, of course, these days,
servants are very hard to find.

442
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:41,406
You don't understand the
difficulties she's faced. I couldn't
care less how she earns a living.

443
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:44,886
I care that you have exposed my
family to scandal. Who would know?

444
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:48,967
People find out these things.
Your gardener, your kitchen maid...

445
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:58,407
I suppose she has an appropriate
costume for every activity.

446
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:01,926
We are leaving.

447
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:07,206
Is this because of me, my Lord?
No, it's because of his Lordship.
We're not leaving.

448
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:10,526
Is that a Charlotte Russe?
How delicious!

449
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:13,007
I hope it's tasty, my Lady.

450
00:33:13,967 --> 00:33:16,046
Mrs Patmore gave me some help.

451
00:33:16,047 --> 00:33:20,167
I'm glad to know that Mrs Patmore
has a good heart and does not judge.

452
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,167
Is anyone coming?

453
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:30,927
Seems a pity
to miss such a good pudding.

454
00:33:49,047 --> 00:33:52,367
Who got Mrs Bartlett to change
her evidence? Who's Mrs...

455
00:33:54,487 --> 00:33:58,406
Durrant. Now Durrant is going to
tell her the police are on to her.

456
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:02,686
She'll wind up inside
if she doesn't change her story.
To what? The truth!

457
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:07,966
Or else what? I tell the governor
you and Durrant are bringing
in drugs. That's a lie!

458
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:12,247
Durrant will lose his job and you
will stay here five years longer.

459
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:24,126
No. He went down there and told
them, and none of them came away.

460
00:34:24,127 --> 00:34:27,126
Not even the Dowager? My, my.

461
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:31,246
Perhaps the world is becoming
a kinder place. You say "kinder".

462
00:34:31,247 --> 00:34:33,966
I say "weaker"
and "less disciplined".

463
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:39,526
Well, if her Ladyship is prepared
to visit Crawley House, I dare say
you won't object when I do.

464
00:34:39,527 --> 00:34:42,406
I won't forbid it
because I have no right to do so.

465
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,527
But I do object,
with every fibre of my being.

466
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:48,847
You disappoint me.

467
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:54,247
I never thought of you
as a woman with no standards.

468
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,966
I wish you'd come back
to the drawing room.

469
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,966
I'd only set your mother's teeth
on edge.

470
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,966
She'll come through it.

471
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,567
She will.

472
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:13,246
Which brings me
to your... performance today.

473
00:35:13,247 --> 00:35:15,606
How did that help?

474
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:19,966
I was angry with Isobel
for exposing you all to gossip.

475
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,246
You were angry all right.

476
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:24,647
But not with Isobel or Ethel.

477
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:29,326
I think it's because the world
isn't going your way.

478
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,166
Not any more.

479
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:34,486
Has Matthew told you about
his latest plans for Downton?

480
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:37,686
I know he wants to change things.
Doesn't he just?

481
00:35:37,687 --> 00:35:41,966
You mustn't let him upset you.
He more or less told me
I've let the estate fall to pieces.

482
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:44,487
I'm sure he didn't mean that.
Didn't he?

483
00:35:45,327 --> 00:35:48,166
A fool and his money
are soon parted.

484
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:52,527
I have been parted from my money,
so I suppose I am a fool.

485
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:57,407
You won't win over the christening.

486
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:02,166
Not if you're against me.
I'm never against you.

487
00:36:02,167 --> 00:36:04,847
But you've lost on this one.

488
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,607
Did Sybil truly not mind?

489
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,927
She wanted Tom to be happy.

490
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:16,046
She loved him very much, you know.

491
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:18,127
We all need to remember that.

492
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,007
I keep forgetting she's gone.

493
00:36:25,527 --> 00:36:28,887
I see things in the paper
that would make her laugh.

494
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:34,406
I come inside to tell her
that her favourite rose is in bloom.

495
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:36,487
And then, suddenly...

496
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,846
Say that to Mama.

497
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,726
Please.

498
00:36:46,727 --> 00:36:49,927
She doesn't want to hear it from me.

499
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:07,842
How's she doing?

500
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,339
She's blooming.

501
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:37,458
They STAYED in the house,
even after they knew?

502
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:40,818
I expect they didn't want
to insult Mrs Crawley.

503
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:44,058
I couldn't have swallowed
another bite once I knew.

504
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,298
Jesus managed to eat
with Mary Magdalene.

505
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:51,338
We can't be sure he ate with her.
He allowed her to wash his feet.
I see.

506
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:55,579
Well, I'll tell Ethel
she has a treat in store!

507
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:59,458
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry, but...

508
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:02,698
Ivy! We haven't finished yet.

509
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,379
We've never finished.

510
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:08,778
What's this?

511
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,618
Rouge?

512
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,058
Have you been painting your face?

513
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:16,338
It's not like the old days,
Mrs Patmore. All the girls do it.

514
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:19,338
Not in THIS house, Miss Hussy.
Go and wash!

515
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,739
We'll see no more of it.

516
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:27,818
It's nice to know we've another
piano player in the house.

517
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:29,818
Unless you think it's too soon.

518
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:33,778
Oh, no.
Lady Sybil was a bright young thing.

519
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:37,938
She'd be glad of some music.
You play well, James.

520
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:41,139
There's no end to Jimmy's talents,
is there?

521
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,579
His Lordship wants you.

522
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:53,738
I wish he wouldn't do that.
What?

523
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:57,738
He's always touching me. I'm going
to tell Mr Carson. You'd never.

524
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:00,739
I'd tell the flippin' police
if it'd make him stop.

525
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:04,578
I must go.
I need to fetch some linen.

526
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:06,779
Her Ladyship won't be long now.

527
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:19,138
What are you doing?

528
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,658
Nothing.
It didn't look like nothing.

529
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,618
Can you dance the foxtrot?

530
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:26,098
I think so. Yeah, I can.

531
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,178
Would you teach me?

532
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,498
Well, I'm supposed to lay the tea.

533
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:33,619
And here's me thinking
you'd like to dance with me.

534
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:37,658
Go on, then.

535
00:39:37,659 --> 00:39:39,978
How do you put the hands?
Like this.

536
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:43,338
That foot goes back first.

537
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,458
Right?
Yeah. It goes slow, slow...

538
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,618
quick, quick, slow.

539
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:54,058
Slow, quick, quick, slow.

540
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,579
Slow, quick, quick.

541
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,338
M'lady, it's arrived.

542
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:15,458
It's here. I wanted you to be
the first to know. What's arrived?

543
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:17,778
He's done it. Mr Murray's done it.

544
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:23,018
He's got her to make a statement,
witnessed and everything.
So when will Bates be set free?

545
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:27,098
It'll take a few weeks for the
formalities, but he'll be released.

546
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:31,458
Mr Murray's quite clear about that.
So Mr Bates is coming home.

547
00:40:31,459 --> 00:40:34,458
Oh, I'm so, so happy for you.
I know you are.

548
00:40:34,459 --> 00:40:37,058
Have you told Papa?
Not yet, m'lady.

549
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,738
Well, do. Please do.
He's very low just now.

550
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:43,219
It will be wonderful for him
to hear something good.

551
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:52,899
Have you seen this note from Mama?

552
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:57,578
I have. I wonder what she wants.

553
00:40:57,579 --> 00:41:01,379
I can stand anything
but a lecture on marital harmony.

554
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:09,339
Do we have to go?
I think so. We needn't stay long.

555
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,499
Good.

556
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,139
You look very nice this morning.

557
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:20,139
Don't flirt with me, Robert.
Not now.

558
00:41:31,459 --> 00:41:37,818
I'm ever so sorry to interrupt,
my Lord, but Mrs Bartlett has given
a statement that'll clear him.

559
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:42,338
At least, Mr Murray says
it will "make the verdict unsafe".

560
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,058
So Mr Bates is coming back
to Downton.

561
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,378
Isn't it marvellous?
Yes, that is absolutely marvellous!

562
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:51,898
Do you want to telephone Murray?
If you do, tell Carson.

563
00:41:51,899 --> 00:41:54,779
He'll manage it for you.
Why? Are you going out?

564
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:59,818
Your grandmother has asked us to
call. I'll hear what he says later.

565
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:02,699
I really am so very glad.

566
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:11,738
Excuse me!
What are YOU doing here?

567
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:14,538
I'm sorry, Mr Carson.
I want to thank Mrs Patmore.

568
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,218
I brought these flowers. There are
plenty in the gardens here.

569
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,258
How nice of you, Ethel.

570
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:22,659
Mrs Patmore is in the kitchen.

571
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,898
I hope YOU never need a favour
from your fellow man.

572
00:42:27,899 --> 00:42:31,738
You can talk as tough as you like.
I know YOU won't abandon me.

573
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:37,379
Why doesn't that thought
make you kinder?
Because I am who I am, Mrs Hughes.

574
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:43,739
Slow, slow, quick, quick. Go back.
Slow...

575
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:49,018
Look at the pair of you.
Alfie's learning the foxtrot.

576
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:52,338
I bet he is, but he's going to have
to do better than that.

577
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:56,018
What do you mean? He's only
learning it to please our Ivy.

578
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:58,378
Aren't you, m'laddo?
Is that true?

579
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,978
Well... Of course it is,
you runner bean.

580
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,739
Step aside,
let me show you how it's done.

581
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:14,378
What is going on here?

582
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,378
At a time like this,
of sober dignity!

583
00:43:17,379 --> 00:43:21,738
Have you lost all sense of shame
and propriety, sir?

584
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,938
What makes you think
you're the stuff of a first footman?

585
00:43:24,939 --> 00:43:27,818
Alfred looks like
a first footman to me.

586
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:31,738
Take a leaf from his book and learn
to conduct yourself with discretion.

587
00:43:31,739 --> 00:43:34,738
But, Mr Carson, he was the one...
Silence.

588
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:37,298
You're a disgrace to your livery.

589
00:43:37,299 --> 00:43:39,978
And as for you, Daisy,

590
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:42,819
have your years here
taught you nothing?

591
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,859
Thanks for speaking up

592
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:57,818
I don't suppose you want
to practise... I'm very busy.

593
00:43:57,819 --> 00:44:00,979
Why don't you ask Ivy
if she's got any spare time?

594
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:12,338
Dr Clarkson!
Lady Grantham, how are you?

595
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:14,818
Much as you'd expect me to be.

596
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:19,658
Dr Clarkson has something
to tell you which may alter
your view a little.

597
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:23,018
I don't mean to be discourteous,
but I doubt it.

598
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:27,098
Since you're here,
I have a few words of my own to say.

599
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:30,458
I feel I owe you an apology.
Please, Lord Grantham.

600
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,699
If you'll just allow me.

601
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:36,258
On that awful night...

602
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:41,458
I'm afraid I may have given you
the impression that my recommended
course of treatment

603
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:44,539
offered a real chance
for Lady Sybil's survival.

604
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:50,738
The truth, and I've done
a great deal of research since,
as you can imagine,

605
00:44:50,739 --> 00:44:53,459
is that the chance was a small one.

606
00:44:55,019 --> 00:45:01,178
A tiny one, really. I'd read
that early delivery was the only way
to avoid the trauma, and it is.

607
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:03,499
As you tried so hard to tell us.

608
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,818
But... what I did not quite realise

609
00:45:07,819 --> 00:45:11,378
was that eclampsia
is almost invariably fatal,

610
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:13,659
with or without a Caesarian.

611
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:21,698
Had you agreed, we would have
subjected Lady Sybil to the fear
and pain of a hurried operation.

612
00:45:21,699 --> 00:45:25,978
When, in all likelihood,
she would have died anyway.

613
00:45:25,979 --> 00:45:27,298
But...

614
00:45:27,299 --> 00:45:29,259
there was a CHANCE.

615
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:36,458
An infinitesimal one.

616
00:45:36,459 --> 00:45:41,178
The discomfort and the terror
would have been all too certain.

617
00:45:41,179 --> 00:45:45,538
So you think Tapsell was right?
Oh, I can't go that far.

618
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:51,618
Sir Philip Tapsell ignored
all the evidence in a most unhelpful
and arrogant manner.

619
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,779
But Sybil was going to die.

620
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:02,458
When everything is weighed
in the balance,

621
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:06,339
I believe that Lady Sybil
was going to die.

622
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:15,779
And now I'll take my leave.

623
00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:49,018
It seems so strange without Sybil.
She's watching, I know.

624
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:54,098
Welcome back, Mr Bates! He can't
have expected to stay my valet.

625
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:58,018
I believe I can make Downton safe
for our children. What about Papa?

626
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:03,898
Downton has existed for hundreds
of years. Must I remind you
of the state the place was in?

627
00:47:03,899 --> 00:47:06,378
The editor's written back
repeating his offer.

628
00:47:06,379 --> 00:47:09,898
I assume your father disapproves.
It's the business
of parents to worry.

629
00:47:09,899 --> 00:47:13,258
I know what's going on. What are you
going on about? He's a ladies' man.

630
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:15,579
Alfred says he's always going on
about you.

631
00:47:15,604 --> 00:47:17,269

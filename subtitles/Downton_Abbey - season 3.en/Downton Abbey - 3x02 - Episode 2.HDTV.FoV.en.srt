3
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:44,558
Who will groan first when they
see it, Granny or Papa?

4
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,119
I should think they'll
howl at the moon in unison.

5
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,599
What in God's name is this?

6
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,238
Well I never!
Where did this come from?

7
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,278
I ordered it in London,
picked it up on the way back.

8
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,598
It's an AC.
Well, at least it's English.

9
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,558
Welcome back, my darling.

10
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:23,358
How was the honeymoon? My eyes
have been opened. Don't I know it!

11
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,439
Anna get back all right? Yes.

12
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:32,318
Who's that for? Why are you
doing it down here?

13
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,678
It's for Mr Matthew.
It was creased, I'm ironing it.

14
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,518
You're never looking after him?
What about Mr Molesley?

15
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,998
He's staying at Crawley House.
Why wasn't I asked?

16
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:47,239
Mr Carson thought it best. Did he?
I wonder how that came about?

17
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,478
If you're learning your job,
never open a shirt in a room

18
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,438
where it might be marked,
let alone put studs in it.

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,278
Do that in a dressing room
and nowhere else. Thank you.

20
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:02,959
Yes, you're always trying to be
so very helpful.

21
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:10,038
How did you enjoy the south
of France? It was lovely,

22
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,078
but almost too hot, even now.

23
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,638
It's a shame they close things
in the summer. I love the sun.

24
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,158
So we can see. You couldn't be in
Cannes in summer, it's unbearable.

25
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,438
I could. Just how long
is she here for?

26
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,318
Who knows? No guest
should be admitted

27
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,038
with no departure date settled.

28
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,238
You won't get any argument from me.

29
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,278
There's a hideous pile of post.
I've put it on the hall table.

30
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:39,318
Don't look at it tonight.
What have you been up to?

31
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:42,638
I've found myself a new occupation,

32
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,198
but Violet
doesn't think it's appropriate.

33
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,318
Can we talk about it afterwards?

34
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,359
Are there still forbidden subjects
in 1920? I can't believe this.

35
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,758
I speak of taste rather than law.

36
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,399
Well, it's not my taste.

37
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,838
What about you, Cora?
I agree with Mama.

38
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:05,278
Some subjects are not suitable
for every ear.

39
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:08,478
Oh, pas devant les domestiques.

40
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,118
Come on, my dear, Carson and Alfred

41
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:13,879
know more about life
than we ever will.

42
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:19,599
Can't we stop this? How?
She's like a runaway train.

43
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:23,598
Shall we go through?

44
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,998
What about poor old Strallan?
Have you seen him?

45
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,639
Why do you call him
poor or old? He's neither.

46
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:35,918
Isn't it dangerous to let
this Strallan nonsense simmer on?

47
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,158
To be fair, I don't think it's
coming from him. Ask him to end it.

48
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,079
He'll be more effective
than if we try.

49
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,278
Ooh, she ate it, then?

50
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,558
Never sure about Americans and offal.

51
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,038
She'll eat whatever you
put in front of her. What a gob.

52
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,798
Mr Carson was going to put a bag
over her head.

53
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,278
Oops. Mrs Levinson
knows you make fun of her

54
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:04,078
because she makes fun of you.
We're all square, then.

55
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,118
It's not drying properly,
the oven's not hot enough.

56
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,639
A bad workman
always blames his tools.

57
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:14,958
Are you busy? No. We're eating
in half an hour but it's all done.

58
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,039
Well, if you could spare a minute.

59
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,958
This is very good, you didn't open
it for me. Certainly I did.

60
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,439
To welcome you into this house
as my son.

61
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,319
I can't tell you
how glad it makes me.

62
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,718
I want us always to feel we can be
honest with each other.

63
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:42,439
Of course. Because Mary's told me
about your present difficulties.

64
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,558
Oh, she was right,

65
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:50,399
losing Downton will affect you both
more than anyone.

66
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,039
Has she told you about
the will of Lavinia's father?

67
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,598
Yes, your father told me
all about it,

68
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,558
but I cannot understand why so
much money was put into one company.

69
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:08,878
I couldn't agree more. Now we're
to be turned out of Downton.

70
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,118
Even Lloyd George can't want that.

71
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,279
I'm not sure he's a good example.

72
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,198
The point is have we overlooked
something,

73
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,479
some source of revenue
previously untapped?

74
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,558
If only we had some coal,
or gravel, or tin.

75
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,238
I can think of someone
who's got plenty of tin.

76
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:35,678
So you help women who have...
fallen over?

77
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:40,238
Not quite. Isabelle helps women who
have to degrade themselves

78
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,918
to survive.
There's a centre in York.

79
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,078
No addresses, please.
Alfred will make notes.

80
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,798
What do you do for these women?
First, we like to send them away...

81
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,798
to rest. I should think
they need it.

82
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:58,758
And then we try to find them
alternative employment.

83
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,958
The War destroyed many households,
thousands of bread winners died.

84
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,399
So you want me to contribute?

85
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,158
You don't have to give money
after every conversation. No?

86
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:14,039
Isn't that what the English expect
of rich Americans?

87
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:20,038
Why can't you benefit from the will?
You've done nothing wrong.

88
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,478
He didn't know I'd broken
his daughter's heart.

89
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,718
It was to reward my fidelity

90
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,758
when in fact I'd betrayed her.

91
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,999
If I kept that money, I'd be
no better than a common criminal.

92
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,638
I see.

93
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,079
If that's how you feel,
there's no more to be said.

94
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,398
I'm ever so sorry, my lord,
I thought you were out of here.

95
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,519
We should be. Please.
We're going now.

96
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:54,639
It's a lump, there's no point
dithering about that.

97
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:59,118
What are you going to do about it?
I don't know.

98
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:04,918
Tomorrow, you'll make an appointment
with the doctor and see what he says.

99
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,158
But what if it's...
If it is, and I'm not saying it is,

100
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,959
it's best to know now.

101
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:15,478
I suppose so.

102
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,279
Now, look, you'll not be alone for
a minute if you don't want to be,

103
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,719
but we have to get it seen to.

104
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,839
Then there's expense.

105
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,039
If you must pay money, better
to a doctor than an undertaker.

106
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,158
If that's an example of your bedside
manner, Mrs Patmore,

107
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,679
I think I'd sooner face it alone.

108
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,638
It seems shocking for Anna
to find me en deshabille.

109
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,679
I'm made of stout stuff, sir,
don't worry about that.

110
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,398
Are you seeing Bates today?
I am, and I can't wait.

111
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,519
Give him our best wishes.

112
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,079
It still seems odd
to be found in your bed.

113
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,919
But very nice.
Oh, as nice as nice can be.

114
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,638
I'm going to see Jarvis today

115
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,198
and find out what houses
are available. Do you have to?

116
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,558
These are our last days here. I
thought something might've turned up

117
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,118
while we were away
but it seems it hasn't.

118
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:36,318
Would you rather wait till we have
to go and find a new house then?

119
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:40,639
After all, darling, you're the one
who's pushing us out.

120
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:56,546
Not for me, thank you.

121
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:10,361
But Mary's only just got back
from honeymoon.

122
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:13,561
It's her family time. But you are...

123
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,967
Stop saying I'm family when I'm not.

124
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,583
I'll be there
for the big dinner next week.

125
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:25,222
What is it? I know
you don't mean to hurt me, but...

126
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:29,142
Of course I don't. That's
the last thing I'd wish to do.

127
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:33,662
Then why do you shove me away?
I don't want to, not at all, but...

128
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:37,702
If you're going to talk about your
wretched arm again, I won't listen.

129
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:41,262
It's not just my arm.
I'm too old for you.

130
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,902
You need a young chap
with his life ahead of him.

131
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:49,382
Your life's ahead of you. If you
knew how much I want to believe that.

132
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,342
Then it's settled.

133
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:53,822
You're not going
to push me away any more

134
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:58,943
and you are coming for dinner
tonight. That's all there is to it.

135
00:10:07,303 --> 00:10:10,662
How did you get on with Vera's book?

136
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:13,982
I had a few answers
waiting for me when I got back

137
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:16,182
and two returned "address unknown".

138
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:20,262
Who from? Let me see, one was
a Mr Harlip, I think,

139
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:23,583
and the other was Mrs Bartlett.

140
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:28,862
He doesn't matter, he was a cousin
in the north, she never saw him,

141
00:10:28,863 --> 00:10:31,182
but Mrs Bartlett's a shame.

142
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:35,343
She lived on the corner, she
was very friendly. I'll find her.

143
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:38,702
Tell me about France.

144
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:41,423
Did you eat frog's legs
and dance the can-can?

145
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:45,943
No, but I bought a garter.

146
00:10:51,543 --> 00:10:53,663
You've had no other symptoms?

147
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:56,222
Not that I'm aware of.

148
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,742
You're not feeling ill or tired?

149
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:01,702
I can't swear to not feeling tired

150
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,902
but nothing out of the ordinary.

151
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:05,942
Very well.

152
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:09,382
I'm going to conduct
a preliminary examination.

153
00:11:09,383 --> 00:11:11,263
Do you mind if I stay?

154
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,103
I should prefer it.

155
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:21,142
What have you got there?
Mr Matthew's tailcoat.

156
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:24,062
What do you think that is?
Hard to say.

157
00:11:24,063 --> 00:11:26,622
I've tried everything
but I can't shift it.

158
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:30,822
I'll give you a tip, if you like.
Would you, really? Yeah.

159
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,983
Keep it to yourself, don't want
to give away all my secrets.

160
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,343
Oh, there you are, my dear.
Good morning, Granny.

161
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,822
I've been looking for you.

162
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:48,503
Now I want to know if we're serious,

163
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:52,982
about getting that woman, about
asking your other grandmother

164
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,262
to come to our aid.
She's made of money

165
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,542
and there's only Mama and Uncle
Harold to share it when she's gone.

166
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,822
We can't wait that long,
she'll bury us all.

167
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:05,302
No, we must act now.

168
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:10,462
We must make her feel
it is her duty to save Downton.

169
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:14,623
But how? What can we do?
Get her to sense its value,

170
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:18,022
its vital role in the area.

171
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:20,182
You're her granddaughter.

172
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:23,182
This will be your house
if it survives.

173
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:27,502
Surely you can make something
of that if she has a heart at all.

174
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,982
We'll come for tea this afternoon.

175
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,223
Then we can begin.

176
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:37,542
There are several stages to go
through before a cause for despair.

177
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:41,702
What stages? When you come back
in a day or two,

178
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:43,782
I'll remove fluid from the cyst.

179
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,062
With luck it'll be clear
and that will be that.

180
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,902
How will you do it? With a syringe.

181
00:12:49,903 --> 00:12:54,502
Will it hurt? Since he has to do
it, whether it hurts or not,

182
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,982
there's no point to that question.

183
00:12:56,983 --> 00:13:01,462
What I want to know is what happens
if the fluid is not clear?

184
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:06,383
It'll be sent away for analysis.
Because it may be... cancer?

185
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:12,182
It may be cancer
but I'm fairly certain it is not.

186
00:13:12,183 --> 00:13:17,423
There you are. It's very, very
unlikely, isn't it, Doctor?

187
00:13:18,743 --> 00:13:21,382
If the doctor treats me
like an adult,

188
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,863
why do insist on
treating me like a child?

189
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:31,023
Does this seem slow to you?
Not really.

190
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:37,343
Mrs Levinson's going to the
Dower House with the others for tea.

191
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:42,023
I think he likes me.

192
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,623
He's being friendly, that's all.

193
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:56,702
Are you all right? You seem to have
been slaving away for hours.

194
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:00,702
I want to be up to date
before I get back to the office.

195
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,543
Anything from Mr Swire's lawyer?

196
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,863
You can read it if you like.

197
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:14,622
So you are definitely
Reggie's heir?

198
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:18,582
Looks like it, but if they have
to get a death certificate

199
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:23,382
out of the Indian authorities, it
won't be settled by Tuesday. Good.

200
00:14:23,383 --> 00:14:27,622
Why is it good? The delay may give
you time to change your mind.

201
00:14:27,623 --> 00:14:30,382
Stop punishing me, Mary, please.

202
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:34,422
If I accepted the legacy, I'd take
money under false pretences.

203
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:38,502
I'd be stealing. Your father
understands now why can't you?

204
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,142
He doesn't understand,
he just doesn't want to beg.

205
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:45,583
Anyway, I'm off to Granny's for tea.
See you later.

206
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:50,662
I do love you so terribly much.

207
00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:53,463
Yes, I know you do.

208
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,102
So what's Harold doing now?

209
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:07,982
His idee fixe is yachts.

210
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,142
Bigger yachts, faster yachts.

211
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,502
Something with yachts.

212
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:16,262
Is he happy? He's much
too busy to find out.

213
00:15:16,263 --> 00:15:20,862
It always seems so strange to me
that Cora has a brother. Why?

214
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:25,062
If there's a boy, the daughters
don't get anything.

215
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:29,102
There's no such thing as
an English heiress with a brother.

216
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:31,222
Why do we never see him?

217
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:33,742
Harold hates to leave America.

218
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,982
Curious. He hates to leave America.

219
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:39,343
I should hate to go there.

220
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:42,222
You don't mean that, Granny,

221
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:44,503
when we're both so drawn to America.

222
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,703
Indeed, indeed we are.
Never more than now,

223
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:53,342
when the bond between the Crawleys
and Levinsons is so strong.

224
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,823
That's nice, if you mean it, Mama.

225
00:15:56,343 --> 00:15:58,102
I do.

226
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:02,542
It is marvellous the way
our families support each other.

227
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:07,902
You mean you needed the Levinson
cash to keep the Crawleys on top?

228
00:16:07,903 --> 00:16:10,182
I'm not sure we'd put it that way.

229
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:14,702
I'm quite sure we would not.
But I hope you feel Mama's fortune

230
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:19,463
has been well spent in shoring up
an ancient family. Hm.

231
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:22,863
You gotta spend it on something!

232
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:31,743
What happened here? I...

233
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:34,182
I just...

234
00:16:34,183 --> 00:16:38,062
You just what? There was a mark.
I know there was a mark,

235
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,222
but you didn't need to burn it away.
What have you done?

236
00:16:42,223 --> 00:16:46,502
I'll go down in my dinner jacket,
send it to my tailor in the morning.

237
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:50,183
Come on, nobody's died,
just find the dinner jacket.

238
00:16:52,743 --> 00:16:57,102
There don't seem to be any glasses
for the pudding wine.

239
00:16:57,103 --> 00:17:00,462
Are they having one tonight?
It's on the menus.

240
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:04,102
I don't write them
for my own amusement. I dare say not.

241
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:07,062
I am trying, and so far failing,

242
00:17:07,063 --> 00:17:11,302
to persuade his lordship to bring
the staff levels back up to snuff,

243
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:15,303
but until he does it is vital
that you pull your weight.

244
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:23,142
Newport's not a jungle, not at all,

245
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,022
but it is a little less formal.

246
00:17:26,023 --> 00:17:30,302
Matthew obviously wants you to feel
at home in his play clothes.

247
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:33,822
Don't blame me. Alfred and I
had a disaster earlier.

248
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:37,622
What happened? He managed
to burn a hole in my tails.

249
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,502
Don't worry, it can be mended.
Careful, Carson.

250
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:42,782
I beg your pardon, my lord.

251
00:17:42,783 --> 00:17:47,222
I like dinner jackets, sometimes
it's nice to be informal.

252
00:17:47,223 --> 00:17:49,622
Especially when a couple is alone.

253
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:53,902
People like us should lead the fight
to keep tradition going.

254
00:17:53,903 --> 00:17:58,022
If you mean we can never change,
I can't agree. Nor me.

255
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:02,222
Accepting change is as important
as defending the past.

256
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:05,662
The role of houses like Downton
is to protect tradition.

257
00:18:05,663 --> 00:18:10,062
That's why they're so important
to maintain. Don't you agree?

258
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:14,102
We must do everything in our power
to keep Downton going. Sure,

259
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:18,383
if you think it's worth it. Who's
coming to dinner next week?

260
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:23,502
Locals. We thought you'd like to see
Downton on parade.

261
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,582
That's right. I'm glad
we've planned a dinner.

262
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,023
We can show you
the real point of Downton.

263
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:33,342
I don't know what to say, Mr Carson.

264
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,622
What's going on here? Alfred has
embarrassed the family.

265
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:41,862
He forced Mr Matthew to appear
downstairs improperly dressed.

266
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:46,302
You make it sound quite exciting.
I will not tolerate vulgarity.

267
00:18:46,303 --> 00:18:49,343
I'm sure Alfred didn't mean to. Hm.

268
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:55,222
I asked Thomas... Hey, what's this?
The stuff you gave me

269
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:59,942
burned a hole in the tails.
I gave you some soda crystals.

270
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:02,622
If you use them wrongly,
it's not my fault.

271
00:19:02,623 --> 00:19:06,743
This is what comes of making him run
before he could walk.

272
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:14,982
If you want me to stay away
from her, I will.

273
00:19:14,983 --> 00:19:17,342
I know it sounds harsh.

274
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:19,622
Please, I understand completely.

275
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:23,702
Edith's your daughter, you don't
want her seeing an old cripple.

276
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:25,983
Now you're the one who's harsh.

277
00:19:26,903 --> 00:19:29,542
The trouble is
she calls round regularly.

278
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,902
I can hardly ask her
not to be admitted.

279
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:35,183
I suppose I could write to her.

280
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:40,182
I hope you won't feel
we can't be friends after this.

281
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:44,582
Let's leave it for a while. I'll
duck out of the dinner next week.

282
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,263
It might be best. Thank you.

283
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:54,542
That's the one you should've taken,
soda crystals.

284
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:58,903
But he didn't give me that,
he pointed to this one. I promise.

285
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:03,743
You don't have to promise,
I believe you.

286
00:20:07,197 --> 00:20:09,597
So you think he's not ready?

287
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:12,276
He's just a lad, my lord.

288
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:16,756
He can see to the odd visitor,
but permanent valet to Mr Matthew?

289
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:21,436
It's too much. I'm pretty sure Mr
Crawley'd rather manage on his own.

290
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,956
They wouldn't like that
downstairs, my lord.

291
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:26,036
I was afraid you'd say that.

292
00:20:26,037 --> 00:20:28,037
So what would you suggest?

293
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:31,636
Ask Mr Molesley to join us.

294
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:34,276
It'd be kinder to Alfred
in the long run,

295
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,997
kinder than asking
more than he can give.

296
00:20:45,237 --> 00:20:49,436
How is that poor footman? I thought
Carson would eat him alive.

297
00:20:49,437 --> 00:20:52,516
Very glum. To be honest,
he has been a clot.

298
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,476
I'll have to send the coat to London.
Get it done quickly.

299
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:59,516
This dinner has to be
the grandest of the grand.

300
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:03,076
What do you hope to show her?
Why Downton matters,

301
00:21:03,077 --> 00:21:05,356
why it mustn't fall apart.

302
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:08,156
Hasn't Cora had her share
of Levinson gold?

303
00:21:08,157 --> 00:21:10,556
What's left is headed for your uncle.

304
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:12,676
He's as rich as Croesus as it is.

305
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:17,156
So you mean to fleece her? Since you
could get us out of this hole,

306
00:21:17,157 --> 00:21:19,796
I won't take any criticism,
thank you.

307
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:24,236
Will she do it? Granny
will make her or die in the attempt.

308
00:21:24,237 --> 00:21:27,637
Now stop talking and kiss me
before I get cross.

309
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:33,757
You heard him,
you'll know at once.

310
00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:38,116
I wish you could get
those maids under control.

311
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:41,756
They've broken one of the serving
dishes this time.

312
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:45,956
We're short of a footman, a kitchen
maid and one house maid at least,

313
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:50,556
that's if Anna's to be a proper
lady's maid, what Lady Mary wants.

314
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:53,036
Naturally. She likes things
done properly.

315
00:21:53,037 --> 00:21:58,076
We can't do things properly until
his lordship allows us the staff

316
00:21:58,077 --> 00:22:00,796
or until you and
the blessed Lady Mary

317
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:04,116
come down from that cloud
and join the human race!

318
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:07,716
I can only suppose
you are over-tired. Good night.

319
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:10,076
You see, she...
Good night, Mr Carson.

320
00:22:10,077 --> 00:22:13,596
We will discuss the dinner
in the morning.

321
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,317
Hm.

322
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:20,757
And no, Mrs Patmore,
you may not tell him.

323
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:27,236
Oh. Have you finished
with Mr Matthew?

324
00:22:27,237 --> 00:22:30,836
I have. He's in the dining room.
You won't need

325
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:34,876
to attend to him again, Mr Molesley
is coming up from the village.

326
00:22:34,877 --> 00:22:37,876
Has Mr Matthew complained?
It's not your fault,

327
00:22:37,877 --> 00:22:41,957
we've hurried you along too fast.
You mustn't feel badly.

328
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:50,236
This is Thomas's doing,
but don't you fret,

329
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,357
I'll make him sorry.

330
00:23:14,197 --> 00:23:16,636
I'm on your side.

331
00:23:16,637 --> 00:23:19,037
I'm glad somebody is.

332
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:34,236
No Mary? She's a married woman now
so she can have breakfast in bed.

333
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:36,836
Hm. I'm sorry about your tails.

334
00:23:36,837 --> 00:23:41,116
Carson's sending them up
on the London train this morning.

335
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,356
They'll have to put a new panel in.

336
00:23:43,357 --> 00:23:47,596
We thought we'd get Molesley
to come and look after you.

337
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:50,356
He knows your ways.
I'm perfectly happy...

338
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:55,156
I think it best if he comes. I must
talk to you about the staff we need.

339
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:59,957
Not now, Carson. Send for Molesley
if Mrs Crawley has no objection.

340
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:05,717
Edith?

341
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:08,997
Oh, Papa, how could you?

342
00:24:14,157 --> 00:24:17,277
Crawley, do you know what that was?

343
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,877
I'm afraid I probably do.

344
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:26,356
I'm sorry but enough
of my father's money

345
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:28,916
has already been poured into Downton.

346
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:32,796
Why should Harold lose half
his inheritance for our folly?

347
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:36,556
So it's all Papa's fault? It isn't
my mother's or brother's.

348
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:40,516
I don't see why they should pay
for it. We'll still ask.

349
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:44,556
What are you so afraid of? If we
sell, we move to a smaller house

350
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:48,596
and a more modest estate.
We don't have to go down the mine.

351
00:24:48,597 --> 00:24:52,636
You don't understand. Mary, a lot
of people live in smaller houses

352
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:56,876
than they used to. Which shows
you're American and I'm English.

353
00:24:56,877 --> 00:25:00,916
I shall be Countess of Grantham
one day and the Countess of Grantham

354
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,157
lives at Downton Abbey.

355
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:15,597
'What job might you be suited to?'

356
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:21,317
We're not here to give you food, we
want you to find your place in life.

357
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,237
Do you want to speak to me?

358
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:30,157
Yes, Mrs Crawley, I do.

359
00:25:31,717 --> 00:25:35,757
Have you come for our help?
You're very welcome if you have.

360
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:40,237
Wait a minute, I know you.

361
00:25:41,277 --> 00:25:45,316
You were the maid who brought
your child

362
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:50,236
into the dining room at Downton.
Sorry, this has been a mistake.

363
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:54,277
I thought I was ready to ask you
but I'm not. I'm not ready.

364
00:25:54,437 --> 00:25:56,357
Ask me what?

365
00:26:01,997 --> 00:26:04,357
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, ladies.

366
00:26:05,477 --> 00:26:07,516
It's not quite as simple.

367
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:12,437
Oh, my God! Mrs Patmore, will you
please leave the hysteria to me?

368
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:16,276
I'm afraid the test
was inconclusive.

369
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:21,196
I had hoped the fluid from the cyst
would be clear but there's blood,

370
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:23,756
not enough to confirm the presence

371
00:26:23,757 --> 00:26:26,277
of cancer but too much
to exclude it.

372
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:29,756
So what happens now?

373
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:33,876
I send it away for analysis
and this stage will take some time.

374
00:26:33,877 --> 00:26:36,276
How much time?
Anything up to two months.

375
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:38,276
Oh, my...

376
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:41,876
Until then, try
to take it more easy.

377
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:44,356
Sit down and put
your feet up if you can.

378
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:46,596
Chance'd be a fine thing.

379
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:50,276
Would you like me to say something
to Lady Grantham?

380
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:54,916
No, thank you, Doctor, I'll speak
to her myself if I need to.

381
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,797
Thank you.

382
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:04,116
My darling girl, what's this?

383
00:27:04,117 --> 00:27:07,636
I think you know, since you asked
Sir Anthony to write.

384
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:11,276
Edith, you understand I only want
what's best for you.

385
00:27:11,277 --> 00:27:14,276
And you're the judge of that?
In this.

386
00:27:14,277 --> 00:27:17,716
Sybil marries a chauffeur
and you welcome him here,

387
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:23,236
but when I love a gentleman, you
cast him out. She has a point.

388
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:29,116
Strallan is certainly a gentleman.
Besides which he has a house,

389
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:33,716
he has money, a title, everything
that you care about.

390
00:27:33,717 --> 00:27:36,156
You make me sound very shallow.
Aren't you

391
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,836
when you make me give him up
because he has a bad arm?

392
00:27:39,837 --> 00:27:42,556
He's quarter of a century too old.

393
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:46,516
Did she tell you that?
Your daughter is sad and lonely.

394
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:49,996
Now I don't mean to interfere...
Don't you?

395
00:27:49,997 --> 00:27:53,556
If you ban him from Downton
I'll only go to his house.

396
00:27:53,557 --> 00:27:57,756
I don't believe he'd see you.
I'll wait outside until he does.

397
00:27:57,757 --> 00:28:00,356
How can you not like him
because of his age

398
00:28:00,357 --> 00:28:03,636
when almost every man
we grew up with is dead?

399
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:07,717
Do you want me to spend my
life alone? I do like him very much.

400
00:28:08,357 --> 00:28:11,477
So do I, Papa. So do I.

401
00:28:12,877 --> 00:28:15,476
Please, ask him back.

402
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:19,276
He writes he's not coming
to Mama's dinner. Please make him.

403
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:21,437
Please, please, please.

404
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,157
Oh, all right, then.

405
00:28:32,197 --> 00:28:34,796
I found Mrs Bartlett.

406
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:38,196
I wrote back to the tenant
of the house explaining

407
00:28:38,197 --> 00:28:40,996
and they sent me
a forwarding address.

408
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:43,476
I don't know why they didn't before.

409
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,996
But it doesn't mean
she'll talk to you. Why not?

410
00:28:46,997 --> 00:28:50,996
Audrey Bartlett was the nearest
thing Vera had to a friend.

411
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:54,796
That's why I want to meet her.
She won't see the real Anna Bates.

412
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,636
She's doesn't have to like me.
I need her to be honest.

413
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:01,116
I'm going to write
and ask for a meeting.

414
00:29:01,117 --> 00:29:03,356
I can get to London
and back in a day.

415
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,196
She won't agree.

416
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:09,356
I've the rent from the house,
I can make it worth her while.

417
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:11,156
Why do you think Vera

418
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:14,836
didn't go and see her instead
of sending that letter? Eh?

419
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,796
When Vera was frightened
about your visit

420
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:22,037
she wrote that letter saying how
scared she was instead of seeing her.

421
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,797
Maybe she did both.

422
00:29:27,837 --> 00:29:29,556
So...

423
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:31,556
what's the news at home?

424
00:29:31,557 --> 00:29:34,157
I shouldn't tell you, really.

425
00:29:35,277 --> 00:29:37,557
I haven't told any of the others.

426
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:41,237
It's breaking the code
of a lady's maid.

427
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,517
His lordship's in trouble.

428
00:29:46,357 --> 00:29:48,996
It seems he may have to sell.

429
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:52,317
What? Sell Downton?

430
00:29:54,517 --> 00:29:56,517
That makes me sad.

431
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,957
I wouldn't have thought much could
touch me in here, but that does.

432
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:24,476
It hasn't come. They promised
and promised and I thought

433
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:28,076
it was sure to be on the 7 o'clock
but it's not.

434
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,796
I'll just have to wear a black tie.

435
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:33,196
But Lady Mary, surely...

436
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:37,517
These things don't matter as much
as they did, Lady Mary knows that.

437
00:30:51,637 --> 00:30:54,636
Thank you. I know I'm early...

438
00:30:54,637 --> 00:30:57,877
Granny, come and see
what we've done. Oh.

439
00:31:02,837 --> 00:31:04,877
What do you think?

440
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:08,276
Nothing succeeds like excess.

441
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:11,916
When shall we tackle her?
After dinner.

442
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:15,916
We'll get her on her own. She
wouldn't want to see all this go,

443
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:17,996
now it's for her granddaughter.

444
00:31:17,997 --> 00:31:22,637
Never mistake a wish for
a certainty. Let's hope she won't.

445
00:31:26,077 --> 00:31:30,076
Mrs Patmore. What is it now?
It's smoking, the range.

446
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,356
The wind's in the wrong direction,
rake it through.

447
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:36,317
Where's Alfred?!
In the servants' hall.

448
00:31:38,717 --> 00:31:42,917
Where are they? His what?
His bloody evening shirts!

449
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:48,237
Where have you put them? I haven't
touched them. Why would I?

450
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:54,717
Have you done this? Why would I
know anything about his shirts?

451
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:59,916
When I find out... Keep your
histrionics to yourself. Hurry up.

452
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:04,317
Her ladyship's in the drawing room.
His lordship's not even dressed?

453
00:32:09,557 --> 00:32:13,596
You can't have lost them all.
I haven't lost any of them.

454
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:16,516
They've been taken
by someone, stolen.

455
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,757
Why would they do that?
To get at me.

456
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,596
Are you not popular downstairs?

457
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:25,797
I wouldn't say that, my lord,

458
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:29,356
but you know how people can be.

459
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:33,276
They like a little joke.
This is quite unacceptable.

460
00:32:33,277 --> 00:32:36,036
If you uncover the culprit,
refer them to me,

461
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,397
but for now what are we going to do?

462
00:32:55,517 --> 00:32:57,597
Good evening, Sir John.

463
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:06,476
It can't be going out. There must be
a block in the flue.

464
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:10,356
The dinner's not cooked,
we haven't put in the souffles.

465
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:14,356
There'll be no souffles tonight.
What on earth is going on?

466
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:17,916
We've 20 lords and ladies
in the drawing room

467
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:22,717
waiting for dinner and we've got
no dinner to give them. Oh, my God.

468
00:33:26,568 --> 00:33:28,687
Why are you not in white tie?

469
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:31,167
I'm afraid they never sent
my tails back.

470
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:34,747
You are not in white tie, either.
What have you come as?

471
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,288
I'm sorry, Thomas has lost my
dress shirts. Why is he still here?

472
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:42,745
I thought you gave him his marching
orders. I had.

473
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:46,985
My dear mother-in-law intervened.
I've a good mind to tell her...

474
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:50,305
No, she must have it
all her own way tonight.

475
00:33:50,306 --> 00:33:54,345
You two are dressed for a barbecue.
I feel like a Chicago bootlegger.

476
00:33:54,346 --> 00:33:57,865
That sounds almost
as peculiar as you look.

477
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:01,665
Come quickly. What is it?
The oven's broken down.

478
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,690
It can't have. What does that mean?

479
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:08,050
It means we have no food.
Oh.

480
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:11,570
Funny clothes and no food.
Should be quite an evening.

481
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,571
Thank you, Mother.

482
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:20,530
Nothing's cooked
and nothing's going to be cooked.

483
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:23,250
But surely...
Shall we tell them to go home?

484
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:27,010
No, they've come for a party,
we'll give them a party.

485
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,930
Clear the table,
go down to the larders,

486
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:33,290
bring up bread, fruit, cheese,
chicken, ham.

487
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:35,770
We're going to have
an indoor picnic.

488
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:38,890
They're going to eat whatever
they want, wherever they want.

489
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:42,202
Are you quite sure, madam?
It's not how we do it.

490
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,678
How you used to do it.
It might be fun. I agree.

491
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,958
We'll all pull together
and it'll be great fun. Yes!

492
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:53,438
I know what we need.
Does anyone play the piano?

493
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:56,198
This is so not
what we wanted it to be.

494
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,639
If it's the end of your undignified
campaign, I won't be sorry.

495
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:05,359
We can't just give up.
Certainly not.

496
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,758
Do you think I might have a drink?

497
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:12,279
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I thought you were a waiter.

498
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:18,958
Slice that finely, fetch some
parsley, cut the dry bits off.

499
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:21,358
Can I lend a hand?
I don't mind helping.

500
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,398
I think it's good to do other things
sometimes. I know you do.

501
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:29,558
There's not much left of this.
Cut it in squares, put it with ham.

502
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,358
You're very smart
in your valet's outfit.

503
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,798
Alfred, check the meat larder,

504
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,919
bring anything back you think
a human being could swallow.

505
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,198
Chop, chop, Mrs Hughes. We can rest
later but not yet. Mr Carson...

506
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,719
Mr Carson's right,
there's not a minute to lose.

507
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,719
Psst!

508
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:02,718
Do you want to know a secret?
The shirts Thomas thinks he stole...

509
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,798
I saw who took them
and I know where they are.

510
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:08,558
Who did take them?
Never mind that,

511
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,438
but I followed. I'll show you
if you want.

512
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:15,238
Why are you being so nice to me?

513
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:19,838
Because I like you. And you can
say it, just like that?

514
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,119
I'm an American, Alfred,
and this is 1920.

515
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,198
Time to live a little.

516
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,998
I thought you was trying to find
something about for Mrs Levinson.

517
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:35,718
Find out what when she reads them
like the palm of her hand?

518
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:38,878
She won't help, you know?
Help with what?

519
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,479
Never mind. Just kiss me again.

520
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,358
Now, all of you find whatever it is
that you want to eat

521
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,838
and take it wherever
you want to sit.

522
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,798
Anywhere? Anywhere.

523
00:36:56,799 --> 00:37:01,998
If you have ever wanted to explore
Downton, this is your chance.

524
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:05,478
I'm sorry if it's all a bit casual.
It's exciting.

525
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:09,438
I feel like the bright young people
they write about.

526
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:13,238
Thank you, Lady Mellendorf.
Cheer up, she won't be here forever.

527
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:16,398
How much damage will be done
before she goes?

528
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:20,838
♪ Let me call you "Sweetheart"

529
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,599

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,559

00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:59,159

♪ You ♪

538
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,799
Is there anything for our supper?

539
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:16,399
I've taken a veal and egg pie.

540
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,078
Oh, I wish you'd let me talk
to Mr Carson.

541
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,119
I don't want to be a sick woman in
his eyes for the next two months,

542
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:29,359
or a dying one in the months
to come after that.

543
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,999
Shh. I know it'll be all right.

544
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,998
No, you don't,

545
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,359
but I appreciate the sentiment.

546
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,478
Are you sure you won't wake up
in ten years

547
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,878
and wonder why you're tied
to this crippled codger?

548
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:53,478
Only if you keep talking like that.

549
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:56,119
Do you know how much you mean to me?

550
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,518
You have given me back my life.

551
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,359
That's more like it.

552
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,718
You won't wait? To give you
the chance to change your mind?

553
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:15,518
Don't worry, I can get it
organised in a month.

554
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,078
Shall we tell them tonight?

555
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,199
No, no, I'll come back
in the morning.

556
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:30,678
Can I ask you something? Why do you
like that American girl?

557
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:33,478
Steady. Who says I do? Don't you?

558
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:37,558
I suppose I do. And it doesn't
matter that she's fast

559
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:41,158
or that you won't see her again
after she's gone home?

560
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,198
She made me feel good about myself
for the first time here. Alfred!

561
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:49,838
Hurry up, I need you
to take around the claret.

562
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,238
Won't they spill it on the floor?

563
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,358
If you ask me, we are staring
into the chaos of Gomorrah,

564
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,678
but we have to give them more wine
and you are going to help.

565
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:04,678
What's that? I have to take it
upstairs for his lordship.

566
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,719
Well, be quick about it.

567
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,438
I'll help you any way I can.
Thank heavens.

568
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:16,318
It seems our family owes Downton's
survival

569
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,558
to the Levinsons not once but twice.

570
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,718
No. I'm so sorry,
but you've misunderstood me.

571
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:28,118
I cannot rescue Downton.
It's a shame if it has to go,

572
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,318
but I can't. But why not?

573
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,278
Because your grandpa
tied the money down.

574
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:37,438
He felt the Crawley family
had quite enough.

575
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:39,758
But you said you'd help us.

576
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:44,318
I can entertain all of you
in Newport and in New York

577
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,478
and I can add to Cora's dress
allowance, but that's all.

578
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,918
My income is generous
but I cannot touch the capital.

579
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:55,758
Besides, Mary,
the world has changed.

580
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:58,878
These houses were built
for another age.

581
00:40:58,879 --> 00:41:03,958
Are you sure you want to continue
with the bother of it all?

582
00:41:03,959 --> 00:41:09,319
Quite sure. If I knew I was going to
lose it, I'd look on the sunny side.

583
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:15,959
Both of our husbands tied the money
up tight before they were taken.

584
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,919
Lord Grantham wasn't taken.

585
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:22,719
He died.

586
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:40,438
I suppose it's scraps
for the servants tonight?

587
00:41:40,439 --> 00:41:42,559
Mrs Patmore's kept something by.

588
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:45,559
Who put them back?

589
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,878
What? The shirts,
who put them back?

590
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:53,798
They're back? You mean you
overlooked them in the first place.

591
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:55,838
Don't tell me what I mean.

592
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,958
I'm warning you. You sound like Tom
Mix in a Wild-West picture show!

593
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:05,999
Stop warning me and go lay out
his lordship's pyjamas.

594
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,598
What are you laughing at? Those
missing shirts went for a walk

595
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,759
and now they've come home.
Really? Have they?

596
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:26,999
You didn't see nothing. I agree.

597
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,639
Cos if you did I'll cut ya.

598
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,279
Oh!

599
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,919
Don't ever threaten me.

600
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:55,799
I forgot I was sharing a cell
with a murderer.

601
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,359
Don't forget it again.

602
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:15,719
This evening has made me homesick
for America.

603
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:18,519
It's time to go.

604
00:43:19,999 --> 00:43:23,198
I don't suppose you want some whisky
to take to bed?

605
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,359
Oh, but I'd love one. No water.

606
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,638
Thank you.

607
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:38,359
I'm sorry I can't help you
keep Downton, Robert.

608
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,878
That's what Mary wanted.

609
00:43:44,879 --> 00:43:46,599
Ah.

610
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:49,478
I thought there was something.

611
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:52,638
You know, the way
to deal with the world today

612
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,678
is not to ignore it. If you do
you'll just get hurt.

613
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:59,758
Sometimes, I feel like a creature
in the wilds

614
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:03,318
whose natural habitat
is gradually being destroyed.

615
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:06,918
Some animals adapt
to new surroundings.

616
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:09,479
It seems a better choice
than extinction.

617
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:13,118
I don't think it is a choice.

618
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,439
I think it's what's in you.

619
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:20,398
Let's hope that what's in you will
carry you through these times

620
00:44:20,399 --> 00:44:22,319
to a safer shore.

621
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:38,558
Is everything all right?

622
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:40,319
Certainly.

623
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,999
Was there something you wanted?

624
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,718
The kitchen managed well tonight
in difficult circumstances.

625
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:52,039
His lordship sent his thanks.

626
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,398
Was the evening a success?

627
00:44:55,399 --> 00:44:58,478
The odd thing is I think it was.

628
00:44:58,479 --> 00:45:01,518
For me, everyone sprawled
on the floor

629
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:06,238
eating like beaters at a break
in the shooting isn't a party,

630
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,278
it's a works outing.

631
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:11,598
Where's the style, Mrs Hughes?
Where's the show?

632
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,078
Perhaps people are tired
of style and show.

633
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,198
Well, in my opinion,
to misquote Dr Johnson,

634
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,398
if you're tired of style,
you are tired of life.

635
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:25,199
Hm. Good night, Mr Carson.

636
00:45:26,879 --> 00:45:30,159
You'd say if anything
was wrong, wouldn't you?

637
00:45:31,279 --> 00:45:35,679
I know I've been a bit crabby,
but I am on your side.

638
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:39,079
Thank you for that.

639
00:45:55,959 --> 00:46:01,398
You've just missed an admirer.
Mr Carson says you did well tonight.

640
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:04,079
Oh. Did you tell him?

641
00:46:04,919 --> 00:46:06,639
No.

642
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:09,839
What is there to tell?

643
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:12,999
One day I will die.

644
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:15,958
And so will he. And you.

645
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:18,519
And every one of us under this roof.

646
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:25,119
You must put these things
in proportion, Mrs Patmore,

647
00:46:25,959 --> 00:46:28,079
and I think I can do that now.

648
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:44,958
'Something happening
in this house is about me.'

649
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:47,958
'Strallan is
the traditional choice.'

650
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:51,118
Edith is beginning her life
as an old man's drudge.

651
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,158
This is the moment you receive
a huge fortune to save Downton

652
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:59,158
and you give it away. I hope
you can understand... I'm trying.

653
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:03,198
Downton Place. Where am I to go?
We still own the village.

654
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,358
I could open a shop.
Fashionably late is one thing.

655
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,878
So it is Cancer? Don't say anything,

656
00:47:08,879 --> 00:47:11,639
'she'd hate to think
the doctor told you.'

657
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:15,669

1
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,640
The pains have stopped. Nothing will
happen yet.

2
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,540
Everything is fine.
(HE SIGHS WITH RELIEF)

3
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:04,965
You mean it was a false alarm? Not
exactly.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,560
These early labour pains show that
the womb is preparing itself for birth.

5
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:12,160
Dr Clarkson, I'm afraid Lord Grantham
doesn't enjoy medical detail.

6
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:14,240
The point is, can we all go back to
bed?

7
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,725
You can.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,885
And so can I. I'll see you out.

9
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,760
Sir Philip Tapsell will be here
tomorrow. Of course.

10
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,520
If you think it advisable.

11
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,400
There really is nothing wrong?
Nothing at all.

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,040
She a healthy young woman going through
a very normal and natural process.

13
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,160
I think I'd rather be in the city if
I were having a baby.

14
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,405
Where they've got all the modern
inventions.

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,400
Far away from everyone you know and
trust? I don't think I would.

16
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,845
What are you talking about having
babies for, Ivy?

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,680
I think we can leave that for a
little further down the menu.

18
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:49,725
It's always an idea to be prepared.

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,680
I expect you're always prepared? I
try to be, Mr Barrow.

20
00:01:53,715 --> 00:01:57,600
I don't like the direction this
conversation is taking.

21
00:01:57,635 --> 00:02:00,685
Could we all begin the day's tasks,
please?

22
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,120
And remember - Lady Sybil is in a delicate
condition, so no noise on the gallery.

23
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,645
It's exciting, though, in't it, to
have a baby in the house.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,600
It won't make much difference to you.

25
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,520
Now get back in the kitchen,
and do as you're told!

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,720
Well, I think that message got
through.

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,320
We can't risk her welfare to soothe
Clarkson's feelings.

28
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,880
I know. I like the old boy, but he
did misdiagnose Matthew,

29
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,920
and he did miss the warning signs
with Lavinia.

30
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,960
Thank you, O'Brien.

31
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,605
Is that fair?

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,160
He didn't wanna get Matthew's hopes up
when it wouldn't make any difference.

33
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,480
With Lavinia, the disease moved like
lightning.

34
00:02:40,515 --> 00:02:43,565
I know, I know. But even so...

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,920
Sir Philip Tapsell may have delivered
many lords and royal highnesses,

36
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,005
but he doesn't know US.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,040
I'll ask him to include Clarkson in his
deliberations. Will that satisfy you?

38
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,000
I suppose so.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,165
You look a bit puzzled. I am. Mr
Carson's asked me to wind the clocks.

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,680
You must be doing well.
In this house, that marks

41
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:08,160
you out as First Footman
more than anything could.

42
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:12,720
That's just it. I said thank you right
away, but I know nothing about clocks.

43
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:15,640
You'd better ask Mr Barrow. He's the
clock expert.

44
00:03:15,675 --> 00:03:17,797
He used to wind them, but of course

45
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:19,920
it's quite wrong for a valet to do
it.

46
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,165
Mr Barrow won't mind? Oh, no.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,400
I can see he likes you, and that's good,
since he's got the ear of His Lordship.

48
00:03:26,435 --> 00:03:28,765
Yes, I suppose he would have.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,080
I'd keep in with him if I were you.
I will.

50
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,040
Thank you. Think nothing of it.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm the size of a house.

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,565
My back hurts,

53
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,560
my ankles are swelling,

54
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,725
and my head aches.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,005
Honestly, I cannot recommend this to
anyone.

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,280
I am listening, but of course I'm
dying to start one of my own.

57
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,600
So, you're not waiting? Waiting for
what?

58
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:03,360
I don't know, but I did wonder.

59
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,920
Mary, you know what I said about the
baby being Catholic?

60
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,800
I've just realised that the
christening will have to be here.

61
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,217
In Downton.

62
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:14,565
Blimey.

63
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,800
I wanted the whole thing done in
Dublin.

64
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,760
Out of sight, out of mind.

65
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,325
But we can't wait forever.

66
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,685
We can't not christen it, the poor
thing.

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,200
You don't have to do this. It's your
baby too.

68
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,245
I don't mind.

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,840
I mean, I do believe in God, but all
the rest of it - vicars, feast days,

70
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,320
and deadly sins - I don't care about
all of that.

71
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,560
I don't know if a vicar knows any
more about God than I do.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,280
And I love Tom so very, very much.

73
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,680
I'll let you rest.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,080
And don't worry. I'll fight your
corner with Travis if it comes to it.

75
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,600
There. You feel a slight increase in
the resistance?

76
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:15,245
I think so. That's what you're
watching for.

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
Never go past the point where the
clock is comfortable.

78
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,485
You make it sound like a living
thing.

79
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,240
Clocks are living things. My dad was
a clockmaker.

80
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,365
I grew up with clocks. I understand
them.

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,360
Never wind them in the early morning
before a room has warmed up,

82
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,817
nor too late, when the night air
cools them down.

83
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:33,240
Find the time when the family's out
of the room.

84
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,285
ANNA: But I don't understand. Why
was I kept away from you until now?

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,000
Whatever the reason, it's over. The point
is someone has to question Mrs Bartlett.

86
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:51,720
You wrote and said she saw Vera on
the evening of the day of her death.

87
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:53,645
That's right.

88
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,580
She went for a walk. The door was
open, and she went in.

89
00:05:56,615 --> 00:05:59,445
She saw Vera was cutting pastry from
under her nails.

90
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,645
I wrote that because it was such a
strange detail for her to remember.

91
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,800
She was making the pie that she ate that

92
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:06,920
night when I was on the
train back to Downton.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,965
So, Vera planned this?

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,720
She meant for you to be imprisoned,
and hanged for her suicide?

95
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,525
It was her revenge.

96
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
And what a revenge, for both of us.

97
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,285
But they'll say you poisoned the
milk,

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,485
or the flour or something to catch
her after you'd gone.

99
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,780
They tested everything in the kitchen.

100
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:35,040
They said it was in the pastry,
where I couldn't have put it.

101
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,000
(SIGHS)

102
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Oh, I hope she's burning in hell!

103
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't go down that road.

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Once you do, there's no way off it.

105
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,280
I've been thinking about you since
we last met,

106
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,680
and wanted to know how you were
living.

107
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,725
I've not gone back to...

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,885
..doing what I was doing, if that's
worrying you.

109
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,040
I've no Charlie to feed, so now if I
starve, I starve alone.

110
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,325
I'd rather starve than do that.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,680
You see...I thought you might work
here for a while.

112
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,725
Helping Mrs Bird.

113
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,600
It would mean that when you moved on
you will have had a respectable job

114
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:20,805
with a respectable reference.

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,445
Are you sure you've thought about
this, ma'am?

116
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,600
What will Mrs Hughes' reaction be, or
Lady Grantham's?

117
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:28,605
And old Lady Grantham?

118
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,240
I can't wait to hear what she has to
say about it.

119
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,200
Don't you want to come?

120
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,125
It's not that, ma'am.

121
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,960
You're offering a return to a wholesome
world, and I am very, very grateful.

122
00:07:39,995 --> 00:07:41,525
Well, then?

123
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,200
But I think it's going to be a lot
more complicated than you allow.

124
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:48,840
Then we shall have to face those
complications together, shan't we?

125
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
I'll take him from here. Sir.

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,765
Bates seems very cheerful. Is he?

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,080
He has a visit from his wife earlier.
She must have brought him some good news.

128
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,085
It hardly seems fair, does it?

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,205
You've got an extra year, and I've
got a formal reprimand,

130
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,520
and Mr Bates, who's done it all, who's

131
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,800
made all the trouble
for us, gets good news.

132
00:08:12,835 --> 00:08:14,805
What do you think it is?

133
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,440
She can't be pregnant. He was
arrested a year ago.

134
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:20,040
She might be, but he wouldn't be very
happy about it.

135
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,640
So, what do you wanna do? Um...

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,040
It'll need some thought. First, what
does this good news consist of?

137
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,920
When you shared with him, where did
he keep his letters?

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,280
Quite a few of the cottages have
been renovated.

139
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:40,520
Thanks to you. Maybe a little thanks
to me.

140
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,280
But many of the farms have been left
entirely to their own devices.

141
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:48,360
Coulter hasn't farmed this properly
for 20 years.

142
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,360
He struggles to pay the rent, which
is too low anyway.

143
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,120
There's been no...investment.

144
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,560
Papa would say you can't abandon
people just because they grow old.

145
00:08:59,595 --> 00:09:02,280
I agree, but it would be cheaper to
give him a free cottage,

146
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:04,605
and work this land as it should be
worked.

147
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,165
I see. And you don't think Papa
understands that?

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Maybe he harks back to a time when
money was abundant.

149
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:13,245
There wasn't much need to keep on
top of it.

150
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,360
I think he equates being
business-like with being mean.

151
00:09:16,395 --> 00:09:18,840
Or worse, middle-class like me.

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,000
The middle classes have their
virtues, and husbandry is one.

153
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,120
We ought to get back. Sir Philip
thingy's due on the seven o'clock train.

154
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:32,320
You ought to be there to hold Tom's
hand.

155
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,365
Poor fellow.

156
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,240
He's so terrified, and so thrilled
at the same time.

157
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:39,240
As I would be.

158
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
As I WILL be.

159
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,200
The dear Duchess of Truro is full of
your praises, Sir Philip.

160
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,245
Then of course, you know that.

161
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,840
She had quite a time when she was
first married, but I said to her,

162
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:01,400
"Never fear, Duchess, I'll get a
baby out of you one way or another."

163
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,045
And so you did.

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,520
Three boys, and as a result, a
secure dynasty, I'm glad to say.

165
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,645
But you see no complications here?

166
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,720
None at all. Lady Sybil is a perfect
model of health and beauty.

167
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,640
We told our local doctor
we'd send a message

168
00:10:21,641 --> 00:10:24,040
to him when it looks
as if the baby's coming.

169
00:10:24,075 --> 00:10:26,920
Dr Clarkson has known us all since
we were girls.

170
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:33,160
Yet what's needed here, Lady Mary, is
a knowledge of childbirth, nothing more.

171
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:36,760
But if it soothes you, then of
course.

172
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,600
He's most welcome.

173
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,885
I'm going to check on Sybil.

174
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,760
Sorry to trouble you, My Lord, but I
wondered if I might have a word?

175
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,525
Come into the library.

176
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,480
Matthew, will you take Sir Philip to
the drawing room?

177
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,965
Shall we go in?

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,640
Sir Philip, I was rather hoping to
have you to myself for a moment.

179
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,125
Do you know that I was injured
during the war?

180
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,960
I think I did hear something about it
from Lady Grantham.

181
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,600
My spine was very severely bruised,

182
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,400
and for a time it seemed I'd lost
the use of my legs,

183
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,805
and...

184
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,445
everything else.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
But the bruising reduced, and you
recovered? I have heard of this.

186
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,965
Well, how relieved you must have
been.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,440
Yes, but I wonder now whether the
injury might have...

188
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,840
affected my...

189
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,525
I suppose I mean my fertility.

190
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
If it may have limited my chances of
fathering a child.

191
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:45,680
Well, is...is everything working as
it should?

192
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,005
Yes.

193
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,925
Then um...

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,200
why do you think there may be a
problem?

195
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:55,040
We're anxious to start a family.

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,680
We've been married for a few months
without any...results.

197
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:01,725
My dear Mr Crawley,

198
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,080
may I point out the word that gives
you away?

199
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,805
Anxious.

200
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,220
Anxiety is an enemy to pregnancy.

201
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:13,600
Don't, whatever you do, feel anxious.

202
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,240
I can run a test if you wish, but I
would urge you

203
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,360
not to bother for some time yet.

204
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
There you are. We were wondering
what had happened to you.

205
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,360
This is extraordinary.

206
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,320
Why did the police miss it so
completely?

207
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,040
Mrs Bartlett never spoke to them.
She never spoke to anyone.

208
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,365
Except to you.

209
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,640
She didn't think the truth would
make any difference now.

210
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,165
She thought it was only further
proof of his guilt.

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,520
The difficulty is she may not want to
accept Bates' innocence.

212
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:52,845
Doesn't she have to? Not
necessarily.

213
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,840
She may think he drove his wife to
suicide, and deserves to rot in prison.

214
00:12:56,875 --> 00:13:00,640
In short, she may not wish to tell
the truth to set him free.

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,280
Then we need to get a statement from her

216
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:06,400
before she finds out it
could overturn the case.

217
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:10,760
I'll telephone Murray tonight. He can come
up here and talk to you, and see Bates.

218
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,805
You were right, though.

219
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,040
The proof was out there, and you
found it.

220
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,725
The editor of The Sketch wants me to
write for him.

221
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,680
He saw my letter to The Times, and
wants to give me a regular column.

222
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,200
How regular?

223
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:36,085
And what about?

224
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Once a week, and I can write about
whatever I like.

225
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,980
It would be the problems
faced by a modern woman

226
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,800
rather than the fall of the
Ottoman Empire, but even so.

227
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,160
Will you write under your own name?

228
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,005
I hadn't thought.

229
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,140
You won't have an option.
That's what he's buying,

230
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:54,240
that's what he wants
- your name and title.

231
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,440
I don't know. I thought Edith's letter
to The Times was very interesting.

232
00:14:00,475 --> 00:14:04,040
Don't bother, Matthew - I'm always a
failure in this family.

233
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm sad to hear this, Mrs Bird.

234
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,840
And I'm sad to say it, madam, but
it's kept me awake all night,

235
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:20,160
and I know I cannot work alongside a
woman of the...

236
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,080
..a woman who has chosen that way of
life.

237
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:26,765
But Miss Parks has changed.

238
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,760
Maybe she has and maybe she hasn't.

239
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,525
But if I tolerate her, I would be
tarnished by it.

240
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,520
Suppose people come to think that I'd
followed the same...

241
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:38,445
profession as what she has.

242
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,980
Nobody could look at you and think
that, Mrs Bird.

243
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:45,480
Well, I hope not, because I'm a
respectable woman.

244
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,920
I may not have much, but I have my
good name,

245
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,965
and I must protect it.

246
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
You'll have a month's wages in lieu
of notice.

247
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:58,160
Where will you go? Back to
Manchester.

248
00:14:58,195 --> 00:15:00,365
I can stay with my sister.

249
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,920
She says there's plenty of work for a
plain cook these days.

250
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:05,880
And they will find one in you.

251
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,440
Goodbye, Mrs Bird, and good luck.

252
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,205
Anything else you need to know about
having babies, Ivy?

253
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,640
Honestly, if I told
Mrs Patmore the things

254
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:21,040
you two say to me you'd
be up before Mr Carson.

255
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,045
What are you doing with your
afternoon off?

256
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,720
None of your business. I'd like to
make it my business.

257
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,520
Have you greased the cake tins? Yes.

258
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,125
What about the pastry?

259
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,560
It's in the larder. Get started on
the vegetables for tonight.

260
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,000
She doesn't want much, does she? She
doesn't like me.

261
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:42,040
Why not? I don't know.

262
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,605
She just doesn't.

263
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,960
Well, anyone who doesn't like YOU
needs their head examining.

264
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,080
I hope you agree with him, Jimmy?

265
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,040
That'd be telling.

266
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,240
Are we the first down?

267
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,920
How is Sybil? Sleeping, thank God.

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,200
She's been restless all afternoon.
I don't think it'll be long now.

269
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:07,525
I'm sorry it couldn't have been in
Dublin.

270
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,800
We know how much it meant. Nothing
means more than she does.

271
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,760
And you're sure you have everything
you need? Quite sure.

272
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:16,925
Hello, Granny. You're here. How nice.

273
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,440
Your grandmother will be with us
every night until the baby's born.

274
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:22,477
I hate to get news second-hand.

275
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:24,480
Well, you won't have long to wait.

276
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,525
I thought I'd bring up Dr Clarkson
after we've eaten.

277
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Yes, I've been talking to Lord
Grantham about the good doctor.

278
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:34,405
Sir Philip feels the room would be
too crowded.

279
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,720
It might be better to leave old
Clarkson out of it for the time being.

280
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,765
But I said I'd telephone.

281
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,040
Well, it really isn't necessary.

282
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:45,320
I've given him my word.

283
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,000
Why don't I run down in the car
after dinner, and fetch him?

284
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,680
The hollandaise for the fish, put it
in the sauce boats, and do the souffles.

285
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,560
As soon as - Will you just do it?!

286
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,360
Out of my way, quick.

287
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,080
What are you doing?

288
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,285
Haven't you done it? Oh, my God.

289
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,760
What's happened? It's curdled, and it's
got to go up in a minute. Oh, my Lord!

290
00:17:18,795 --> 00:17:22,600
Ivy can manage it. Go on with what
you're doing. Can you really?

291
00:17:22,635 --> 00:17:24,560
I can.

292
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,200
Now what? Give me an egg quick.

293
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,320
Dribble it in. But it's ruined. Do
what I say.

294
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,925
How does that work?

295
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,640
It's magic. It's one of the tricks of
the trade.

296
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,480
How have you done that? Just...one
of the tricks of the trade.

297
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,520
Well, go and take it up. Well done,
Ivy. You played a good one there.

298
00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:00,840
Thank her, Daisy. Yes, thank you.

299
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
That didn't hurt at all, did it?

300
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,080
I'll tell you what,
Daisy, Alfred won't like

301
00:18:08,081 --> 00:18:10,280
you any better for being rough on her.

302
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,120
I should have the fish. I'll do it.

(SIGHS) There's nothing more tiring
than waiting for something to happen.

304
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,485
Edith, have you written back to your
editor yet?

305
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,720
What's this? Edith has had an
invitation to write a newspaper column.

306
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,880
When may she expect an offer to
appear on the London stage?

307
00:18:41,915 --> 00:18:43,720
See?

308
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,280
Oh, God, is it beginning?

309
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,880
Dinner's suspended, so to speak.

310
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,040
Yes, but suspended cancelled, or
suspended keeping it hot?

311
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,000
What should I do about dinner down
here?

312
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:05,000
I couldn't tell you.

313
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,320
But...

314
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,725
What do you mean, concerned?

315
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,565
Lady Sybil's ankles are swollen. She
seems...muddled.

316
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,760
What sort of muddled? Not quite
there, not quite in the present moment.

317
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:22,920
And what do you think it means? It
means she's having a baby.

318
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,400
A word, Dr Clarkson.

319
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Excuse me.

320
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,645
Sir Philip mustn't bully him into
silence.

321
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,680
My dear, this is just Clarkson's
professional pride,

322
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:41,165
like barber's asking who last cut
your hair.

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,400
They always want to be better than
any other practitioner.

324
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,445
But we must listen to what he has to
say.

325
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,405
I quite agree. I don't want to hurt
Sir Philip's feelings.

326
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,500
If there's one thing
that I'm quite indifferent

327
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:55,560
to it's Sir Philip Tapsell's feelings.

328
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,000
You are upsetting these people for
no reason at all.

329
00:19:58,035 --> 00:19:59,885
I am not!

330
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,925
I think she may be toxaemic, with a
danger of eclampsia.

331
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,645
In which case, we must act fast.
There is no danger whatsoever.

332
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,200
Judging by my experience, Lady Sybil
is behaving perfectly normally.

333
00:20:11,235 --> 00:20:14,960
Do you not find the baby small? Not
unusually so.

334
00:20:14,995 --> 00:20:16,525
And the ankles?

335
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,280
Maybe she has thick ankles. Lots of
women do.

336
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:20,520
But SHE does not.

337
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm warning you, Doctor, if you wish
to remain,

338
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,885
you must be silent.

339
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,880
I cannot allow you to interfere.

Don't be burnt...

(SCREAMS)

344
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,280
Are you all right, Ethel? Only, I
heard a shout.

345
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,440
Fine, ma'am. Everything's fine.

346
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,960
It's a kidney souffle, ma'am.

347
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,820
A kidney souffle? Isn't that a bit
adventurous?

348
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:06,645
I've seen Mrs Patmore do it a hundred
times.

349
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Yes, but she can't have begun her career
as a cook by making a kidney souffle.

350
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,965
Shall I try something else, ma'am?

351
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,840
No, if we're to avoid a midnight
feast, it's...

352
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,960
..too late to turn back.

353
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,645
Is everything all right?

354
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,480
I think so. I've just come to fetch
some warm milk in case she fancies it.

355
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,685
Mr Carson?

356
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,680
I'm glad I've caught you.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,640
I've had a letter from Mrs Bird
who used to work for Mrs Crawley.

358
00:21:45,675 --> 00:21:48,680
I didn't know she'd gone. Well,
that's the point.

359
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,045
I've been thinking about what we
should do.

360
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,200
You know I have a brother in Liverpool,
and there might be an opening there.

361
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,320
It'd mean working with cars again -
No.

362
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
We're not going backwards. You must
promise me that.

363
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,165
(GROANS)

364
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,200
God, I wish there was something I
could do.

365
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,725
Just be here.

366
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,960
We can just lie back and look at the
stars.

Is she...?

369
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,640
It's all just as it should be.

370
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,365
Now what?

371
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,160
I want to test the latest sample of
her urine. Oh, for Heaven's sake.

372
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:35,520
Just give the order to the nurse,
please, Sir Philip.

373
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,645
How's the young mother doing? Am I
on duty, Dr Clarkson?

374
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,520
What? Only I swear I'm not on duty,
otherwise I wouldn't be lying here.

375
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
No. No, you're not on duty.

(HYPERVENTILATES)

378
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,765
Mrs Crawley has hired a prostitute to
manage her house.

379
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,600
And that's why Mrs Bird felt she had
no choice but to hand in her notice.

380
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:15,400
Nor did she, poor woman. Mr Carson,
this is Ethel we're talking about.

381
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,485
OUR Ethel.

382
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,940
And Mrs Crawley was just trying to give
her a helping hand. Is that so wrong?

383
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:26,360
I do not criticise her for her charity,
but she hasn't considered her actions.

384
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:29,560
No respectable person - certainly, no
respectable woman -

385
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:31,600
can now be seen entering her house.

386
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,845
But Ethel's given all that up.

387
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,160
I didn't think she was running a
brothel in Mrs Crawley's kitchen.

388
00:23:38,195 --> 00:23:40,605
Can't we say nothing for now?

389
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,880
Mrs Bird's gone, and I don't
remember Ethel as any great cook,

390
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:45,920
so it may sort itself out.

391
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:47,577
(SIGHS)

392
00:23:47,612 --> 00:23:49,165
Very well.

393
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,365
We shall keep silent. For the moment.

394
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,120
But I don't want the maids going into
that house on any pretext whatsoever.

395
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,125
Is that clear?

396
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,120
Quite clear, Mr Carson.

397
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,040
Or the footmen.

398
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,285
It's my belief that Lady Sybil is at
risk of eclampsia.

399
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,040
What is that? A rare condition from
which she is NOT suffering.

400
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:18,085
Tell him why you think she may be.

401
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,800
Her baby is small, she is confused,
and there is far too much albumen -

402
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:24,845
that is, protein - in her urine.

403
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,405
Dr Clarkson, please! Have you
forgotten my mother is present?

404
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,260
Please. A woman of my age can face
reality far better than most men.

405
00:24:33,295 --> 00:24:38,045
The fact remains, if I am right, we
must act at once. And do what?

406
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,040
Get her down to the hospital, and
deliver the child by Caesarean section.

407
00:24:42,075 --> 00:24:45,245
But is that safe? It is the opposite
of safe.

408
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,685
It would expose mother and child to
untold danger.

409
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,525
She could pick up any kind of
infection in a public hospital.

410
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,220
An immediate delivery is
the only chance of avoiding

411
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:55,880
the fits brought on by the
trauma of natural birth!

412
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,485
It may not work, but - Honesty at
last.

413
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,920
Even if she were at risk from
eclampsia, which she is NOT,

414
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,880
a caesarean is a gamble which might
kill either or both of them.

415
00:25:09,915 --> 00:25:12,040
I think we must support Sir Philip
in this.

416
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,080
But it's not our decision.

417
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:15,725
What does Tom say?

418
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,805
Tom has not hired Sir Philip.

419
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,280
He is not master here, and I will
not put Sybil at risk on a whim.

420
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:24,917
If you are sure, Sir Philip? I am
quite, quite certain.

421
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:28,520
You're being ridiculous. Obviously,
we have to talk to Tom.

422
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,920
Don't look at me. Cora is right.

423
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,080
The decision lies with the chauffeur.

424
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,765
How are things going? I'm not sure.

425
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,605
The doctors are arguing. That's never
a good sign.

426
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,840
Is everything all right?
Unfortunately, it seems it is not.

427
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,720
Could we get her to hospital? To move
her would be tantamount to murder.

428
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:58,517
Sir Philip, admit you're beginning
to detect the symptoms yourself.

429
00:25:58,552 --> 00:26:02,280
You can see her distress! Can you?
Yes, Lady Sybil is in distress.

430
00:26:02,315 --> 00:26:04,325
She's about to give birth.

431
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,085
Lord Grantham, Mr Branson, time is
running out.

432
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,480
We'd be at the hospital by now if we'd
acted at once. The baby would be born.

433
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:13,640
If she has the operation now, do you
swear you can save her?

434
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,600
I cannot swear it, no.

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,280
But if we do not operate, and I am right
about her condition, then she will die.

436
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:22,640
If, if! Lord Grantham, can you
please take command?

437
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:24,845
Tom, Dr Clarkson is not sure he can
save her.

438
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Sir Philip is certain he can bring
her through it with a living child.

439
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:31,165
Isn't a certainty stronger than a
doubt?

440
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,180
I don't mean to insult Sir Philip,
but Dr Clarkson knows Sybil.

441
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:37,160
He's known her all her life. So
you'd take her to the hospital?

442
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:40,200
I would've taken her an hour ago!
(SCREAMING)

00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,960
God help us!

444

(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

445
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,840
Any news from the house, ma'am?

446
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,885
Not yet.

447
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,160
Matthew said he would try and
telephone if it's not too late.

448
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,040
Lady Sybil was always kind to me.

449
00:27:04,075 --> 00:27:06,000
Yes, she's a very dear girl.

450
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,245
What...

451
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,520
What's in this?

452
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
Some honey. Was that not right?

453
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
It's perfectly fine for now, Ethel,

454

Would you like anything, Mama? No.

456

Just good news of the baby, and a
car to take me home.

457

I don't suppose I shall get either
before long.

What about you, Tom?

459
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:37,285
I just feel so helpless.

Yes, my darling?

Tom is thinking of getting a job in
Liverpool,

477
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,400
going back to being a mechanic, but
it wouldn't be right for him.

478
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,120

answer,

Your father loves you very much.

485
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:07,560
I know.

486
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,280
I know, and I love him terribly.

Tom and the baby if the time comes?

Of course. Lady Grantham?

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,400
Now sleep, darling.

490
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,765
I'm sorry we doubted. No.

491
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,525
As to that, Lady Grantham, it's
always a good idea

492
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,600
to forget most of what was said
during the waiting time,

493
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,560
and simply enjoy the result.

494
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,400
Is there anything more to be done?

495
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:53,725
Not really.

496
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,960
The nurse will stay with her, and so
I suggest we all get some sleep,

497
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:00,240
and meet again refreshed in the
morning.

Good news. Do you like Lady Sybil?

504
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,560
I do. We worked together in the
hospital during the war,

505
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:25,040
so I know her better than all of
them, really.

506
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,320
She's a lovely person, like you.

No, but Mr Barrow's so familiar all
the time, isn't he?

good sign.

If he's taken to you, he'll definitely
put in a good word with His Lordship.

00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:24,040
Of course, Mr Crawley.

616
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,040
I am very sorry to trouble you on a
day like this, Mrs Bates.

617
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:40,600
You weren't to know. None of us
could have known.

618
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,360
The men from Grasby's have arrived.

619
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,680
To take her away?

620
00:38:53,715 --> 00:38:55,685
Yes.

621
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,680
And we must let them.

622
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Goodbye, my darling.

623
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,520
She was the only person living who always
thought you and I were such nice people.

624
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,880
Oh, Mary...

625
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,400
Do you think we might get along a
little better in the future?

626
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:44,360
I doubt it.

627
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,560
But since this is the last time we
three will all be together in this life,

628
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:53,560
let's love each other now, as sisters
should.

629
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,560
You see, what I have discovered is
quite simple, Mr Murray.

630
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:20,960
It's proof of my husband's
innocence.

631
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:22,920
That seems a good place to start.

632
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,925
Yes, but the key to his innocence

633
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,240
depends on the word of a woman who
hates him,

634
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,600
and may want him to stay in prison
whatever the truth.

635
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,400
Why not tell me everything you know?

636
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,365
Of course, this isn't the right
time,

637
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,360
but you're here, and it's not a
subject for the telephone.

638
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:09,885
No, but I must confess to you, Mr
Crawley, that

639
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,840
even at this sad hour, your words are
music to my ears.

640
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,885
Testing times are coming for these
estates, indeed.

641
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,720
They've already arrived, and many
great families will go to the wall

642
00:41:22,755 --> 00:41:24,805
over the next few years.

643
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:29,320
It's never been more vitally important to
maximise the assets of a place like this,

644
00:41:29,355 --> 00:41:31,480
and run it with a solid business
head.

645
00:41:31,515 --> 00:41:33,440
What are you talking about?

646
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,120
Mr Crawley and I were discussing the
management of the estate.

647
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,925
He was outlining some interesting
plans for the future.

648
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,480
And do you intend to involve my
father in these fascinating plans?

649
00:41:45,515 --> 00:41:47,440
Of course.

650
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,660
Then I cannot think this
a very appropriate moment

651
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:53,320
to be deciding the destiny
of Downton, Mr Murray,

652
00:41:53,355 --> 00:41:56,857
when my sister's body has just been
removed from the house,

653
00:41:56,892 --> 00:42:00,360
and my father is quite unable to see
or speak to anyone.

654
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm really only here to talk to Mrs
Bates about her new evidence.

655
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:10,165
Naturally, if I'd known...

656
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,285
No, no, that's quite different.

657
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,640
None of us would wish to keep Bates in
prison for an hour longer than necessary.

658
00:42:16,675 --> 00:42:19,280
Shall I fetch her? I've already seen
her.

659
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,160
Now I'm on my way to York to visit
Bates,

660
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:25,925
and learn what he has to say about
it.

661
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,400
Then thank you so much for coming
all this way.

662
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Lady Mary, please tell your parents
how very sorry I am.

663
00:42:33,035 --> 00:42:34,960
Of course.

664
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,360
Mr Murray is just leaving.

665
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm sorry, darling. Forgive me. I
wasn't thinking.

666
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:58,097
It's just Murray was in the house...

667
00:42:58,132 --> 00:43:00,160
Papa has lost his youngest daughter.

668
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:02,205
I think that's enough.

669
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,440
Or does he have to lose control of
his estate on the same day?

670
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,760
And the challenge is
to get a statement from

671
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,400
Mrs Bartlett before she
realises its significance.

672
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,360
That's it.

673
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,200
I can't stop thinking about Lady
Sybil.

674
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,680
A lovely young woman at the height
of her happiness.

675
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,040
If I had any beliefs, that would
shake them.

676
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:35,000
Make your way out now.

677
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,040
I'll keep you informed, Mr Bates.

678
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
I'll do my very best for you.

679
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:42,760
Thank you, Mr Murray.

680
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,720
I suppose that's his lawyer.

681
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,085
Lord Grantham's lawyer, more like.

682
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,060
I don't care if he's lawyer to the
Prince of Wales.

683
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:57,000
He'll get a shock when he contacts
Mrs Audrey Bartlett.

684
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,800
Oh, Carson. Good afternoon, my Lady.

685
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,000
We've seen some troubles, you and I.

686
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,120
Nothing worse than this. Nothing
COULD be worse than this, my Lady.

687
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,080
(SHE GASPS)

688
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,965
Mama.

689
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,960
Oh, my dears.

690
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:04,040
You'll be glad to know they've found
a nurse for the baby.

691
00:45:04,075 --> 00:45:06,800
She is already here. Good, good.

692
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,165
Where's Tom?

693
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,880
He's upstairs. I've asked if he wants
anything.

694
00:45:13,915 --> 00:45:15,840
He says no.

695
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,560
He wants his wife back, but that's
what he can't have.

696
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,680
I must write to Dr Clarkson and have
it sent down before dinner.

697
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,640
Darling, there's no need for that.
I should. I want to.

698
00:45:31,675 --> 00:45:33,760
I have to apologise for our
behaviour.

699
00:45:33,795 --> 00:45:35,400
MARY: What?

700
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:36,525
Why?

701
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,940
Because if we'd listened to him,
Sybil might still be alive.

702
00:45:39,975 --> 00:45:43,320
But Sir Philip and your father knew
better, and now she's dead.

703
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,720
Why... Why did she say that?

704
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,640
Because there is some truth in it.

705
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,000
My dear, when tragedies strike,

706
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:01,565
we try to find someone to blame.

707
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,920
In the absence of a suitable
candidate, we usually blame ourselves.

708
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,400
You are not to blame. No-one is to
blame.

709
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,920
Our darling Sybil has died during
childbirth,

710
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,560
like too many women before her,

711
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:23,520
and all we can do now...

712
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,360
..is cherish her memory,

713
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,800
and her child.

714
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,200
Nevertheless, there is truth in it.

715
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,320
I thought I might move back in here
tonight.

716
00:46:51,355 --> 00:46:53,525
I think I'd rather sleep alone for a
while.

717
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,240
We should think about the
christening. She'll be Catholic.

718
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,525
She's Irish, and will be Catholic
like her father.

719
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,680
What were you doing at Crawley House
this morning? Who says I was there?

720
00:47:01,715 --> 00:47:04,485
I saw you coming out. Oh, I see.

721
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,480
You look very nice this morning.
Don't flirt with me, Robert, not now.

722
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:10,205
What do we do next?

723
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,320
ANNA: You mustn't do anything
stupid.

724
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,045
Promise me.

725
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,840
You won't win over the Christening.
Not if you're against me.

726
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,080
I'm never against you, but you've
lost on this one.

2
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,206
Is there any news of Sybil?

3
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,446
She's still not coming.
She insists they can't afford it.

4
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,447
Mr Travis, can we move forward?

5
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,807
If I could just ask you to
come down the aisle again?

6
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:57,087
Can we get the troops organised?

7
00:00:57,167 --> 00:00:59,167
That means me.

8
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:03,086
It seems rather hard on poor old
Travis when he's doing all the work,

9
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:04,926
but the Archbishop gets the glory.

10
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:07,327
Papa was the one who wanted
a prince of the church.

11
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,086
I'd have settled for Travis.

12
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,326
Is there really no way we can get
Sybil over? It seems ridiculous.

13
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:14,486
On the contrary, it's a relief.

14
00:01:14,487 --> 00:01:18,006
Branson is still an object
of fascination for the county.

15
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:22,367
We'll ask him here
when we can prepare the servants
and manage it gently.

16
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,766
He's making a problem
where none exists.

17
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:27,927
No-one could care less whether
Branson's at the wedding or not.

18
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,686
You must think country life
more exciting than it is

19
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:34,846
if you imagine people don't care
when an earl's daughter runs off
with the chauffeur.

20
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:38,606
She has run off with the chauffeur
and they'll have to get used to it.

21
00:01:38,607 --> 00:01:42,647
Mr Travis, are we ready?
Any moment, Your Grace. Any moment.

22
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:46,087
Can we... Please.

23
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,886
That treacle tart just hit the spot.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

24
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:05,726
So, Mrs Hughes and Anna
are getting the place ready to let?

25
00:02:05,727 --> 00:02:07,566
That is the plan.

26
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,847
I'm surprised Anna held on
to that house.

27
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:12,966
I thought they'd confiscated
the profits of murder.

28
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:16,126
Mr Bates had the wisdom to transfer
it to her before the trial.

29
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,086
I don't think I'd have allowed it.

30
00:02:18,087 --> 00:02:20,887
Then we must be grateful
you were not the presiding judge.

31
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:25,406
I still think it's funny, given
that he's a convicted murderer.

32
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:29,166
May I remind you, Mr Barrow, that in
this house Mr Bates is a wronged man

33
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:32,726
seeking justice. If you have
any problems with that definition,

34
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,727
I suggest you eat in the yard.

35
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:46,207
I suppose you agree with Robert.
Not for the first time,
you suppose wrongly.

36
00:02:47,727 --> 00:02:51,366
The family must never
be a topic of conversation.

37
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:54,646
I'm afraid Sybil's already made
the Crawleys a permanent topic.

38
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:56,686
All the more reason.

39
00:02:56,687 --> 00:02:59,005
If we can show the county
he can behave normally,

40
00:02:59,006 --> 00:03:00,887
they will soon lose interest in him.

41
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,486
And I shall make sure
he behaves normally

42
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:06,727
because I shall hold his hand
on the radiator until he does.

43
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:10,726
I don't know this young man
aside from 'Good morning'
and 'Good night',

44
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:14,326
but he strikes me as a very
interesting addition to the family.

45
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,526
Oh, here we go. And why should
he be normal as you call it?

46
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:21,686
I say he should come here
and fight his corner.

47
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:23,807
I like a man of strong beliefs.

48
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:26,806
I think I'll send them the money.

49
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,527
Please don't. Robert's expressly
forbidden it. He'd be furious.

50
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:34,727
But it can't be as bad as...

51
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:38,807
Look, I'll come and see you,
tomorrow.

52
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:41,247
No, I insist.

53
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,567
Right. Goodbye.

54
00:03:46,127 --> 00:03:48,007
Papa... What's the matter?

55
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,527
Nothing's the matter.
What should be the matter?

56
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,646
How was London?
We got it all done.

57
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,926
But I couldn't have managed
without my helper. Have you eaten?

58
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,686
We had a bite on the train.

59
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,767
Well, sit down anyway.
Have a cup of tea.

60
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:13,326
I'll start on the final list
for the wedding tomorrow morning.

61
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,686
I've got the last of the wine
deliveries coming on Tuesday.

62
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:19,806
How will you manage
without a footman? I agree.

63
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:21,767
But I haven't time to find one now.

64
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:25,766
I've had a letter from my sister
asking after a job for her son and...

65
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:29,246
Miss O'Brien, we are about to host
a society wedding.

66
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:32,167
I have no time for training
young hobbledehoys.

67
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,167
Her ladyship is ringing.

68
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,526
Well, I don't see why not.

69
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:48,406
I'll ask his lordship when...
There you are.

70
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:50,806
So I'll ask you now.
Ask me what?

71
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:54,046
Carson's in need of a footman
and O'Brien has a candidate.

72
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,886
Alfred. Alfred Nugent, my lord.
He's a good worker.

73
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:58,887
I think it sounds perfect.

74
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:04,006
Robert? Whatever you say. My dear,
I have to go up to London tomorrow.

75
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:06,846
I'll be catching the early train.
That's very sudden.

76
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,926
Do you want them to open the house?
No, I'll come straight back.

77
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,967
What are you going for?
It's nothing to bother you with.

78
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,967
It's all there, every entry.

79
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,046
Where did you find the book?
Behind the bureau.

80
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,247
We moved it out to clean
and there it was.

81
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,366
Vera must have dropped it
or something.

82
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,246
So what do you want me to do?

83
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:44,247
Make notes on all the names.

84
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,807
Close friend, relation.

85
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,047
Workmate, tradesman, and so on.

86
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:52,927
Then I'll copy those and I'll send
them with the book to Mr Murray.

87
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,847
Haven't you anything better to do?
I have not.

88
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:02,327
Because I'd rather work to get you
free than dine with the King
at Buckingham Palace.

89
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,647
So what news have you got?

90
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,367
What news could I have in here?

91
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,246
Oh, I've acquired a new cellmate.

92
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,247
To be honest,
I'm not sure about him.

93
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:20,047
Well, just remember
what my mother used to say.

94
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:22,567
Never make an enemy by accident.

95
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:27,927
Now, do you think you can get the
notes done before my next visit?

96
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,967
I don't see what can come of it.

97
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,366
Probably nothing.

98
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,766
And my next idea will probably lead
to nothing.

99
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,767
And the next, and the next.

100
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:40,647
But one day something will occur
to us.

101
00:06:41,007 --> 00:06:42,886
And we'll follow it up.

102
00:06:42,887 --> 00:06:45,007
And the case against you
will crumble.

103
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,446
Do you never doubt?

104
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:50,447
For just one minute.

105
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:55,127
I wouldn't blame you.
No.

106
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:58,807
I don't doubt that the sun will rise
in the east either.

107
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:05,247
You're too tall to be a footman.

108
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,606
No footman
should be over six foot one.

109
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,807
That can't be, can it,
since he's already been taken on?

110
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:16,766
Well, what have you done?
I was a hotel waiter after I was
discharged from the army.

111
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:21,207
But they've cut back.
I think that shows real initiative.

112
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,046
I suppose he can speak for himself.

113
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:26,047
Why? Is he on trial?

114
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:30,246
This isn't an interview, is it?
Not when he's already got the job.

115
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,526
No, it is not an interview,
Miss O'Brien,

116
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:35,726
but he is on trial
and if he cannot match our standards,

117
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:38,606
he will be found guilty.
I mean to try, Mr Carson.

118
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:40,606
As long as you do.

119
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,727
Right, go upstairs
and get settled in.

120
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:46,407
Your aunt will hopefully
find you a livery that fits.

121
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:56,326
Just at the start, so we've a place
to sleep after the honeymoon.

122
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:58,206
You can't object to that.

123
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,047
No, it's nice of them.

124
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,166
Though I doubt
I'll get used to taking you to bed
with your father watching.

125
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:08,326
He's so relieved we're getting
married, he wouldn't mind
if you carried me up naked.

126
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,327
Careful. I might try it.

127
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,046
I don't want to move to London
or anything.

128
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:17,446
I'm not kicking against the traces.

129
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:19,246
Just testing their strengths.

130
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:21,247
I want us to get to know each other.

131
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:25,767
To learn about who we both are,
without everybody being there.

132
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,566
Well, it's quite a big house.

133
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:30,606
It's a lovely house.

134
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,007
It's your home
and I want it to be my home too.

135
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,567
Just not quite yet.

136
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:48,527
Chancery Lane.
Yes, sir.

137
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:55,366
I've spoken to Frobisher and Curran

138
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:59,126
and, since I am a trustee,
should the estate ever need one,

139
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,247
we felt I ought to be the one
to tell you.

140
00:09:01,887 --> 00:09:03,766
You make it sound very serious.

141
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:07,407
I'm expressing myself badly
if you think it is not serious.

142
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:12,326
Why did we invest so much?

143
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:15,246
Lord Grantham,
it was you who insisted we should.

144
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,406
If you remember,
we advised against it.

145
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:20,726
But war would mean a huge expansion
of railways everywhere.

146
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,646
Every forecast was certain.

147
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,206
Rail shares were bound
to make a fortune.

148
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:28,726
Many did.
But your principal holding,
which was very large indeed,

149
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,406
was in
the Canadian Grand Trunk Line.

150
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,286
It was the main railway in British
North America, for God's sake.

151
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:38,407
It wasn't just me.
Everyone said we couldn't lose.

152
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:42,246
We knew hard times were coming
for estates like Downton

153
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,286
and this investment would make it
safe for the rest of time.

154
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:47,446
Charles Hays
was the presiding genius

155
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:49,887
and since he died,
the management has not...

156
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:54,687
The fact is, the company
is about to be declared bankrupt.

157
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:59,127
And the line will be absorbed
into the Canadian National Railways
scheme.

158
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:05,887
Are you really telling me
that all the money has gone?

159
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:10,567
I'm afraid so.
The lion's share of Cora's fortune?

160
00:10:20,407 --> 00:10:22,407
I won't give in, Murray.

161
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:26,167
I've sacrificed too much to Downton
to give in now.

162
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,846
I refuse to be the failure,

163
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,166
the earl who dropped the torch
and let the flame go out.

164
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:36,407
I hate to state the obvious,
but if there's not enough money
to run it...

165
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:38,886
Downton must go.

166
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:41,966
Unless you break it up
and sell it off piecemeal.

167
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:46,327
I couldn't do that. I have a duty
beyond saving my own skin.

168
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:50,606
The estate must be a major employer
and support the house

169
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,967
or there's no point to it.
To any of it.

170
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:00,765
Morning.

171
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,205
Lady Edith...

172
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:14,285
Hello.

173
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:18,102
What are you doing here? I'm meeting
a train, but I'm too early. Oh.

174
00:11:18,103 --> 00:11:21,023
Oh. I mustn't hold you up.
I'm not doing anything.

175
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:23,783
I thought I'd get away
from wedding panic.

176
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,823
Don't you like weddings?
Don't be silly. Of course I do.

177
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:31,542
Only I've talked of clothes
and flowers and food and guests

178
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:33,543
until I'm blue in the face.

179
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:37,503
Yes, weddings can be reminders
of one's loneliness, can't they?

180
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:39,943
Sorry. I don't know why I said that.

181
00:11:39,944 --> 00:11:41,742
So, how's it going?

182
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:45,063
Is your grandmother coming over
from New York for it? She is.

183
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:47,382
And Sybil... Is she here yet?

184
00:11:47,383 --> 00:11:50,742
As a matter of fact, she wasn't
coming. But I think she is now.

185
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,582
Mary had a letter this morning.

186
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:55,582
Papa doesn't know yet.
He will be pleased.

187
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,623
I do hope so.

188
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:02,582
So you'll live at the big house
when you're back from honeymoon?

189
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,583
Not live. Stay.

190
00:12:04,983 --> 00:12:07,463
We'll stay there until we decide
where to go.

191
00:12:07,823 --> 00:12:10,742
It'll be on the estate,
I should think, or in the village.

192
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:12,743
Not here?
No.

193
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:16,623
But I shall expect you and Mrs Bird
to look after Mrs Crawley.

194
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:22,463
You'll not be taking me with you,
sir?

195
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:27,063
Only I thought you'd be needing
a proper valet, once you're married.

196
00:12:28,023 --> 00:12:31,702
I've always thought of you as
a butler who helps out as a valet...

197
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:34,622
not the other way round.
I'd be happy to be a valet, sir.

198
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:38,023
Especially in the big house. We
won't be at the big house for long.

199
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:42,463
To be honest, Molesley, I want to
live more simply after the wedding.

200
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:47,223
And besides,
Mother absolutely relies on you.

201
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,663
Well, that's very nice to hear, sir.
Thank you.

202
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,582
You must be exhausted, my lord.

203
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,222
You can't have spent
more than two hours in London.

204
00:12:57,223 --> 00:13:01,143
It was sufficient. The new footman
arrived while you were gone.

205
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,662
What?

206
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Yes, he got the cable this morning
and came straight over.

207
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:09,902
Very eager.

208
00:13:09,903 --> 00:13:11,822
And very tall.

209
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:13,823
But when did...

210
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,143
Never mind.

211
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,222
Did you know about the new footman?

212
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:22,223
Of course. He's already here.

213
00:13:22,383 --> 00:13:25,542
Why did no-one tell me?
What do you mean?

214
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,823
We talked about it last night.
In my room.

215
00:13:28,023 --> 00:13:31,502
Well, nobody else must be taken on.
Absolutely no-one.

216
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:33,503
Until things are settled.

217
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:35,703
What things?

218
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:39,222
How's the wedding going?
I suppose it's costing the earth?

219
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:41,542
Mary was never going to marry
on the cheap.

220
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:44,383
Oh, no.
Nothing must be done on the cheap.

221
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:49,102
I feel quite nervous.
Don't be.

222
00:13:49,103 --> 00:13:51,662
You've got the skill
and you've got the willingness.

223
00:13:51,663 --> 00:13:53,902
But he hasn't got the experience.
He's right.

224
00:13:53,903 --> 00:13:58,502
Pay no attention. You've a nice
manner. You're not vain like Thomas.

225
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:00,503
They'll like that.

226
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:05,263
What's the matter with you?
I'm fed up.

227
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:08,862
They promised me promotion. She said
they'd get a new kitchen maid

228
00:14:08,863 --> 00:14:10,663
and I'd be Mrs Patmore's assistant.

229
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,422
If they promised,
you should withdraw your services.

230
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,382
What do you mean? Like go on strike?

231
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:18,383
But don't say I put you up to it.

232
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:25,422
But what was in the letter?
Just that Sybil's coming after all.

233
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:27,542
She'll be here on Wednesday
for dinner.

234
00:14:27,543 --> 00:14:31,063
Will she be coming alone?
Don't make trouble, Mother.

235
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:35,503
Can I do it?
If you wish, my lady. Of course.

236
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:40,383
Are you really that tall?
Yes, my lady.

237
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:43,623
I thought you might have been
walking on stilts.

238
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:46,822
When does Grandmama arrive?

239
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:50,382
She gets into Liverpool on the 15th
- the day before the wedding

240
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:53,022
I'm so looking forward
to seeing your mother again.

241
00:14:53,023 --> 00:14:56,823
When I'm with her I'm reminded
of the virtues of the English.

242
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:59,943
But isn't she American?
Exactly.

243
00:15:00,663 --> 00:15:02,542
Can I help myself?

244
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:04,462
You want to as well, my lord?

245
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:07,863
To be honest, I think you'll find
that we all do it as well.

246
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,983
What do you think you're doing?
You're not in a hotel now.

247
00:15:14,503 --> 00:15:16,502
Did you train in a hotel?

248
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:18,503
I did, ma'am.

249
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,063
That will be useful.
Won't it, Carson?

250
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,822
Are you all set for the wedding?

251
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,103
Of course he is.
Carson's motto is, 'Be prepared.'

252
00:15:28,343 --> 00:15:30,863
I'm afraid Baden-Powell
has stolen it.

253
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:33,183
But you have all the help you need?

254
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:36,983
Well, I wouldn't fight the idea
of a second footman, my lady.

255
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:42,862
I sometimes think it's time we lived
in a simpler way.

256
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,222
I agree. Much cattle, much care.

257
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,302
Always supposing we have the choice.

258
00:15:47,303 --> 00:15:50,863
Oh, don't say that.
It's our job to provide employment.

259
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:53,422
An aristocrat with no servants

260
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:56,183
is as much use to the county
as a glass hammer!

261
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:02,662
I knew this would happen. Typical.
What's typical?

262
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,582
That I'd wind up looking after
Mr Matthew. That's all I need.

263
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,143
He hasn't thought it through.
I'm sorry to say, but he hasn't.

264
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:12,662
Are you worried for your job,
Mr Molesley?

265
00:16:12,663 --> 00:16:14,422
Me? Oh, heavens, no.

266
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:17,822
No, no, no, I'm essential
to Mrs Crawley. She relies on me.

267
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:20,582
That's what he said.
Essential.

268
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,863
Oh, yes, we're all essential.
Until we get sacked.

269
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:28,862
How was it?
Alfred was confused.

270
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,143
He thought he'd been transported
to the Hotel Metropole.

271
00:16:32,943 --> 00:16:35,142
Cheer up. You'll get the hang of it.

272
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:39,862
Will I?
Oh, you're still here, Mr Molesley.

273
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:42,982
I know. I only walked over
for a cup of tea and a chat.

274
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:45,302
But I've outstayed my welcome.
Nonsense.

275
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:47,262
Why not have a bite with us?

276
00:16:47,263 --> 00:16:49,862
They won't be leaving
for a half hour or more.

277
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:52,582
No, I'd better get back.
I wouldn't want them to get home

278
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:55,423
and me not be there to let them in.
No, you wouldn't.

279
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,023
Not when you're essential.

280
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:01,383
Then why is he coming all the way
here?

281
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:04,462
Why not say it on the telephone?
I have no idea.

282
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,142
If Mr Swire's lawyer
wants to see you and it's urgent,

283
00:17:07,143 --> 00:17:09,382
it means he's left you something.
I doubt it.

284
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:11,263
I would have heard long before this.

285
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,222
Anyway, I hope not.
Why?

286
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,422
Matthew. Do come on.

287
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:18,743
The chauffeur's freezing to death
and so am I.

288
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:23,382
Are you looking forward
to the wedding?

289
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:25,383
What do you think?

290
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:28,143
I'm looking forward
to all sorts of things.

291
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:31,143
Don't make me blush.
Matthew!

292
00:18:02,503 --> 00:18:04,503
Dearest Papa.

293
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:08,943
Tell me, did you send the money?

294
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:12,062
Please say yes.
What money?

295
00:18:12,063 --> 00:18:14,063
Hello, Tom.

296
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,143
Welcome to Downton.

297
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,983
I hope I am welcome, your ladyship.
Of course.

298
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:23,863
Alfred, would you take the luggage
for Mr Branson?

299
00:18:24,783 --> 00:18:26,583
There's tea in the library.

300
00:18:27,503 --> 00:18:29,503
Thank you.

301
00:18:38,023 --> 00:18:40,023
Hello, Mr Carson.

302
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:51,702
Is that Mr Charkham I saw leaving?
Yes.

303
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:54,902
He said to make his apologies.
He was late for his train.

304
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,903
What did he have to say for himself?

305
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,903
I don't know where to start.

306
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:05,263
Basically, it seems that Reggie Swire
did not wish to divide his fortune.

307
00:19:06,183 --> 00:19:09,942
So when Lavinia died, he made a new
will with a list of three heirs,

308
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:12,263
of which I was the third.

309
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:15,742
Why didn't the first name succeed?

310
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,743
He died before Reggie.

311
00:19:17,943 --> 00:19:20,463
In the same epidemic
that killed Lavinia.

312
00:19:20,903 --> 00:19:25,182
But at first they thought that the
second heir, a Mr Clive Pullbrook,

313
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:27,183
would be easy to trace.

314
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,463
How much money are we talking about?

315
00:19:30,223 --> 00:19:32,223
A lot.

316
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:34,503
A huge amount. I had no idea.

317
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,582
You could never have told it
from Reggie's way of life.

318
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,583
Lucky Mr Pullbrook.

319
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,143
This is it.

320
00:19:42,543 --> 00:19:45,062
Some time before Reggie's death,

321
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:47,022
Pullbrook travelled to the East,

322
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,863
to India, to some tea plantations
he owned there.

323
00:19:51,543 --> 00:19:54,702
And?
He's never been heard of since.

324
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:58,743
They've made enquiries. They've sent
an agent out to visit his property.

325
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:01,183
There's no sign of him.

326
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,343
I'm sorry. I won't. And that's flat.

327
00:20:05,783 --> 00:20:07,782
Then you'll have to do it,
Mr Carson.

328
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,902
I'm not dressing a chauffeur.

329
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:11,862
He is not a chauffeur now.

330
00:20:11,863 --> 00:20:13,823
Anyway, you don't have to dress him,

331
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:16,102
just see he's got everything
he needs.

332
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:20,302
I'm not often as one with Mr Barrow,
but no.

333
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,742
Then Alfred must do it.
Alfred?

334
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:26,182
He wouldn't know what to do
beyond collecting dirty shoes.

335
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,183
Well, he'll have to learn.

336
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,489
Is it an Irish tradition?

337
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:37,396
What?
She means not changing.

338
00:20:37,492 --> 00:20:40,411
Of course it isn't, Granny.
It might have been.

339
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:43,251
You don't change on the first night
of a voyage.

340
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:45,611
No, my lady,
I don't own a set of tails

341
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:48,931
or a dinner jacket either.
I wouldn't get any use out of them.

342
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:52,691
Well, I hope you own a morning coat
since you're here for a wedding.

343
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:56,811
No, I'm afraid I don't. We live
a different kind of life, Papa.

344
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:59,082
Obviously.

345
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:01,722
Could you lower it a bit, please,
Mr Carson?

346
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,361
You should buy a Downton wardrobe
and leave it here.

347
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:09,361
Then you won't have to pack
when you come. What a good idea.

348
00:21:09,362 --> 00:21:12,721
I'm afraid I can't turn into
somebody else just to please you.

349
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:16,641
More's the pity. Oh, no,
why should you change to please us?

350
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:18,761
What is the general feeling
in Ireland now?

351
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:23,321
That we're in sight of throwing off
the English yoke.
Do you approve of the new act?

352
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:26,281
Would you of your country
being divided by a foreign power?

353
00:21:26,282 --> 00:21:29,321
Well, won't it bring home rule
for Southern Ireland nearer?

354
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,241
Home rule on English terms
presided over by an English king.

355
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:34,081
Is keeping the monarchy a problem?

356
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:37,402
Would it be a problem for you
to be ruled by the German Kaiser?

357
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:41,801
Carson, are you all right?

358
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,681
I've been very clumsy, my lord.
I do apologise.

359
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:49,281
Is it true that Irish gardens
have more variety than ours?

360
00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:53,561
Oh, yes. Don't you remember
Lady Dufferin's ball at Claneboye?

361
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,522
The gardens there were heavenly.

362
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,521
I thought them very down on him.
That is because you know nothing.

363
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:03,441
And wasn't he down on them,

364
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:06,321
insulting our country,
insulting the King?

365
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:09,161
I thought it was a miracle
his lordship held his temper.

366
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,521
But it must be hard, Mr Carson.

367
00:22:11,522 --> 00:22:15,402
To sit up there
with people he used to drive around.

368
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:18,242
It is hard, Mrs Hughes.

369
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:21,601
Please, sit down.

370
00:22:21,602 --> 00:22:23,602
Is there something we can do, sir?

371
00:22:25,002 --> 00:22:27,161
I just wanted to come down
to say hello.

372
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:31,762
I wouldn't want you to think I'd got
too big for my boots. That's nice.

373
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,721
I hope you and Lady Sybil are well?

374
00:22:34,722 --> 00:22:36,721
We are. Thank you.

375
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,121
And we've been following
the story of Mr Bates.

376
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:40,882
Mary keeps us informed.

377
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:46,002
Still, I mustn't interrupt
your dinner.

378
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:48,402
Thank you for coming down.

379
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,081
He's settled into his new life.

380
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:58,361
'Mary keeps us informed.'

381
00:22:58,362 --> 00:23:01,841
Well, he knows her now.
What's that got to do with it?

382
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:05,522
His lordship would never call her
Mary when talking to me. Never.

383
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:10,242
If he wants to play their game,
he'd better learn their rules.

384
00:23:11,882 --> 00:23:15,001
Tomorrow let's ask the servants
to come up and dine with us

385
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,961
to make things easier.

386
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:20,601
You must get him to stop calling
Granny 'my lady'. And Mama.

387
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:24,401
We need something that doesn't sound
too stiff and grand.

388
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,402
Lady Grantham, of course.

389
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:28,882
And he can call me Lord Grantham.

390
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:32,562
That doesn't sound stiff or grand
at all.

391
00:23:32,922 --> 00:23:34,922
One step at a time.

392
00:23:39,682 --> 00:23:42,601
So what did the lawyer want?
I presume he turned up.

393
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:45,322
He did, and it's rather complicated.

394
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,482
But you were right.
It was about Reggie's will.

395
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,681
So he's left you something?

396
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:53,961
Never mind that now. Sit down
and tell me about the relations

397
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:57,762
that are coming for the wedding.
I want to unscramble them in my head.

398
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:01,762
Go to bed when you're done.
I'll go to bed when I'm ready.

399
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:06,401
What's happened to you? Have you
swapped places with your evil twin?

400
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:09,841
I'd like to know where the new maid
is. That's what you promised.

401
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:11,841
They've got a footman.
Where's the maid?

402
00:24:11,842 --> 00:24:15,001
I know and I'm sorry,
but I spoke to Mr Carson tonight

403
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,281
and they won't be taking
anyone new on.

404
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:21,281
Except a footman. I don't know
how Mr Carson managed it

405
00:24:21,282 --> 00:24:23,521
because his lordship's
put his foot down.

406
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:27,641
But you're called my assistant now
and you've seven shillings extra
every month.

407
00:24:27,642 --> 00:24:30,721
You've still kept me here
with a dishonest representation.

408
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:33,682
Oh, dear!
Have you swallowed a dictionary?

409
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:40,042
Somehow none of it seems to matter
when we're in Dublin.

410
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:42,802
Class and all that
just seems to fade away.

411
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:47,602
I'm Mrs Branson and we get on with
our lives like millions of others.

412
00:24:48,282 --> 00:24:50,282
But here he feels so patronised.

413
00:24:51,042 --> 00:24:54,441
And he hates it.
But you don't regret it?

414
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,442
No, never.

415
00:24:57,282 --> 00:24:59,282
He's a wonderful, wonderful man.

416
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:01,681
I just wish you knew him.

417
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:03,561
Darling, we will know him.

418
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:05,762
We'll know him and value him.
I promise.

419
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,482
Anyway...

420
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:14,122
I'd best go upstairs
and make sure he's not too suicidal.

421
00:25:14,482 --> 00:25:16,482
Good night.

422
00:25:16,762 --> 00:25:19,561
Oh, by the way,
I don't know if Mama's told you...

423
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,482
But the whole Grey family's
coming tomorrow night.

424
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:25,722
Including Larry?

425
00:25:26,362 --> 00:25:28,362
Crikey.
You'd better warn Tom.

426
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:33,562
Oh, and, Sybil, I wouldn't tell Papa
about being Mrs Branson.

427
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,001
But who are the Greys?

428
00:25:41,002 --> 00:25:43,161
And why does it matter
that they're coming?

429
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:45,521
The father, Lord Merton,
is Mary's godfather.

430
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:48,841
But Larry Grey used to be keen on me,
when we were young.

431
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:50,881
Were you keen on him?

432
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,882
No. I don't think so.

433
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,682
I can hardly remember, to be honest.

434
00:25:55,962 --> 00:25:59,962
So what are you saying?
Nothing particularly.

435
00:26:00,682 --> 00:26:03,761
But we could run into Ripon
and find some tails.

436
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,761
We have the money.

437
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:07,762
I won't spend more of that money.

438
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:10,882
All right.

439
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:14,242
Please don't talk about Ireland
all the time.

440
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:16,962
I just want to make things easier
for you.

441
00:26:18,562 --> 00:26:20,562
For me or for you?

442
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,922
Don't disappoint me, Sybil.

443
00:26:23,242 --> 00:26:25,242
Not now that we're here.

444
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,521
Shall I order the car?

445
00:26:36,522 --> 00:26:38,641
I don't think
I can refuse a lift with Mother

446
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:40,921
and then make the poor man
go out again.

447
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:42,922
I'll walk.
It might rain.

448
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,362
Then I'll get wet.

449
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,682
Now come and kiss me.

450
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,761
So, if they can't find Mr... Pillbox,
what will you do with the money?

451
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:59,522
Pullbrook. And they will find him.

452
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:02,522
But if they don't?

453
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:05,362
Then I'll decide what to do.

454
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,082
Or we will.

455
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:14,842
Because I can't keep it.
No, of course not.

456
00:27:18,362 --> 00:27:22,282
Why have you so heavily invested in
one enterprise? Wasn't it foolish?

457
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,522
Has some of my fortune been lost?

458
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:29,002
Some.

459
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:32,441
All.

460
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,442
Almost all.

461
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:44,162
Oh, my dear.

462
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:51,882
How terrible for you.

463
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:54,841
It's not so good for you.

464
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:58,322
Don't worry about me. I'm an
American. Have gun, will travel.

465
00:28:00,682 --> 00:28:03,042
Thank god for you, anyway.

466
00:28:07,162 --> 00:28:09,162
You know what?

467
00:28:09,842 --> 00:28:12,042
I'm glad we have a wedding
to celebrate.

468
00:28:13,842 --> 00:28:15,842
Let's make sure it's a great day.

469
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:22,322
If it's to be our last,
let's make it a wonderful last.

470
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:28,322
Enjoy our lovely home and the lovely
people we spend our life among.

471
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:44,241
Bit early for drowning your sorrows.

472
00:28:44,242 --> 00:28:47,162
I thought it might be better
if I moved down to the pub.

473
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:51,841
You're not serious?
I can't go through many more dinners
like last night.

474
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,842
You don't make it easy for them.

475
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:57,722
Do you really think you can recruit
cousin Robert for Sinn Fein?

476
00:28:57,842 --> 00:28:59,881
I don't know what gets into me.

477
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:02,761
I can see them staring
and I know they don't want me here.

478
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:04,601
Well, don't include me. Or Mary.

479
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:08,201
She wasn't too keen on the idea of a
chauffeur for a brother-in-law.

480
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:10,322
Forget that. She's a pragmatist.

481
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:13,921
She could be a tough fighter, too.
Let's hope she's not tested.

482
00:29:13,922 --> 00:29:18,201
Forget this and walk back.
We're brothers-in-law
with high-minded wives.

483
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:20,202
We'd better stick together.

484
00:29:27,242 --> 00:29:29,281
It's all there.

485
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:32,001
Friends
- though there weren't too many...

486
00:29:32,002 --> 00:29:34,081
tradesmen, acquaintances.

487
00:29:34,082 --> 00:29:36,601
But I can't see
what you'll get out of them.

488
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:39,281
I do not believe,
when Vera decided to kill herself,

489
00:29:39,282 --> 00:29:41,841
she never mentioned it
to another living soul.

490
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,601
We know she left no note.

491
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:45,602
I wish to god she had.

492
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:49,281
But why are you sure it was suicide
and not murder?

493
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:51,441
Well, I know you didn't kill her.

494
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:53,681
What's the alternative?

495
00:29:53,682 --> 00:29:57,442
A thief broke in, cooked an arsenic
pie and forced her to eat it?

496
00:29:57,842 --> 00:30:00,122
It's not a very likely scenario.

497
00:30:01,202 --> 00:30:03,202
You can see why they convicted me.

498
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:05,961
I'm going to write to everyone
in the book,

499
00:30:05,962 --> 00:30:09,321
in case she said,
or, please god, wrote anything

500
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:11,322
that could suggest a desire to die.

501
00:30:12,002 --> 00:30:14,441
How long will that take?

502
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:17,802
Why? Are you going somewhere?

503
00:30:20,482 --> 00:30:24,361
I should have gone into cooking.
I could pick it up in a trice.

504
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:27,282
Why didn't you, then?
It's a hard ladder for a man.

505
00:30:27,762 --> 00:30:31,401
For every Escoffier and Monsieur
Careme there's a thousand dogsbodies

506
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:34,121
taking orders from a cross,
red-faced old woman.

507
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:35,881
Who's this you're discussing?

508
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:38,881
Hello, Mrs Patmore.
I didn't see you standing there.

509
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:40,882
Obviously not.

510
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:45,361
Sarah thought
I'd be better off as a butler
and that's what I'm trying for.

511
00:30:45,362 --> 00:30:48,121
I think you're right.
I'd rather be giving the orders.

512
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:51,802
To a cross and red-faced old woman.
Yes, we know.

513
00:30:56,202 --> 00:30:58,681
There. Is that what you meant?

514
00:30:58,682 --> 00:31:00,682
Yes. Perfect.

515
00:31:01,402 --> 00:31:03,402
Slightly new, but not too different.

516
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,162
We'll see if Sir Anthony notices.

517
00:31:10,282 --> 00:31:13,402
I know they all think he's too old
for me, but he's not.

518
00:31:13,602 --> 00:31:16,482
Bates is older than you
and you're as happy as lovebirds.

519
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,242
Our situation is hardly ideal,

520
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:23,082
but, yes, we're very happy together.

521
00:31:23,922 --> 00:31:25,922
Which is all that matters.

522
00:31:26,442 --> 00:31:28,442
As I keep telling them.

523
00:31:33,362 --> 00:31:36,922
I've no time to talk.
His lordship's not come up yet.

524
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,362
Well? What is it?

525
00:31:40,162 --> 00:31:44,042
I was hoping you could help
young Alfred to find his way about.

526
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:47,882
As a footman, you mean.
As a valet.

527
00:31:49,162 --> 00:31:51,201
He's looking after Mr Branson now.

528
00:31:51,202 --> 00:31:54,081
Though I daresay a chauffeur
can dress himself.

529
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:57,401
But you could tell him what he needs
to know, give him an advantage.

530
00:31:57,402 --> 00:31:59,241
Why? What's the rush?

531
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:02,162
You've heard Mr Matthew
has turned down Mr Molesley?

532
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:04,682
Blimey, you don't want much, do you?

533
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:08,641
Can you remember what I had
to go through to be a valet?

534
00:32:08,642 --> 00:32:11,041
Of course. I watched it, didn't I?

535
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:14,041
But young Alfred is to make
the great leap in one bound?

536
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:17,162
Well, I'm sorry, Miss O'Brien,
but I'm not convinced.

537
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:20,202
If you'll excuse me.

538
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,989
It's infuriating.
There's nothing he can do.

539
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,029
I don't agree. I think it's feeble.

540
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,029
He should will himself not to be ill
and then collapse the next day.

541
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,710
Whom will you ask instead?
I'm not sure.

542
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,949
I've known Sybil all my life.

543
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,749
You can imagine how curious I was
when I found out
you'd be here tonight.

544
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:04,109
Never thought we'd meet in person.

545
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,510
As opposed to what? In spirit?

546
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,829
Well, you see, to us,
in marrying you

547
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,870
it seemed like Sybil
had left Downton Abbey forever.

548
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,390
If you know what I mean.

549
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,070
I know exactly what you mean.

550
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:27,149
Did they lose your suitcase on the
way over? How maddening for you.

551
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,949
No, my suitcase arrived safely,
thank you.

552
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,950
Along with my manners.

553
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,310
He's still dressed as
the man from the Prudential, I see.

554
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:44,510
Yes, it's nice to have someone
from the real world, isn't it?

555
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,789
Hello, Mama. Can I tempt you
to one of these new cocktails?

556
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,749
I don't think so.

557
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,589
They look too exciting
for so early in the evening.

558
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,709
Don't you think so, Carson?

559
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,230
Better avoided, my lady.
I think so.

560
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:05,070
What a pleasure it is to see you
out and about, Sir Anthony.

561
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,469
I want to say,
'Can I be of any help?'
but you don't seem to need any.

562
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,989
He doesn't need help at all, do you?
He won't let me do anything.

563
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,790
Mustn't be a nuisance, you know.

564
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,990
Are you coming to the wedding?
Of course.

565
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,430
Well, if you really want me.

566
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,390
I do. I really do.

567
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,990
You look very nice. Have you done
something jolly with your hair?

568
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,149
I say. What the devil...

569
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,709
What is it?

570
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,710
Dinner is served, your ladyship.

571
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,229
How's it going?
Awkward.

572
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:45,869
Mr Branson's well away
and Lady Sybil doesn't like it much.

573
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,989
He's only had one cocktail.

574
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,390
Maybe he was drinking before
he came down to calm his nerves.

575
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,629
No, I don't agree,
and I don't care who knows it.

576
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,509
The Black and Tans are there
to restore order, are they?

577
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,909
Why don't they just murder
the entire population

578
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,109
and then you wouldn't hear a squeak
from them.

579
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,029
Is there any way to shut him up?
If I knew that,
he wouldn't be here at all.

580
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,549
Are you interested
in Irish politics, Lord Merton?

581
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,629
I was only just saying...
He's interested in Irish repression.

582
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,429
Like all of you. Look,
of course this stuff matters to you.

583
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,269
Yes, it does matter...

584
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,869
this stuff.
It matters a very great deal.

585
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,109
What's so funny?
Nothing.

586
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,310
I'm just enjoying this vivid display
of Irish character.

587
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:32,270
Please, Tom.
We don't need to wear everyone out.

588
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:38,190
Why? What's the matter?
Am I not being polite enough?

589
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,429
What a minute.
This was down to you, wasn't it?

590
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,789
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.

591
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,710
You put something in his drink,
didn't you? Just before we came in.

592
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,709
That's not true, is it, Larry?
What a beastly thing to do.

593
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,229
Oh, come on, Edith. That's not like
you. You could always take a joke.

594
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,229
A bully's defence.

595
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,749
Listen, Mr Grey has given Mr Branson
something to make him appear drunk.

596
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,989
Could it be drink?
No, not drink. Some horrible pill.

597
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,790
Sybil, take him upstairs.
Il ne manque que ca.

598
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,509
Tom has been the victim
of a cruel prank

599
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,469
which I know you'll all
be kind enough to forget.

600
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,069
Forgive, perhaps. Forget? Never.
Is this true, Larry?

601
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,189
I don't know why you're getting
so hot under the collar.

602
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,150
He's only a grubby little chauffeur.

603
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:25,110
Be silent this instant, sir!

604
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,670
I apologise for my son, Mr Branson.
Unreservedly.

605
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,350
I only hope
you'll recover before the wedding.

606
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,389
I hope so too.

607
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,790
Since I want him to be my best man.

608
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,069
Bravo. Well said.

609
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,189
Do you really mean it?
Honestly?

610
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,389
I've told you. If we're mad enough
to take on the Crawley girls,

611
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,390
we have to stick together.

612
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,070
Thank you, Matthew.
Thank you so much.

613
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:02,789
That was rather marvellous of you
to expose Larry Grey like that.

614
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,189
You saved the day. I wouldn't
say that. Matthew saved the day.

615
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,190
No, it was you.

616
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,869
I do hope we'll see a bit more of you
once the wedding's over.

617
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,949
Well...
Wouldn't you like that?

618
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,950
I should like that very much.

619
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,670
Much more than I probably ought to.

620
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,430
Edith, let Sir Anthony go.

621
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
Goodnight, Papa.

622
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,149
Well, that's the last of them.

623
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:45,469
Where are the others?
They've gone to bed.

624
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,470
So's Edith. And so should we.

625
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,710
Golly. What a night
for the county to feed off.

626
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:56,070
It was good of Matthew
to show solidarity.

627
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,550
I suppose so.

628
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:01,749
We're going to need
all the solidarity we can muster.

629
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,750
When will you tell the girls?

630
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:10,110
I think I should tell Mary now.
Not before the wedding, surely.

631
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,669
I must. They're disagreeing
about where they should live.

632
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,989
It would be wrong for me
to keep it from them.

633
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:19,270
They can discuss it on the honeymoon
and decide more sensibly.

634
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,429
Should we say something to your
mother when she gets here? No.

635
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,550
She'll go into state mourning
and cast a pall
over the whole proceedings.

636
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,709
Thank god she missed tonight's drama
or we'd never hear the end of it.

637
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,310
Don't worry. She'll bring
enough drama of her own.

638
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,990
Hm.

639
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,829
It won't work, you know.

640
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,349
If you don't admit your guilt,
they won't let you go.

641
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,510
How can I admit what isn't true?

642
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:55,710
Why do you have to be so pious?

643
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,070
You're a touchy fella, aren't you?

644
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,349
Don't push me, Craig.

645
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,350
Is that a warning?

646
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,350
Yes. Yes, it is.

647
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,430
I'm warning you.

648
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,869
I'm not sure about the hat.

649
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,029
Is it supposed to look crooked?

650
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,629
Don't listen to her. I love it.
You're not to change a thing.

651
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,430
Anna?
I think you look lovely, my lady.

652
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:36,869
Stop. Wait. Who is it?

653
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:40,150
Your long-suffering papa.
I suppose he can come in.

654
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,190
What's this for?
Going away.

655
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,110
How does it look?
Expensive.

656
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,789
Twice the national debt, I'm afraid.

657
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:53,070
But I know you don't mind.

658
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,029
Can I have one moment alone
to give Mary my blessing?

659
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,630
That's lovely. Shoo, everyone.

660
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,630
Go on, bless me.

661
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:13,910
Of course. But there's something
I feel I ought to tell you first.

662
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:18,510
I wanted to wait until you got back,
but I don't believe I can.

663
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,550
That sounds rather ominous.

664
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,389
Hello, Mr Molesley. I got
a message to call on Mrs Crawley.

665
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,710
Very good, sir. If you'd like
to give me your hat and coat, sir.

666
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:38,029
Are you going up to the house
to welcome the Queen of Sheba?

667
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,029
Oh, I think so.

668
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,069
Are you?
No.

669
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,029
I'll pay homage at dinner.

670
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,069
I've always admired the way
Mrs Levinson is never overawed

671
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,430
by the set-up at Downton. Was
Napoleon overawed by the Bourbons?

672
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,870
Come in, Tom.

673
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,990
May I call you Tom?
Of course.

674
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,790
Good afternoon, my lady.
That is, Lady Grantham.

675
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,150
I'm glad to find you here because...

676
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,150
I want to apologise
for last night.

677
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,629
Oh, there's no need.
We know it was not your fault.

678
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,870
You weren't the first drunk in that
dining room, I can assure you.

679
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,549
Only the first republican.

680
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,310
Well, you've got me there.

681
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,429
Why was it you wanted to see me?

682
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,229
We asked Molesley to look out
Matthew's old morning coat.

683
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,269
He's confident he can make it fit.

684
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:31,109
That's very kind, ladies.

685
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,709
But I don't approve
of these costumes.

686
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,829
I see them as the uniform
of oppression

687
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,069
and I should be uncomfortable
wearing them.

688
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:40,070
Have you quite finished?

689
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,830
I have.
Good.

690
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,790
Please take off your coat.

691
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,789
Molesley, do help him.

692
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,790
If you'll just slip it off, sir.

693
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,189
Shouldn't he put the waistcoat
on first?

694
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,909
What's going on? They're forcing me
into a morning coat.

695
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,110
He has no say in it?
No, he doesn't. And nor do you.

696
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,269
Well, what do you think, Molesley?

697
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,230
It'll need lifting a little here,
my lady.

698
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,469
I'll move the buttons.
Fine.

699
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,109
I think the shoulders look odd.

700
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,110
Mm.

701
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,749
Come war and peace,
Downton still stands

702
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,750
and the Crawleys are still in it.

703
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,309
Cora.
Mother, how lovely to see you.

704
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,309
As long as it is.

705
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,590
Robert, aren't you going to kiss
me? With the greatest enthusiasm.

706
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,830
Tell me, where does this come from?

707
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,389
I hired it in Liverpool. Why?

708
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,149
I thought it might be a gift
from the US government

709
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,190
to help get Britain back on its feet.

710
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:12,429
Carson and Mrs Hughes. The world
has moved on since last we met.

711
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,949
And we have moved on with it, madam.

712
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:16,789
Really?

713
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,189
It seems so strange to think
of the English embracing change.

714
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,270
Mrs Hughes, this is my maid - Reed.

715
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,909
Sybil, tell me all about the
arrangements for the birth.

716
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,030
We do these things so much better
in the States.

717
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,950
Edith, still no-one special?

718
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,069
Oh, well, never mind. You must take
a tip from the modern American girl.

719
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,709
Mary, dearest Mary.

720
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,949
Now, you tell me all
of your wedding plans

721
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,230
and I'll see what I can do
to improve them.

722
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,269
What's the matter with you?
Mrs Patmore knows.

723
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,509
Shall I tell you Mrs Levinson's
requirements during her stay?

724
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,270
No, tell her.
Er, yes, Miss Reed. How can I help?

725
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:10,509
To start with I will need goats' milk
in the mornings.

726
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,510
Goats' milk? Fancy that.

727
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,509
She drinks only boiled water.

728
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,869
Really?
In England, that is.

729
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:19,509
Shouldn't Daisy do this?
I ought to take the tea up.

730
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:21,510
I'll have it ready in a moment.

731
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,630
No fats, no crab
and nothing from the marrow family.

732
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,189
Do explain again how exactly

733
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:33,710
you are related to all of us,
Mr Crawley.

734
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,909
Rather distantly, I'm afraid.

735
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:41,709
My great-great-grandfather
was a younger son of a third earl.

736
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:46,109
My. I'm going to have to write
that down, so I can study it.

737
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,309
Look at our page in Burke's.
You'll find Matthew there.

738
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,549
Good. Because I would
so like to understand

739
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:54,750
why he gets to inherit
my late husband's money.

740
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,630
I know. It's funny, isn't it?

741
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,549
Not everyone shares
your sense of humour.

742
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,469
Surely it doesn't matter
now that they're getting married.

743
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,789
In fact, we'd better turn him out
or it'll be bad luck for tomorrow.

744
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,790
Quite right.

745
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:18,069
You must be the chauffeur
I've heard so much about.

746
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,549
I am, ma'am.
Tom's a journalist now, Grandmama.

747
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:25,390
Oh, well, well. I've heard of those
journeys on my side of the water.

748
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,070
It's very pleasant to hear of them
happening here.

749
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,270
It's all right, Mama.
You can leave us unchaperoned.

750
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:37,909
After tomorrow,
all things are permitted.

751
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,989
Don't embarrass me.

752
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,989
Bye, Matthew.

753
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,350
Get a good night's sleep.

754
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,150
How many moments of Crawley history
has this room seen?

755
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,830
And many more to come.

756
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,550
I hope so.

757
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,350
In fact, what happened in the search
for... Mr Pumpkin?

758
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,349
Swire's heir.
Have you heard anything?

759
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:08,550
Yes, Charkham sent a telegram.
I've got it here, actually.

760
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:19,030
'Convincing proof
of Pullbrook's death. Stop.

761
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,670
Investigating date.'

762
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,149
What does that mean?

763
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,349
Well, if Pullbrook died after Reggie
then his heirs get the money.

764
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,429
If he died first, then I do.

765
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,789
But that's absurd. What right have
his heirs to inherit anything?

766
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,149
Darling, what right have I? Frankly,
what difference does it make?

767
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:38,989
I shan't keep it if I get it.

768
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,390
Well, actually, you will.

769
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,710
Because something rather terrible
has happened.

770
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:51,030
You see, apparently Papa
has lost a great deal of money.

771
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,349
Enough to ruin him.

772
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:56,309
Enough for us to lose Downton.

773
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,350
God, I'm sorry.

774
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:04,269
I'm so sorry. Yes, but surely if
Mr Pullbrook did die before Swire,

775
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,310
then we're saved.

776
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,310
Darling, I don't think
you understand.

777
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,589
Reggie Swire put me in his will
because he believed

778
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,630
I was his daughter's one true love.

779
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:19,430
So you were.
Yes, but...

780
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,430
But I broke Lavinia's heart
and she died. He never knew that.

781
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,750
How could I possibly allow myself
to profit from her death to...

782
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,509
to dine in splendour

783
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,789
because I took away
a woman's will to live?

784
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,509
So, you're prepared to destroy us
in payment for your destroying her?

785
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,269
Darling, please. You know
I would do anything for this family.

786
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:43,149
Anything except help us.

787
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,269
Except save Papa from living out
his days in humiliation and grief.

788
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,269
And what about us?
What about our children?

789
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,669
God, Matthew,
how can you be so disappointing?

790
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,509
Mary, please.
No! Don't you see what this means?

791
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,909
Don't you see what a difference
this makes?

792
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,629
It means that you're not on our side,
Matthew.

793
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:03,270
It means that deep down
you're not on our side!

794
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,083
How are you getting on
with your new companion?

795
00:48:26,084 --> 00:48:29,164
I don't like him,
but so far I've kept it to myself.

796
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:33,364
So, who are the bridesmaids?

797
00:48:34,364 --> 00:48:36,963
You don't care about all that?
You're wrong.

798
00:48:37,657 --> 00:48:39,737
It's the stuff of my dreams.

799
00:48:40,057 --> 00:48:43,136
The panic that a dinner won't
be ready, or a frock isn't ironed,

800
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:45,137
or a gun wasn't cleaned.

801
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:47,657
Do you know where you're going
for the honeymoon?

802
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,616
I want to talk about that.

803
00:48:49,617 --> 00:48:52,816
They'll stay in London with
Lady Rosamund for a couple of days,

804
00:48:52,817 --> 00:48:54,817
just to get used to each other...

805
00:48:55,537 --> 00:48:57,657
and then they go
to the South of France.

806
00:48:58,257 --> 00:49:02,297
I'll hire replacements in London
and then I'll come home instead.

807
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:05,256
Lady Mary won't mind. I'll pay.

808
00:49:05,257 --> 00:49:07,336
Why would you do that?

809
00:49:07,337 --> 00:49:09,496
Well, to be near you, of course.

810
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:11,536
Don't you understand?

811
00:49:11,537 --> 00:49:14,776
While I'm in here you have
to live my life as well as your own.

812
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:19,577
Go to France, see some sites,
get us some memories.

813
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:21,817
But I wouldn't be home for a month.

814
00:49:21,818 --> 00:49:23,976
Won't we have something
to talk about?

815
00:49:23,977 --> 00:49:25,977
Go. I insist.

816
00:49:27,377 --> 00:49:29,377
For my sake.

817
00:49:30,737 --> 00:49:32,737
I was so afraid
I was going to be late.

818
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:35,057
Ah ha ha.

819
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:37,777
Violet.

820
00:49:41,057 --> 00:49:42,896
Oh, dear.

821
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:46,176
I'm afraid the war has made
old women of us both.

822
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:50,657
Oh, I wouldn't say that. But then,
I always keep out of the sun.

823
00:49:51,537 --> 00:49:53,736
How do you find Downton
on your return?

824
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:55,576
Much the same, really.

825
00:49:55,577 --> 00:49:58,576
Probably too much the same,
but I don't want to cast a pall

826
00:49:58,577 --> 00:50:02,097
over all the happiness.
How could you ever do that?

827
00:50:03,257 --> 00:50:05,936
Tell me, what do you think
of young Lochinvar

828
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:09,616
who has so ably carried off
our granddaughter and our money?

829
00:50:09,617 --> 00:50:12,336
Do you approve of him?
Not as much as you will...

830
00:50:12,337 --> 00:50:14,536
when you get to know him.

831
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:18,497
Has he gone home to change? Oh, no,
we won't see him again tonight.

832
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:23,177
The groom never sees the bride
the night before the wedding.

833
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:27,256
Nothing ever alters for you people,
does it?

834
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:30,176
Revolutions erupt
and monarchies crash to the ground

835
00:50:30,177 --> 00:50:33,097
and the groom still cannot see
the bride before the wedding.

836
00:50:33,537 --> 00:50:38,297
You Americans never understand
the importance of tradition.

837
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:41,817
Yes, we do.
We just don't give it power over us.

838
00:50:42,377 --> 00:50:45,537
History and tradition took Europe
into a world war.

839
00:50:46,097 --> 00:50:48,857
Maybe you should think about
letting go of its hand.

840
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,176
There you are.

841
00:50:56,177 --> 00:50:58,496
I see you've said hello to Grandmama.

842
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:00,617
She is like a homing pigeon.

843
00:51:02,297 --> 00:51:05,337
She finds our underbelly every time.

844
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:08,697
Dreadful woman.

845
00:51:08,817 --> 00:51:11,976
No, it wasn't me.
Someone sent Sybil and Tom

846
00:51:11,977 --> 00:51:13,857
the price for the tickets to
come over.

847
00:51:13,858 --> 00:51:17,616
Does it matter who it was?
It meant we could be at the wedding.

848
00:51:17,617 --> 00:51:21,256
Of course I wish it had been you,
Papa. But I don't mind.

849
00:51:21,257 --> 00:51:23,176
I thank them, whoever they are.

850
00:51:23,177 --> 00:51:27,336
Well, I'm very glad you're here, but
it wasn't me either, I'm sad to say.

851
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:30,096
I love a mystery. Who could it be?

852
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:33,416
My guess is cousin Isobel.
She always likes to stick her oar in.

853
00:51:33,417 --> 00:51:35,216
I'm going to ask her.

854
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:37,217
For heaven's sake. It was me.

855
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:43,536
You? But it wasn't your writing.

856
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:45,576
No. Smithers did it.

857
00:51:45,577 --> 00:51:48,176
Like all ladies' maids
she lives for intrigue.

858
00:51:48,177 --> 00:51:50,056
You wanted me to come here?

859
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:54,497
I wanted Sybil and her husband
to be here for Mary's wedding, yes.

860
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:57,417
Why keep that secret?

861
00:51:58,057 --> 00:51:59,896
Silly, wasn't it?

862
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,296
I'm very touched. I'll admit it.

863
00:52:02,297 --> 00:52:04,576
How democratic.

864
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:07,177
Makes me think
maybe I have been mistaken in you.

865
00:52:07,617 --> 00:52:09,577
I am a woman of many parts.

866
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:13,977
After all, Branson is...
I mean, Tom...

867
00:52:14,497 --> 00:52:16,536
You're a member of the family now.

868
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:19,097
You'll find we Crawleys
stick together.

869
00:52:19,777 --> 00:52:23,216
Not always.
Mary, what is it?

870
00:52:23,217 --> 00:52:25,217
Nothing, it's just...

871
00:52:27,617 --> 00:52:29,617
Oh, Mary.

872
00:52:33,937 --> 00:52:36,937
Oh, there you are.
That's all for this course.

873
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:39,417
Don't you think, Daisy?

874
00:52:39,937 --> 00:52:42,496
Is Daisy all right, Mrs Patmore?
Oh, yes.

875
00:52:42,497 --> 00:52:44,536
She's been such a big help.

876
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:47,896
Now, I think we should
check the pudding, Daisy.

877
00:52:47,897 --> 00:52:49,936
Don't you agree?

878
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:53,776
It's nerves. Everyone cries
at some point before their wedding.

879
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:55,856
But what was the quarrel about?

880
00:52:55,857 --> 00:52:59,856
I'm not sure. I know she accused him
of not being on our side.

881
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,696
Oh, well, I hope she's wrong.

882
00:53:01,697 --> 00:53:03,456
That could be rather serious.

883
00:53:03,457 --> 00:53:06,896
Of course he's on our side. It's
ridiculous. I'll go and see him.

884
00:53:06,897 --> 00:53:10,937
No, I'll go. I'm his best man.
I should be the one to go.

885
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:14,736
What? I know what it is
to marry into this family.

886
00:53:14,737 --> 00:53:16,856
I'm not comparing myself
to Mr Crawley,

887
00:53:16,857 --> 00:53:19,416
but he is another kind of outsider.
Well, I hardly...

888
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:21,816
Well, why not? He's the one
who'll lose his job

889
00:53:21,817 --> 00:53:23,817
if the wedding's cancelled.

890
00:53:27,937 --> 00:53:31,217
I see what you're doing, you know?
What's that, then?

891
00:53:31,737 --> 00:53:33,976
Not responding to my protest.

892
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,456
Oh... 'Not responding
to my protest.'

893
00:53:36,457 --> 00:53:38,496
Very elegant, I must say.

894
00:53:38,497 --> 00:53:40,336
Who've you been talking to?

895
00:53:40,337 --> 00:53:42,457
Thomas?
Well...

896
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:46,657
Oh, just give me the cloth
and I'll dry.

897
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:56,576
Suppose he never gets the money...
It's not about the money.

898
00:53:56,577 --> 00:53:59,137
It's that he won't save Papa
when he could.

899
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,976
But he has to be true to himself.

900
00:54:02,977 --> 00:54:06,816
That's the point. He puts himself
above the rest of us.

901
00:54:06,817 --> 00:54:08,817
Don't you see?

902
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:12,057
What I see is a good man, my lady.

903
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:15,096
And they're not like buses.

904
00:54:15,097 --> 00:54:18,097
There won't be another one along
in ten minutes' time.

905
00:54:28,977 --> 00:54:30,977
It seems big, but it's not big.

906
00:54:32,697 --> 00:54:34,656
And if it happens?

907
00:54:34,657 --> 00:54:36,776
I get the money.

908
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,777
I can't do what she wants.

909
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:43,617
It's strange for me to be arguing
about inherited money
and saving estates.

910
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:47,017
When the old me would like to put
a bomb under the lot of you.

911
00:54:47,497 --> 00:54:50,937
But?
But you're meant to be together.

912
00:54:51,897 --> 00:54:54,576
I've known that as long
as I've been at the house.

913
00:54:54,577 --> 00:54:57,977
And at first this kept you apart
and then that kept you apart.

914
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,577
But please don't risk it
a third time.

915
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:04,377
Because I'll tell you this.

916
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:08,297
You won't be happy with anyone else
while Lady Mary walks the earth.

917
00:55:08,897 --> 00:55:11,617
Call her Mary, please.
Never mind what I call her.

918
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:16,457
I know what I'll call you
if you let this chance slip
through your fingers.

919
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:33,856
I just need a word.
No. Go away.

920
00:55:33,857 --> 00:55:36,016
I'm undressed. You can't come in.

921
00:55:36,017 --> 00:55:38,536
One word. Come to the door.

922
00:55:38,537 --> 00:55:41,417
Please. Just give him this chance.

923
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,817
I won't look at you.
It'd be unlucky if you did.

924
00:55:45,537 --> 00:55:47,537
Only if we were getting married.

925
00:55:48,177 --> 00:55:50,177
Which we are.

926
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:03,856
My darling, I refuse to quarrel
about something that hasn't happened

927
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:05,616
and probably never will.

928
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:07,617
That's what Anna says.

929
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:10,097
Then she's right.

930
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:15,977
My darling, I'm sure we will fight
about money and about Downton,

931
00:56:16,937 --> 00:56:19,856
about how to rear our children,
about any number of things.

932
00:56:19,857 --> 00:56:22,696
Then shouldn't we accept it?

933
00:56:22,697 --> 00:56:25,057
Matthew, I've been thinking...

934
00:56:25,657 --> 00:56:27,977
And I'm not angry now,
truly I'm not.

935
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:32,296
But if we can disagree over
something as fundamental as this,

936
00:56:32,297 --> 00:56:35,697
then shouldn't we be brave
and back away now?

937
00:56:36,377 --> 00:56:38,176
No.

938
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:41,776
It's not because you're afraid of
calling it off? Because I'm not.

939
00:56:41,777 --> 00:56:43,777
No.

940
00:56:44,297 --> 00:56:46,297
It's because of something Tom said.

941
00:56:49,177 --> 00:56:53,297
That I would never be happy
with anyone else
as long as you walked the earth.

942
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,577
Which is true.

943
00:56:56,817 --> 00:57:00,817
And I think you feel
the same about me.

944
00:57:08,737 --> 00:57:10,737
Can I kiss you?

945
00:57:11,977 --> 00:57:13,977
Because I need to.

946
00:57:14,817 --> 00:57:18,337
Very much.
No. It's bad luck to look at me.

947
00:57:19,297 --> 00:57:21,617
What about if I close my eyes
and you do too?

948
00:57:26,017 --> 00:57:28,056
All right.

949
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:30,057
But you mustn't cheat.

950
00:57:57,857 --> 00:57:59,857
Good night.

951
00:58:17,011 --> 00:58:19,330
Right, I'm off to collect Matthew.

952
00:58:19,331 --> 00:58:23,531
You look very smart. I hope so.
Because I'm extremely uncomfortable.

953
00:58:24,891 --> 00:58:26,891
Branson...

954
00:58:28,011 --> 00:58:30,011
That is, Tom.

955
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:35,130
I want to thank you for what you did
last night. I'm grateful. I mean it.

956
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,930
They're both strong characters.

957
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:40,851
I'd say we have plenty of slamming
doors and shouting matches to come.

958
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,290
Forgive me,
I was about to be indignant,

959
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:46,811
but you have a perfect right
to speak as you do.

960
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:49,010
I hope you mean that too.

961
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:50,970
I do.

962
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:52,971
Now, hurry up.

963
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:58,091
You'd ask if there was anything
you wanted me to tell you.

964
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:01,770
I mean, I'm sure you know.
More than you did.

965
00:59:01,771 --> 00:59:04,930
And relax. There isn't anything
I need to hear now.

966
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:08,971
Because when two people love each
other, you understand, everything...

967
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:13,531
It's the most terrific fun.

968
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:16,131
Careful, Mama, or you'll shock Anna.

969
00:59:16,811 --> 00:59:21,330
I'm a married woman now, my lady.
I think we should go.

970
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:24,210
What about Anna? How are you going
to get to the church?

971
00:59:24,211 --> 00:59:26,210
They're waiting for me
in the wagonette.

972
00:59:26,211 --> 00:59:28,211
I'll see you there.

973
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:32,331
I know mine was a wild
runaway marriage, darling.

974
00:59:33,251 --> 00:59:35,450
And yours is the one
everyone wanted.

975
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:39,971
What's so thrilling is that
this is every bit as romantic.

976
00:59:40,651 --> 00:59:43,291
Thank you, for always being so sweet.

977
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:54,171
Love and position in one handsome
package. Who could ask for more?

978
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,891
Never mind Edith.

979
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:07,131
Well, very, very good luck,
my beautiful daughter.

980
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:25,810
Now, you've a great big porter cab
all to yourselves. Think of that.

981
01:00:25,811 --> 01:00:29,810
So we'll expect you to behave
as if you were quite grown up.

982
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:31,811
You can do that, can't you?

983
01:00:32,491 --> 01:00:34,330
Got everything you need?
Yes.

984
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:36,331
Hop in, then.

985
01:00:36,611 --> 01:00:38,611
Careful with your dress.

986
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:42,850
Settle down.

987
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,851
All right?

988
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:48,771
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Bye.

989
01:00:50,891 --> 01:00:53,731
Bye-bye.
Good luck!

990
01:01:04,491 --> 01:01:06,490
Have you got everything you need?
We do.

991
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:09,411
Now, be off with you
and enjoy yourself.

992
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:12,290
I wish we were going.

993
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,011
Who'll get the food ready
for when they come back?

994
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,611
Still, fetch your coat
and we'll see her off.

995
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:23,211
Right, see you in a minute.

996
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:30,970
We're just leaving now, my lord.
As soon as we've got Anna.

997
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:32,971
Here comes the bride.

998
01:02:00,651 --> 01:02:02,651
Will I do, Carson?

999
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:06,691
Very nicely, my lady.

1000
01:02:12,491 --> 01:02:15,930
Thank heavens you got everything
settled. You had me worried.

1001
01:02:15,931 --> 01:02:19,491
It's not quite settled, I'm afraid.
He won't get off that easily.

1002
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:22,490
But you're happy?

1003
01:02:22,491 --> 01:02:24,491
I am.

1004
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:26,971
And what about you?

1005
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:34,571
I'm so happy, so very happy,
I feel my chest will explode.

1006
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:55,690
It's so lovely that you're here.
Come behind us.

1007
01:02:55,691 --> 01:02:58,851
I can't. I'm not family.
But you almost are.

1008
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:04,291
Morning.
Thank you.

1009
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:10,490
Molesley, I'm very grateful to you

1010
01:03:10,491 --> 01:03:12,531
for keeping Mr Branson
up to the mark.

1011
01:03:12,931 --> 01:03:15,811
We both are, aren't we?
We certainly are.

1012
01:03:16,571 --> 01:03:18,571
Thank you, sir.

1013
01:03:24,491 --> 01:03:27,091
This is a proud day, Mrs Hughes.

1014
01:03:27,691 --> 01:03:31,651
I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm
very glad you're happy, Mr Carson.

1015
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:35,970
You're next, darling, you'll see.
Will I?

1016
01:03:35,971 --> 01:03:39,171
So encouraging
to see the future unfurl.

1017
01:03:40,971 --> 01:03:45,811
As long as you remember it will bear
no resemblance to the past.

1018
01:04:35,251 --> 01:04:37,251
Good luck.

1019
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:15,891
You came.

1020
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:19,371
To be honest,
I wasn't completely sure you would.

1021
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:23,371
I'm glad to hear it.
I should hate to be predictable.

1022
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:29,931
I'm sorry, it still seems odd
to be found in your bed.

1023
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:33,090
Isn't it dangerous to let
this Strallan nonsense simmer on?

1024
01:05:33,091 --> 01:05:34,850
Ask him to end it.

1025
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:37,570
Somehow the poor chap
managed to burn a hole in my tails.

1026
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:40,370
This is what comes of making him run
before he could walk.

1027
01:05:40,371 --> 01:05:42,490
We've 20 lords and ladies
in the drawing room

1028
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:44,491
and we've got no dinner
to give them.

1029
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:49,050
♪ Let me call you 'sweetheart'

1030
01:05:49,051 --> 01:05:51,051
♪ I'm in love with...

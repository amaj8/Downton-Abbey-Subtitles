1
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,860
Last June...

2
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,060
saw Emily Davison...

3
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,260
crushed to death beneath the hooves
of the king's horse!

4
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,860
Will the summer of 1914

5
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,540
prove as fatal
for the hopes of women?

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,260
It cannot!
(HUBBUB)

7
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,660
This historic by-election...

8
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,700
..has been a first step
on the journey to women's equality.

9
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,860
If you're so keen on women's rights,
let a woman speak!

10
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,700
Why stop there? Let's get the dogs
up and listen to them bark (!)

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,220
(JEERING)

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,940
We are winning! Winning!

13
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,060
You all right, My Lady?

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,180
Isn't it exciting?

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,980
(SPEECH CONTINUES OVER JEERING)

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,220
You're an idiot, man!

17
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,380
I think it's time
for Branson to take you home.

18
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,740
Not yet.
I think so.

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,260
I applaud your spirit in coming and
I will applaud your discretion
when you go.

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,220
But you agree with everything
he says. I do, my dear.

21
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,140
But I also know, if anything happens
to you, Branson will lose his place.

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,020
Better safe than sorry, My Lady.

23
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,860
..is an act of mercy. I disagree!

24
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,100
(JEERING)
The car is just here.

25
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,740
Women must get the vote,
mustn't they, Branson?

26
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,260
Why does the prime minister
resist the inevitable?

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,940
Politicians can't often recognise
the changes that are inevitable.

28
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,260
I hope you do go into politics.
It's a fine ambition.

29
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,260
Ambition, or dream?

30
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,380
If I do...

31
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,300
it's not all about
women and the vote, for me.
Nor even freedom for Ireland.

32
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,500
It's the gap between
the aristocracy and the poor and...

33
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,140
And what?

34
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,460
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,500
I don't mean to speak against
His Lordship.

36
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,620
Why not?
You obviously don't approve of him.

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:22,060
Not as a representative
of an oppressive class.

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,660
But he's a good man.

39
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,740
And a decent employer.

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,900
Spoken like a true politician.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,020
(CHUCKLES)

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,060
What do I look like?

43
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,260
Could you sneak me round the back?

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,660
I should hate for Papa
to see me like this.

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,380
WOMAN: Where? I'm not a mind reader!

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,100
Mrs Patmore is very cruel
to that poor girl.

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,060
Mrs Patmore is frightened.

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,380
Is she right to be? Dr Clarkson
has confirmed she has cataracts.

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,740
What can be done about it?
There are treatments.

50
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,940
But even the best are uncertain.

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,540
She doesn't want to risk
losing what sight she still has.

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
I don't blame her.

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,660
But it can't go on for ever.

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,980
No.

55
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,140
Oh, dear.

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,380
Have you had bad news?

57
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,540
I shouldn't have bothered you.
No.

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,380
You weren't to know.

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,820
Oh!
Excuse me, My Lady.

60
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,580
William, will you find Anna
and tell her I've gone upstairs?

61
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,860
Very good, My Lady.

62
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,140
Ooh, sorry.
You clumsy clodhopper!

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,220
Sorry.
You will be when I'm done with you.

64
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,180
Leave him alone.
Anna? Lady Sybil's back from Ripon.

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,460
She's gone up to her room.
Thank you.

66
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Why does she waste
her precious time on politics?

67
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,940
Hear, hear! Don't you believe in
rights for women, Thomas?

68
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,060
What's it to you? Well, I know you
don't believe in rights of property.

69
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,300
Some people might find that
interesting.

70
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,420
Who's going to tell them? You?

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,860
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,900
Mr Carson? Are you all right?

73
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,940
Why shouldn't I be?

74
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,380
You never rung the dressing gong.
And Mrs Patmore's

75
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,300
doing a souffle
for the first course.

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,940
Oh, my God!

77
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,220
Rather unlike Carson.

78
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,340
We'd better go straight into dinner.

79
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
I shall tell Miss O'Brien and Anna.

80
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,980
Any more news of the by-election?

81
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,900
Mr Crawley was here. He said his
mother had gone to the Liberal
rally in Ripon.

82
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,780
I heard it was...quite lively.

83
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,820
I daresay the townies will make
the usual stink when the Tory
candidate's returned.

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,220
I'm not sure. I heard the Liberal
was given a hard time today.

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,380
Mr Branson said it was
getting out of hand when they left.

86
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,540
Typical Branson to be there.

87
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,700
I hope he squared it with Carson.
Who went with him?

88
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,220
Er...

89
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,460
Not sure anyone went with him, sir.
You said 'they.' Who was with him?

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,020
I'd rather not say.

91
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,220
Bates? Who was with him?

92
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Lady Sybil.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,380
Lady Sybil?! Why?

94
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,060
I should never have mentioned it,
My Lord. I thought you knew.

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,620
No. I did not know.

96
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,020
I gather you went to hear
the Liberal candidate today.

97
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,500
There were several speakers,
actually. He was the last.

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,020
Did he speak well?

99
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,060
I thought so.
There was quite a brouhaha.

100
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,420
You know what these things
can be like. I do.

101
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,060
Hence my astonishment you should not
feel it necessary to ask my
permission to attend!

102
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,460
I assume this was Branson's scheme.
No. I confess,

103
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,900
I was amused to have an Irish
radical as a chauffeur.

104
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,860
But I see now I've been naive!
I told Branson to take Sybil.

105
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,100
What are you saying?!
Sybil needed to go to Ripon.

106
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,300
I asked Branson to drive her.
I thought it would be sensible.

107
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,580
In case there was trouble.
I want to do some canvassing.

108
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,140
The by-election isn't far off.
Canvassing?

109
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,340
Oh, it's quite safe. You're in
a group and you knock on doors.

110
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,100
Yes, I know what canvassing is.
I think that Sybil is -

111
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,060
What? Are you canvassing too?

112
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,740
Or would you rather
take in washing (?)

113
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,820
I was only going to say that Sybil
is entitled to her opinions. No.

114
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,180
She isn't until she is married.

115
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,460
Then her husband will tell her
what her opinions are.

116
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,860
Oh, Granny! I knew you wouldn't
approve. Which, presumably,

117
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,580
is why you all hid your plans
from me.

118
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,820
Her Ladyship'll have a smacked
bottom if she's not careful.
Hurry up.

119
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,740
I don't want anything else
to go wrong.

120
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,540
Where's the sauce?
Doesn't this have Hollandaise?

121
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,980
I'll get it. I won't be a jiffy.
Would you do that for me?

122
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,740
I'd do anything for you.

123
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,700
Does this mean you won't be
presented next month?

124
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,060
Certainly not. Why should it?

125
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,540
Well, I doubt I'd expect to
curtsey to their majesties in June

126
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,300
when I'd been arrested
at a riot in May.

127
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,820
But then, I'm old.
Things may be different now.

128
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,940
She hasn't been arrested
and it wasn't a riot.

129
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,180
But it might be next time.
There will not be a next time.

130
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,380
Her Ladyship's not best pleased
at being told off in public.

131
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,260
William said
she was looking daggers.

132
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm sorry I started all this.
Oh, it's not your fault.

133
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,260
He ought to be glad
he's got a daughter who cares.

134
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Her Ladyship's ready to leave.

135
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,260
I'll bring the car round.

136
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,380
You pleased with yourself (?)

137
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,580
Silly chump.

138
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,860
He's nervous. He thinks I'm planning
to tell Mr Carson about the wine.

139
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,340
Well, he shouldn't have stolen it,
then.

140
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,460
No.

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,020
But I don't want anyone
to lose their job because of me.

142
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,220
Even Thomas?

143
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,100
Even after
what they tried to do to you?

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,580
Even then.

145
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,900
Your Ladyship. Do you have a moment?
Of course.

146
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,020
I have received a letter, My Lady.

147
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,420
From a friend of mine. He's valet
to the Marquess of Flintshire.

148
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,780
I don't envy him. Lord Flintshire
is a minister at the Foreign Office.

149
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,740
As you know, Lady Flintshire
is His Lordship's cousin.

150
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,780
Oh, of course, of course.
The point is,

151
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,380
he has dealings with
the Turkish Ambassador.

152
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,140
It seems His Excellency has made him
privy to a scurrilous story

153
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,060
concerning Lady Mary and the late...

154
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,780
Mr Pamuk.

155
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,620
May I read this letter?

156
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,860
Is there anything
you want me to do about it?

157
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,020
No. Thank you.

158
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,380
Sometimes, even to deny these
things is only to throw paraffin
onto the flames.

159
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,060
I did try to inform His Lordship.
What?

160
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,700
But I...couldn't seem to find
the right moment.

161
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Quite right.

162
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,820
Please leave His Lordship to me.

163
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,740
I'm sorry. The only sure way
to get rid of a servant

164
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,980
is to have him or her
suspected of stealing.

165
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,860
We've tried that,
and it didn't work.

166
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,220
But last time, we invented a theft.

167
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,900
We need to make him a suspect when
something's really been stolen.

168
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,060
How do we know anything's been
stolen? Because you stole it.

169
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,300
You noodle!
You mean the wine? Yeah. The wine.

170
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,580
But Bates knows I took it. He was
threatening to tell Mr Carson.

171
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,020
Well, he can't, can he?
Not if we get in first.

172
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,300
Are you telling me
you saw him take the cellar key?

173
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,500
Not exactly. But I saw him in here.

174
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,380
And I thought
the key was swinging on its hook.

175
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,700
I just wondered if
any of the wine was missing.

176
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,780
I think I owe you an apology
after the way I spoke at dinner.

177
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,300
Next time you want to treat me
like a naughty schoolgirl,

178
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,740
you might do it in private,
not in front of the servants.

179
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,620
You're right. I'm sorry.
Course, it gave your mother
her best evening since Christmas.

180
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,740
Even so, we must try
to keep control of Sybil.

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,620
Robert.

182
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,260
Believe me, Sybil...
is not your problem.

183
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,580
We've got to support Mary this year,
when we get to London.

184
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,780
But it's Sybil's first season.

185
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,100
We can't have Mary
stealing her thunder.

186
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,340
Sybil will do well enough.
It's time Mary was settled.

187
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,340
High time.

188
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,700
Poor old Edith.
We never seem to talk about her.

189
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,220
I'm afraid Edith will be the one
to care for us in our old age.

190
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,340
What a ghastly prospect?

191
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,620
Mamma? Anna said you wanted me.

192
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,140
Look who's paid us a visit.
Sir Anthony!

193
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,260
How nice.

194
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,740
We all thought we'd driven you away
with that horrible salty pudding.

195
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,660
No, indeed. (LAUGHS)
But I have been away.

196
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,620
He's been in Austria and Germany.

197
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,380
How interesting.

198
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,100
Interesting and worrying.

199
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,900
Sir Anthony's here
to show you his new car.

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh. Yes. I've rather taken to
driving myself.

201
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,860
I have to keep finding destinations
to justify it.

202
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,060
What kind of car is it?
It's an open Rolls Royce.

203
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,700
And I wondered if
you might like a spin in it.

204
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,260
Oh, how kind. But, alas, not today.

205
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,100
I've had Diamond saddled
and he's waiting for me.

206
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,820
You could ride this afternoon.
But it's arranged now.

207
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,020
But thank you, Sir Anthony.

208
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,620
Do ask me again.

209
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,380
I...don't suppose you'd take me.

210
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,260
Of course. I shall be delighted.

211
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,420
What is it that I'm accused of?

212
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
Oh...nobody's accusing you
of anything.

213
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,260
But there has been a suggestion
that you were handling

214
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,020
the cellar key.
And, before I take it any further,

215
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,260
I want to find
if there's a simple explanation.

216
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,460
Because some wine is missing.

217
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,900
How do you know that?

218
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,460
Right. Well.

219
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,820
We'll leave it there for now.

220
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,220
The Kaiser
is such a mercurial figure.

221
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,260
One minute the warlord...

222
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,420
the next a lovelorn poet.

223
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,420
But a poet in need of an empire.

224
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,460
That's very good.

225
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,580
Poet in need of an empire. Yes.

226
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,780
My late wife used to say that...

227
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,140
What did Lady Strallan used to say?
Oh, never mind.

228
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
But I should like to hear it.
Really?

229
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,820
Would you really?

230
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,780
She used to say that Kaiser Bill
loved uniforms and medals...

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,300
..but he never really
connected them with fighting.

232
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,940
What was she like?
Maud?

233
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,100
Oh, she was awfully funny.

234
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,140
Some people couldn't see it,
but she was.

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,740
Is Lynch anywhere about?
I haven't seen him, My Lady.

236
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,100
My horse is lame.
Well, I could have a look at him.

237
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,340
Do you know about horses? I looked
after them on my father's farm.

238
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,500
It was the best job in the world.
Then why did you leave it?

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,820
My mother wanted me
to better myself.

240
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,300
As a second footman?
It's a good place for me, My Lady.

241
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,380
Of course it is. I'm sorry.

242
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,940
She hopes, one day, that
I might be first footman. Or even

243
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,900
get to be...
Carson had better watch out.

244
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,060
Stranger things happen at sea.

245
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,740
I've seen Mr Bates with a bottle
from time to time.

246
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,780
I must've thought
he was helping you.

247
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,180
Why would I order a valet
to help with the wine?

248
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,460
When you put it like that,
of course you wouldn't.

249
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,620
So. Mr Bates is taking wine.

250
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,500
And why would this be? To drink it?

251
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,740
It's not to clean his boots (!)
Thank you, Thomas.

252
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,260
Daisy? Thomas says you have
something to add to this. Well...

253
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,980
You're not in any trouble,
or any danger of trouble.

254
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,180
You remember what you saw.

255
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,260
I may have seen him...
coming out of the cellar.

256
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,340
May.

257
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,180
Did you or didn't you?

258
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,060
It's very hard for the girl,
Mr Carson. You're frightening her.

259
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,900
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,220
Thank you. You may go.

261
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,380
Thank you, O'Brien.

262
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,620
How is everything downstairs?

263
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,540
All right, I think, My Lady.
Though Mr Carson's a bit cast down.

264
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
Oh? Why? What's the matter with him?

265
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,980
He's found out something about...

266
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,860
Well...a person he admires.

267
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,740
And it isn't very nice.

268
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,940
Has he said who this person is...

269
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,140
..who's proved a disappointment?

270
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,620
I don't like to say, My Lady.

271
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Please do, if you know.

272
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,220
Oh, I know.

273
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
It's Mr Bates.

274
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,300
Oh, Bates? Why? What's he done?

275
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,700
You should ask Mr Carson, My Lady.
It's not my place to tell.

276
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,020
Papa.

277
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,220
Can...Branson drive me into Ripon...
on Friday evening?

278
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,260
I don't think so, no.
Not after the last time.

279
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,260
Oh, please. There's a meeting
of my borstal charity.

280
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,340
I've missed two,
and I simply must be there.

281
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,900
You'd have to take
Mary or Edith with you.

282
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,940
Don't make me. Those meetings
are deadly at the best of times.

283
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,980
And you know what they're like
when they're bored.

284
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,180
Why are all your causes
so steeped in gloom?

285
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,900
Because it's the gloomy things
that need our help.

286
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,420
If everything in the garden's
sunny...why meddle?

287
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,780
Well, I agree with that.

288
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,900
Talking of sunny, are you looking
forward to your coming season?

289
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,780
I am rather.

290
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,100
Hello. What are you doing here?

291
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm in search of your father.
Carson thought he was outside.

292
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,060
He's in the library.

293
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,660
What is it? Nothing much. I've had
an enquiry about one of the farms.

294
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,300
Ah.

295
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,180
So.

296
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,260
What's new at the big house?

297
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,460
Oh. Sybil, mainly.

298
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,780
She's discovered politics, which,
of course, makes Papa see red.

299
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,340
I admire Sybil's passion, though.

300
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,220
Of course.

301
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,620
But then, I like a good argument.
Papa does not.

302
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,300
If you really like an argument...

303
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,940
Yes?
We should see more of each other.

304
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,980
So, it's all right? I can go?

305
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,820
(DOG WHINES)

306
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,940
Will you be late?

307
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,060
I think I'll miss dinner.
Well, remember

308
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,660
to tell Branson to take a sandwich
for himself.

309
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,700
But who's it from?
Susan Flintshire.

310
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,780
What does she say?

311
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,180
Well, prepare yourself for the worst.

312
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,340
Not the first page.

313
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,180
My poor niece never uses one word
when twenty will do.

314
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,860
Start there. 'I am sorry...'

315
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,380
'I am sorry to have to tell you

316
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,100
that Hugh has heard a vile story
about your granddaughter Mary.'

317
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,540
Sorry? She's thrilled (!)

318
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,780
Now. First I must ask...

319
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,500
And I want you to think carefully
before you answer.

320
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,780
Is any of this true?

321
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,060
I see.

322
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,980
Some of it IS true.

323
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,100
How much?

324
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,780
Oh, dear.

325
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,060
She didn't drag him.

326
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,260
I wondered about that. Obviously,
Susan's forgotten...the distance

327
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,140
between the girls' rooms
and the bachelor's corridor.

328
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,300
She couldn't manage it alone.
So, how did she do it?

329
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,420
I helped her. She woke me up.
And I helped her.

330
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,460
Well...

331
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,660
I always thought...this family
might be approaching dissolution...

332
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,940
I didn't know dissolution
was already upon us.

333
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,620
Does Robert know?

334
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,660
No. And he isn't going to.

335
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,380
Oh.

336
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,900
Of course, it was terribly wrong.
It was all terribly wrong.
But I didn't see wha-

337
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,100
Please.

338
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,460
I can't listen to your attempts
to try and justify yourself.

339
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,740
I know this is hard for you to hear.

340
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,980
God knows, it was
hard for me to live through.

341
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
But if you expect me
to disown my daughter...

342
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,860
..I'm afraid you will be
disappointed.

343
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,780
Good day.

344
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,220
I thought you must be out here.

345
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,100
And you'd be right.

346
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,580
I know you're upset.
Yes, I'm upset.

347
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,220
I've been working here two years.

348
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,740
And yet, Mr Carson has no difficulty
believing the worst of me.

349
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,060
I think he has
a great deal of difficulty.

350
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,460
Which is why he hasn't
told His Lordship yet.

351
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,460
Can't you just explain about Thomas?
No, no.

352
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,500
It would sound like
a false accusation.

353
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,100
You can't take it lying down.

354
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,180
Because you're not guilty
of any wrong.

355
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,700
And, before it's over,
I'm gonna tell the world.

356
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,780
Are you?

357
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,020
I'm not sure the world is listening.

358
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,500
Sorry. I'm a bit late tonight.

359
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,660
Not to worry. How are you?

360
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,940
Bearing up.

361
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,340
This isn't the end.
You mustn't give up.

362
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,460
We'll get there.

363
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,780
Forgive me, My Lady, but...

364
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,980
You don't get it.

365
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,580
You're brought up to think
it's all within your grasp.

366
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,620
That if you want something enough,
it will come to you.

367
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,940
Well, we're not like that.

368
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,540
We don't think our dreams
are bound to come true, because...

369
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,780
Because they almost never do.

370
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,820
Then, that's why we must
stick together.

371
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,740
Your dream is my dream now.

372
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,820
I'll make it come true.

373
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,740
Why hasn't he done anything?
He's had the story and the witnesses.

374
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,900
The witnesses?

375
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,060
What do you think this is?
A murder mystery?

376
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,380
Mr Bates can't accuse me now.
It'll sound as if he's trying
to get his own back.

377
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,620
If I lose my job over this,
I swear to God, I'll swing for you.

378
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,300
Is there any stale bread
you're throwing out?

379
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
And some salt.
Why?

380
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,140
Well, I thought I'd make
a last hot poultice for Diamond.

381
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,980
It'll give him a better night.
You big softy.

382
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,380
What'll Mr Lynch say?
Oh, he doesn't mind.

383
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,060
He says I've got the touch.

384
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,780
He thinks I should pack this in
and be a groom. Why don't you?

385
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,820
My mum...

386
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,580
She was so excited when I came here.

387
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,660
They're proud of me,
and I'd hate to spoil that.

388
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,260
Do you miss 'em?

389
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,740
I never had that in my childhood.

390
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,100
Someone you could always trust.

391
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Well, I trust them, they trust me.

392
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,140
There are no lies in our house.

393
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,140
Thanks. That's enough.

394
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,180
I'm glad to catch you.

395
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,140
We have a conundrum at the hospital,
and I would value your opinion.

396
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,540
Of course.
We've been treating...

397
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,580
the mother of your footman
William Mason.

398
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,780
What's the matter with her?
Heart, I'm afraid.

399
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,660
She's forbidden us to say anything
to her son. That's ridiculous.

400
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,580
She's gone home now,
but she's still very ill.

401
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,620
Clearly, the boy should
go and see her.

402
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,260
And I assume you would
have no objections? Course not.

403
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,180
So.

404
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,220
Do we break a patient's confidence
and disobey her orders...or not?

405
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,860
We can't...if she's forbidden it.

406
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,100
I must say, I agree with you.

407
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,700
Well, I'll tell him.
No. You will not.

408
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,460
She has rights, too.
And there are rules.

409
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,300
I don't care a fig about rules.

410
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,380
Where to from here, My Lady?

411
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,500
What do you mean? We've arrived?
The meeting's in this place?

412
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,300
This IS the meeting. We're here
for the counting of the votes.

413
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,820
I don't understand. I thought that -

414
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,460
Don't be silly, Branson.
You didn't think I'd
miss my very first by-election.

415
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,100
His Lordship won't approve.
Let me worry about him.

416
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,940
I have to park the car. Don't move!
Stay where you are! Really!

417
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,100
I thought I gave the orders.
(CAR HORN TOOTS)

418
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,620
Sir Anthony Strallan.
Sir Anthony.

419
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,660
Don't worry.
I haven't got the date wrong.

420
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,780
What a relief. I could hear Cora
wondering if dinner would stretch (!)

421
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,980
No, I'm not really here at all.

422
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,860
But I was driving past your gates
and I thought I'd take a chance.

423
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,140
See, the thing is,
I've got two tickets for a concert
in York next Friday.

424
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
How nice. Although, I can't -

425
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,940
No.

426
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,060
I was hoping that Lady Edith
might like to accompany me.

427
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,060
But I'd love to. Shouldn't you
ask what sort of concert it is?

428
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,740
Oh, just Hungry Hundreds stuff,
mostly. You know.

429
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,860
Bellini, Puccini, Rossini.
I'm not up to anything complicated.

430
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,220
I...I'd like that very much.

431
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,820
Excellent. Well, it's quite a hike,
so I'll pick you up around six?

432
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,820
Lady Jervas has asked us for a bite
to eat after, if that's all right
with your mother.

433
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,940
By all means.
Well, I must run.

434
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,860
I hope I haven't spoilt your dinner.

435
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,020
We may have to
hire a nurse after all (!)

436
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,660
Oh, for heaven's sake hold it
steady, if you don't want to start
again from the beginning.

437
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,900
Do these biscuits go up? No. I put
them out for the fairies (!) Oh.

438
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,020
Of course they're going up!

439
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,300
What's wrong with you?

440
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,140
You're always dozy, but tonight
you make Sleeping Beauty look alert.

441
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,420
I was just thinking... Ooh, Blimey!
Batten down the hatches (!)

442
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,020
I think I've let myself down.

443
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,900
It can't be a new sensation.

444
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,300
The Honourable Joseph Gerald Ansty...
(CLAMOUR)

445
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,260
..for the Conservative
and Unionist Party...

446
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,580
6,363 votes.

447
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,700
Votes for women! Votes for women!

448
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,380
Martin James Dillon,
the Socialist Party...

449
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,700
2,741 votes.

450
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,500
Call it a day, My Lady!
Don't be silly. This is the moment

451
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,660
we've come for.

452
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,620
Trevor Andrew Morgan,
the Liberal Party...

453
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,620
This lot aren't interested in votes.
They're spoiling for a fight!

454
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,380
..5,894 votes.

455
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,540
I hereby declare...

456
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,860
Come on.
Out you get, lads.

457
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,260
We'll soon wipe the smile off
their Tory bloody faces!

458
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,220
..is duly elected...to serve
as member of parliament...

459
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,540
..member of parliament... Sybil!
..for the Ripon constituency.

460
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,660
What are you doing here?
I couldn't miss this.

461
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,900
Couldn't you? I could!

462
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,740
I don't like the look of this,
My Lady!

463
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,140
Look. Look!

464
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,380
I'm on your side. Don't cause any
trouble. Believe me!

465
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,780
What's your problem, Mr Lah-di-dah?
My problem is you.

466
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,260
Oh, aye?

467
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,860
Oh, no. Oh, please, God, no!

468
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,620
This way!

469
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,180
I fetched a coat.
Why? What do I need a coat for?

470
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,300
I've come to fetch you, My Lady.

471
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,220
We've taken Lady Sybil
to Crawley House.

472
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,300
What's happened?

473
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
I took her to Ripon for the count.

474
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,380
She got injured in a fight.

475
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,780
Take me there at once.

476
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,940
My God!

477
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,660
Oh, my darling!

478
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,100
I didn't know what to do.
I had Branson bring her here.

479
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,220
Quite right. Mamma would have
fainted if she'd seen her like this.

480
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,740
As for Papa...
This will sting a bit.

481
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,820
But it's stopped bleeding.

482
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,660
Did you know she was planning this?

483
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,980
Of course not.
Well, what were you doing there?

484
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,740
Working late. I'd forgotten it was
election night, or I wouldn't
have stayed.

485
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,140
I'm so grateful you did.
Oh, I could wring Branson's neck!

486
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,180
What was he thinking? I'm afraid
it'll cost him his job. No!

487
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,340
I told him he was taking me
to a committee meeting.

488
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,780
When he saw what it was,
he wanted to come straight back.

489
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,780
You'll have to stick up for him.

490
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,980
Because Papa will skin him alive.

491
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,100
Are you feeling strong enough
to go home?

492
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,180
I think so.

493
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,660
If you'll take me.

494
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,940
Here. Wear my coat
to cover the blood.

495
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,860
You'll look more normal.

496
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,060
Lean on me.

497
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,740
Thank you so much for this.

498
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,780
By the way.
How is William's mother?

499
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,100
Not good, I'm afraid. She's home,
but she's still very weak.

500
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,620
Another attack should finish her.
And he still doesn't know?

501
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,620
She's adamant. I've tried to explain
how hard it'll be on him.

502
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,780
But she won't have him disturbed.

503
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,060
To hear her talk, you'd think
he was a cabinet minister.

504
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,660
He's made her proud.

505
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,300
There are plenty of children
in grander circumstances who'd love
to say the same.

506
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,100
I wish you'd tell me
what's troubling you.

507
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,100
If it's this business
with Mr Bates...

508
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,500
It's not that.
I'll get to the bottom of that.

509
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,700
Well, I hope you'll do it soon.

510
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,900
If there's one thing I hate,
it's an atmosphere.

511
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,140
And we've got a real atmosphere
going now.

512
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,180
It's an unfair rumour
which needs to be scotched.

513
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,700
It's very hard to hear
the names of people you love

514
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,660
dragged in the mud.

515
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,780
You feel so powerless.

516
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,940
Well. I...

517
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,020
respect Mr Bates, but...
I'm not sure that I love him.

518
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,140
I wasn't thinking of Mr Bates.

519
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,660
(KNOCKING)

520
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,380
Mr Carson, have you got a minute?
What is it, Daisy?

521
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,460
Mr Carson's a very busy man.

522
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,620
I know he is.
But I think he'll want to hear this.

523
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,140
I told you something
that wasn't true.

524
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,780
Why would you do that?
I did it as a favour...

525
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,260
for a friend. But I know
now it was wrong to ask it of me.

526
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,660
She's not badly hurt, is she?
I don't think so, no.

527
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,180
Thank God.

528
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,100
Better be prepared. I'm afraid
Lord Grantham will hit the roof.

529
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,820
I never would've taken her there.

530
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,060
I may be a socialist,
but I'm not a lunatic.

531
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,100
I'm not sure Papa
knows the difference.

532
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,180
You'll let me know how she gets on?

533
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,820
Please.

534
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,580
If you wish.

535
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,920
How dare you? How DARE you

536
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,840
disobey me in this way?!
Robert. I'm sure -

537
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,440
Are you so knowledgeable...

538
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,600
(DISTANT RANTING)

539
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,880
Papa, I'm sorry I disobeyed you.

540
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,480
But I'm interested, I'm political,
I have opinions!

541
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,240
Of course, I blame Branson.
I don't think that's fair.
We had none of this.

542
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,400
None of it!
Until he set foot in our house.

543
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,880
I suppose I should give thanks
he hasn't burnt the place down
over our heads!

544
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,960
Branson knew nothing
until we arrived there.

545
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,160
He leaves tonight.

546
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,560
If you punish Branson, I'll never
speak to you again. Never!

547
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,080
I don't believe this is Branson's
fault. Truly, Papa. Blame me.

548
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,280
I do blame you!
Robert, can we do this

549
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,920
in the morning? Sybil needs rest.

550
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,320
But if I find tomorrow
that Branson is missing...

551
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,440
I'll run away, I warn you.

552
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,760
Oh! And where would you go?

553
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,040
Well, I can't think now.
But I will go. And you'll be sorry.

554
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,800
I should be sorry. Very sorry indeed.

555
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800
(APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS)

556
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,120
How is she?

557
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,480
She'll be perfectly fine.
I gather you're the shining knight
in all this.

558
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,840
Not really. But I'm glad
I was there. So am I, by heaven.

559
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,760
If it had been left to
that bloody fool Branson...

560
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,320
You should see what he reads.
It's all Marx and Ruskin

561
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,000
and John Stuart Mill. I ask you.
Papa prefers

562
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,760
the servants to read the Bible
and letters from home (!)

563
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,040
There are sandwiches for Mr Crawley
in the dining room, Lady Mary.

564
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,440
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

565
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,680
We couldn't let you starve.
You really didn't have to.

566
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,640
Mary, you look after Matthew.
I'll go up and revive your mother.

567
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,520
Do you stand by your story?

568
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,880
I don't have a story.
You saw Mr Bates in here alone,
hanging up the cellar key.

569
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,200
To me, that is a story.
I only said I might have seen him.
I suppose I was wrong.

570
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,160
And Miss O'Brien. Were you then wrong
when you thought you saw Mr Bates
carrying a bottle?

571
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,320
You wicked creature!
Anna.

572
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,040
You are here to watch,
not to participate.

573
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,640
I don't think I was wrong, no.

574
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,760
What do you say to that, Mr Bates?

575
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,520
I know this to be untrue
because I have no need of it.

576
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,760
Since I arrived at Downton...

577
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,440
you have never seen me...
drink one drop of alcohol.

578
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Let us say, then,
that Miss O'Brien was...mistaken.

579
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
Mistaken, my eye!

580
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,440
And Daisy, we all know the value
of your contribution. Yes, Mr Carson.

581
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,480
But I must ask one thing, Mr Bates.

582
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,360
How did you know
the wine had been taken?

583
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

584
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:07,080
We can drink to Sybil's safe return.

585
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,240
Why not?

586
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,160
I'll ring for a glass.
No, never mind that.

587
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,360
Here.

588
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,520
You're not very fastidious about
doing things properly, are you?

589
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Are you?

590
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,400
Less than you might think.

591
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Are you at all political?

592
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,240
Yes.

593
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,960
But with a hung parliament, it's hard
to get excited about a by-election.

594
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
You know, nothing will change...

595
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,960
whoever gets in.

596
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,800
If I might keep you for a minute
more, Mr Carson...

597
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,040
If you'd like me to leave... No. I
would like you to stay, Mrs Hughes.

598
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,400
And you, Anna.

599
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,720
You have decided...

600
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,440
not to take action over
the allegations Thomas
has made against me

601
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,800
because you believe them
to be untrue.

602
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,040
That is correct. And you are right.
There is no truth in them.

603
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,360
But, if you were to proceed with
the matter, you would find
them to be proven.

604
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,840
Thomas has tried to convince you
that I am a drunkard and a thief.

605
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Which we never believed.
Because you know no different.

606
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,040
Until a couple of years ago,
I was a drunkard.

607
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,640
And I was imprisoned...as a thief.

608
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
I have...

609
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,320
repaid your kindness...very poorly.

610
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,960
I masqueraded as a man of...honour.

611
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
And integrity.

612
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,040
But, by any moral code...

613
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,280
I am disgraced.

614
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,000
That can't be the whole story.

615
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,360
Perhaps not.
But it's enough of it to demand...

616
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,040
..my resignation.

617
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,760
Do you want to leave, Mr Bates?

618
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,240
No. But I feel I have no choice.

619
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,480
You owe me a say in the matter,
surely?

620
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,680
If you wish.

621
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,880
Then I will consider the case

622
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,800
and give you my decision when I have
discussed it with His Lordship.

623
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,800
Until then, I hope
you will remain in your post.

624
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,000
Thank you for
coming to Sybil's rescue.

625
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,200
You were very brave.

626
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,160
She told me you knocked a man down.

627
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,920
I hope I did my duty.

628
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,800
Are you a creature of duty?

629
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,120
Not entirely.

630
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,400
When you laugh with me or...
flirt with me...

631
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,360
is that a duty?

632
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,120
Are you conforming
to the fitness of things?

633
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,000
Doing what's expected?

634
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,120
Don't play with me.

635
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,600
I don't deserve it. Not from you.

636
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,040
You must be careful
not to break Sybil's heart.

637
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,320
I think she has a crush on you.

638
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,760
Well, that's something
no-one could accuse you of.

639
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,640
Oh, I don't know.

640
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,800
I assume you speak
in a spirit of mockery.

641
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,840
You should have more faith.

642
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,040
Shall I remind you
of some of the choicest remarks

643
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,800
you made about me
when I arrived here?

644
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,360
Because they live in my memory.

645
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,360
As fresh as the day
they were spoken.

646
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,800
Oh, Matthew.
What am I always telling you?

647
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,440
You must pay no attention
to the things I say.

648
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,120
Mr Bates.
Anna.

649
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,120
Will you really leave?

650
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,480
I doubt His Lordship
wants a thief in the house.

651
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,120
Now, go to sleep...
and dream of a better man.

652
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,000
I can't.

653
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,000
Because there isn't one.

654
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,360
(DOOR BANGS
AND BOTTLES RATTLE IN A CRATE)

655
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,400
Has Matthew gone?
Yes.

656
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,560
Thank the Lord he was there.

657
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,920
I hope you thanked Matthew properly.

658
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,800
I got them to make him
some sandwiches.

659
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,600
That's not quite what I meant.

660
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,360
And he asked me to marry him.

661
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,000
Heavens! What did they
put in them (?) I'm serious.

662
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,080
He proposed to me.

663
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh, my dear!

664
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,720
Have you given him an answer?

665
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,760
Only that I'd think about it.

666
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,680
Well...

667
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,480
That's an advance on what
it would've been a year ago.

668
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,840
Do you want to marry him?
I know you want me to marry him.

669
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
What we want doesn't matter.

670
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,640
At least, it's not all that matters.

671
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,200
Do you love Matthew?

672
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,960
Yes.

673
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,840
I think perhaps I do.

674
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,560
I think I may have loved him
for much longer than I knew.

675
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,120
Oh, my darling!

676
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,240
Let's not pretend this isn't the
answer to every one of our prayers.

677
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,000
I'd have to tell him.

678
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,840
Oh.

679
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,520
Is it absolutely necessary?

680
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,920
If I didn't, I'd feel as if
I'd caught him with a lie.

681
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,280
I hope you know that really smart
people sleep in separate rooms.

682
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,760
I always keep the bed made up
in the dressing room.

683
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,280
So at least I pretend
we sleep apart. Isn't that enough?

684
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,360
No. Never mind.

685
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,280
Goodnight.

686
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,320
Oh. Haven't you gone up yet?

687
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,840
Blow this out. You're the last.

688
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,720
Goodnight.
Goodnight.

689
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,600
Goodnight.

690
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,160
I'm gonna bloody get him.
I don't care what you say.

691
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,120
What would I say?
Everything comes to him who waits.

692
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,000
And I've waited long enough.

693
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,280
Does Carson know you're here?
I heard you were going out.

694
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,760
I wanted to see how he was walking.
Lynch is happy for me to ride him.

695
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Oh, yes. He's better.
But I'll wait and see what he's
like when you're up.

696
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,000
William, are you planning
to go home soon?

697
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,520
Well, it's a bit far
for my half day.

698
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,920
But I can maybe get the time in
July, when the family's in London.

699
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,680
That's if I don't go with you,
of course.

700
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,360
I think you should take a few
days off and go now. I'll fix it.

701
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,720
I'll speak to Father and to Carson.
No-one will mind.

702
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,600
But why, My Lady?

703
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,320
Your mother's not been well.

704
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,720
How do you know?
I heard someone mention it
in the village. I forget who.

705
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,600
I had a letter, and she never said.

706
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,640
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.

707
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
I know it will cheer her to see you.

708
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,280
Well...if it wouldn't be a bother.

709
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,280
It won't. I'll arrange it
as soon as I get back.

710
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,680
Thank you very much, My Lady.

711
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,880
She ought to spend some time
with the people she loves.

712
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,040
The Dowager Countess, My Lady.

713
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,680
Good afternoon, my dear.

714
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,120
Good afternoon.

715
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,760
There's no need to be so prim.
I come in peace.

716
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,720
Shall I sit here?

717
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,280
Now, I've been thinking.

718
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,520
I confess I do not know

719
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,600
if I would have had the strength,
mentally or physically...

720
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,120
..to carry a corpse...

721
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,000
the length of this house.

722
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,640
But I hope I would've done.

723
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,280
You were quite right.

724
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,720
When something bad happens...

725
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,280
there's no point
in wishing it had not happened.

726
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,080
The only option
is to minimise the damage.

727
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,920
Or try to.

728
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,120
But if the Flintshires
have got hold of it -

729
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,080
I've written to Susan.

730
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,200
I said it was a story

731
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,920
made up by Mr Pamuk's enemies

732
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,040
to discredit him.

733
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,720
Even if she doesn't believe me,
she won't tell,

734
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,440
in case it reflects badly on her.

735
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,160
The ambassador...is dangerous.

736
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,440
But then...how many people

737
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,520
really go to the Turkish Embassy?

738
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,560
It only takes one.

739
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,320
Well...

740
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,280
That just can't be helped.

741
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,360
We can't have him assassinated...

742
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,440
I suppose.

743
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,960
Robert still doesn't suspect.

744
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,120
Oh, I should hope not.
No. Our only way forward...

745
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,280
is to get Mary settled
as soon as possible.

746
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,640
I have news on that score.

747
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,800
Matthew has proposed.
(GASPS) My, my!

748
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,400
Has she said yes?
She hasn't said anything yet,

749
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,440
except that she's going to have to
tell him about Pamuk.

750
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,240
For heaven's sake! Why?

751
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,880
She thinks to keep it secret
would be dishonourable.

752
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,960
She reads too many novels.

753
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,280
I mean, one way or another,
everyone goes down the aisle

754
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
with half the story hidden.

755
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,280
The question is...

756
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,720
will she accept Matthew?

757
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,400
I'm not sure.

758
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,880
Well, if she doesn't,
we'll just have to take her abroad.

759
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,120
In these moments...

760
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,440
you can normally find an Italian
who isn't too picky.

761
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,920
We'll give her till the start
of the grouse. Very well.

762
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,560
If she turns Matthew down, we'll
take her to Rome in the autumn.

763
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,480
It's official.

764
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,160
Thank you for
not turning against her.

765
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,760
I know that you have rules and,
when people break them,
you find it hard to forgive.

766
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,920
I understand that...

767
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,840
and I respect it.

768
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,720
In this case,
Mary has the trump card.

769
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,080
What?

770
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,960
Mary is family.

771
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,120
Unusual, obviously.

772
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,040
Unusual? It's biblical.

773
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,400
Not quite.

774
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,280
If she won't say yes

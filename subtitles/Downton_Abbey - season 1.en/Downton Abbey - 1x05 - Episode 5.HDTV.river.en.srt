1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,385
You made me jump.

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,180
Daisy, what is the matter with you?
You're all thumbs.

3
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:51,757
- Sorry. I hate this room.
- Why?

4
00:00:51,762 --> 00:00:53,900
What's the matter with it?

5
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,540
Daisy?

6
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,500
Who's that from, Papa?
You seem very absorbed.

7
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:31,100
- Your Aunt Rosamond.
- Anything interesting?

8
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:33,245
Nothing to trouble you with.

9
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,260
Poor Aunt Rosamond.
All alone in that big house.

10
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:38,625
- I feel so sorry for her.
- I don't.

11
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,860
All alone, with plenty of money,
in a house in Eaton Square?

12
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:44,025
I can't imagine anything better.

13
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,505
Really, Mary, I wish
you wouldn't talk like that.

14
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,900
There will come a day when someone
thinks you mean what you say.

15
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:53,097
It can't come soon enough for me.

16
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,625
Carson, I'll be in the library.

17
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,745
Will you let me know
when Her Ladyship is down?

18
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,360
- Certainly, milord.
- Sybil, darling, this one's for you.

19
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,140
I saw another opening for
a secretary and I applied.

20
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:11,025
But you never said.

21
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,820
I didn't want you
to be disappointed.

22
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:14,625
I thought you'd given up.

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,900
I'll never give up
and nor will you.

24
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,977
Things are changing for women.

25
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:21,416
Not just the vote, but our lives.

26
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,785
But it's tomorrow!
At ten o clock.

27
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,300
Last time we waited for weeks
and weeks, and this one's tomorrow!

28
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:30,440
Then we must be ready by tomorrow,
mustn't we?

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,945
I thought I'd write to Edith

30
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,545
- to settle our promised church visit.
- If you want.

31
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,860
We can't throw her over, when she
made such effort for the last one.

32
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,117
- It's all in your head.
- I don't think so.

33
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:44,305
Then she's barking
up the wrong tree.

34
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,865
Poor Edith. I hope there's
a right tree for her somewhere.

35
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,825
Ma'am, I was wondering if I might
take some time this afternoon
to help in the village hall.

36
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,980
- Why? What's happening?
- It's the flower show, sir, next Saturday.

37
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:58,100
        - I'll give my father a hand
      with his stall, if I may.
     - Of course you must go.

38
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,740
And so, I'm afraid, must I.

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,985
Is Mr Carson about?

40
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,460
I don't think so.
I was just looking for him, myself.

41
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,065
Busy?

42
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm just trying to sort out
the wretched flower show.

43
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,545
I've had a letter from Rosamond.
Don't tell me:

44
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,860
she wants saddle of lamb and all the
fruit and vegetables we can muster.

45
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,777
She enjoys a taste of her old home.

46
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:44,660
She enjoys not paying for food.

47
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:46,585
There's something else.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,500
Apparently, the word is going round
London that Evelyn Napier

49
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:51,425
has given up any thought of Mary.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,280
That he's going to marry
one of the Semphill girls.

51
00:03:54,315 --> 00:03:58,127
She writes as if, somehow,
it reflects badly on Mary.

52
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:01,940
Your dear sister is always
such a harbinger of joy. No...

53
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,385
as if...

54
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,220
as if Mary had somehow been found
wanting in her character.

55
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,977
Well, I don't believe Mr Napier
would have said that.

56
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:13,700
Neither do I, really, but -
She ought to be married.

57
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,905
Talk to her.

58
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,545
She never listens to me.

59
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,740
If she did, she'd marry Matthew.

60
00:04:19,775 --> 00:04:21,865
What about Anthony Strallan?

61
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,865
Anthony Strallan is at least my age
and as dull as paint.

62
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,220
I doubt she'd want to sit next to
him at dinner, let alone marry him.

63
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:31,345
She has to marry someone, Robert.

64
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,140
And if this is what's being said
in London, she has to marry soon.

65
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,705
You shouldn't do that in here.

66
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,145
I don't like being in the pantry
all alone.

67
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,420
Mr Carson won't mind.
He's gone into the village.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,585
He'll mind if I tell him.

69
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,840
That's pretty.
Do you think so?

70
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,025
She wants it put onto a new shirt,

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,580
but it's a bit old-fashioned
to my taste. Oh, no, it's lovely.

72
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,860
Have you recovered, Daisy?

73
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,500
What from?
She had a bit of a turn.

74
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,665
When we were in Lady Mary's room.

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,945
I'm fine, thank you.
What sort of a turn?

76
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,500
Did you see a ghost? Leave her, if
she doesn't want to talk about it.

77
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:17,780
I've often wondered if this place
is haunted. It ought to be.

78
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:20,780
By the spirits of maids and footmen
who died in slavery?

79
00:05:20,815 --> 00:05:22,700
But not, in Thomas's case,
from over work.

80
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,580
Come on, Daisy. What was it?

81
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,745
I don't know. I was thinking...

82
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,660
first we had the Titanic -
Don't keep harping back to that.

83
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:43,197
I know it was a while ago,
but we knew 'em.

84
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:45,665
I think of how I laid the fires
for Mr Patrick,

85
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,700
but he drowned in them icy waters.
Oh, for God's sake.

86
00:05:49,735 --> 00:05:51,785
And then there's the Turkish
gentleman.

87
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,420
It just seems there's been
too much death in the house.

88
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,540
What's that got to do
with Lady Mary's bedroom?

89
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:00,500
Nothing. Nothing at all.

90
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,505
Afternoon, ma'am.

91
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,700
When do you put that magnificent
display of prizes on show?

92
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:19,425
Not till the day itself.

93
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,665
I remember a superb cup
from last year.

94
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,660
The Grantham Cup. It was donated
by the late Lord Grantham.

95
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:27,460
For the Best Bloom In The Village.
And who won it?

96
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,060
I did.

97
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,980
Well done.

98
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,905
And the year before?

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,100
Her Ladyship won that one, too.

100
00:06:38,135 --> 00:06:41,020
Heavens, how thrilling.

101
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:42,905
And before that?

102
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,060
You've met my father.

103
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,660
Good afternoon, Mr Molesley.
What are you showing this year?

104
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:52,065
Oh, this and that.

105
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
Only the finest roses in the
village. Really?

106
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,825
What an achievement.

107
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,460
It's a wonderful area for roses.

108
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,465
We're very lucky.

109
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,660
We'll see some beautiful examples
across the show.

110
00:07:03,695 --> 00:07:05,345
Won't we, Mr Molesley?

111
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,020
If you say so, Your Ladyship.

112
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,820
What's up with you?

113
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,785
Nothing.

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,300
His Lordship blames Mr Napier for
spreading gossip about Lady Mary,

115
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:32,260
but it was you, wasn't it?
Why do you say that?

116
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:34,185
Because Napier wasn't in on it.

117
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,300
Only four people know
he was in her room that night.

118
00:07:37,335 --> 00:07:39,397
You, me, Lady Mary
and possibly Daisy.

119
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,386
And I haven't said nothing
to nobody.

120
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,305
I didn't tell about Pamuk.
I just wrote

121
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,465
that Lady Mary was no better
than she ought to be.

122
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Who did you write it to? A friend
of mine. Valet to Lord Savident.

123
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,425
You know what they say
about old Savident.

124
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,500
Not so much an open mind as an open
mouth. No wonder it's round London.

125
00:07:53,535 --> 00:07:56,420
You won't tell, will you?
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

126
00:07:56,455 --> 00:07:58,305
Why? What's happened?

127
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,220
Mr Bates saw me nicking
a bottle of wine.

128
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,145
Has he told Mr Carson?
Not yet.

129
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,145
But he will
when he's feeling spiteful.

130
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,780
I wish we could be shot of him.
Then think of something quick.

131
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,380
Turn the tables on him, before
he has the chance to nail you.

132
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,180
I thought you went to bed hours ago.
I was writing a note for Lynch.

133
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:19,220
I need the governess cart tomorrow.

134
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,545
Oh?
I'm going to Malton.

135
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,425
Oh, don't risk the traffic
in Malton.

136
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,825
Not now every Tom, Dick and Harry
seems to have a motor.

137
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,460
Hardly. Last time, there were five
cars parked in the market place

138
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,825
and another three drove past
while I was waiting.

139
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,540
Get Branson to take you in the car.
Neither of us are using it.

140
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:37,180
I thought I'd pop in
on old Mrs Stuart.

141
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:39,660
Will you tell Mama, if I forget?

142
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,945
You're late this morning.

143
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,260
The library grate needed
a real going over.

144
00:08:53,295 --> 00:08:55,425
Are any of them down yet?

145
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,580
Lady Sybil's in the dining room.
I'll start with her room, then.

146
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:00,105
Daisy?

147
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,780
You know when you were talking about
the feeling of death in the house?

148
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:05,745
I was just being silly.

149
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,185
I found myself wondering
about the connection

150
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,300
between the poor Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk, and Lady Mary's room.

151
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:17,180
Only you were saying how you felt
so uncomfortable in there.

152
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,425
Well, I've...

153
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,540
I've got to get on.
I'm late enough as it is.

154
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,020
Hello.

155
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,880
Is everything all right?
Oh, hello.

156
00:09:43,915 --> 00:09:46,020
I am about to send a telegram.
Oh.

157
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,985
Papa's sister is always nagging him
to send supplies to London

158
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,740
and then we cable her, so her butler
can be at King's Cross to meet them.

159
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:59,180
It's idiotic, really.
Is this Lady Rosamond Painswick?

160
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,105
You HAVE done your homework.

161
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,905
She wrote to welcome me
into the family,

162
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,820
which I thought pretty generous
given the circumstances.

163
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,700
It's easy to be generous
when you have nothing to lose.

164
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,980
So are you doing any more
church visiting with Edith?

165
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,065
My mother's trying
to set something up.

166
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,520
Well, watch out.
I think she has big plans for you.

167
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,940
Then she's in for an equally
big disappointment.

168
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,945
Is it all right to do the fire?

169
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,345
Why are you so late?
I went back to my room

170
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,740
after I'd woken everyone, and I
just shut my eyes for a moment.

171
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:39,837
I've been trying
to catch up ever since.

172
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,900
Have you had any breakfast?
Not a crumb.

173
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:43,865
Here.

174
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,585
You can't take her biscuits.

175
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,705
She never eats them. None of them do.

176
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,460
They're just thrown away and changed
every evening. Thanks.

177
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,300
She won't mind anyway.
She's nice, Lady Sybil.

178
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,020
Ugh.

179
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,940
Gwen?

180
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,620
May I ask why you are sitting
on Lady Sybil's bed?

181
00:11:06,655 --> 00:11:09,305
Well, you see, I had a turn.

182
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,780
Like a burst of sickness.
Just sudden, like.

183
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:15,265
I had to sit down.
It's true.

184
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,060
You'd better go and lie down.
I will tell Mrs Hughes.

185
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,945
I don't need to interrupt
her morning.

186
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,945
I'm sure I'll be fine,
if I could just put my feet up.

187
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,740
And how many bedrooms have you still
got to do? Just one. Lady Edith's.

188
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,545
And you can manage on your own?

189
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,060
Well, she's no use to man or beast
in that state. Go on.

190
00:11:32,095 --> 00:11:33,580
Shoo.

191
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:42,100
Daisy, may I ask why you are holding
Lady Sybil's biscuit jar?

192
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,900
I was just polishing it
before I put it back.

193
00:11:47,935 --> 00:11:49,900
See that you do.

194
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm sorry, milady,
but I can't do more than my best.

195
00:12:01,135 --> 00:12:03,545
Is there some difficulty,
Your Ladyship?

196
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,620
Dear Mrs Hughes, as you know
we're giving a dinner on Friday

197
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:09,905
for Sir Anthony Strallan?
Yes, milady.

198
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,420
It seems he is particularly fond
of a new pudding.

199
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,900
It's called Apple Charlotte.
Do you know it?

200
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,625
I'm not sure.

201
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,780
His sister, Mrs Chetwood,
sent me the receipt.

202
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:21,900
I'm trying to persuade Mrs Patmore
to make it.

203
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:23,785
And I'm trying to persuade
Her Ladyship

204
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,020
that I have planned the dinner
with her and I can't change it now.

205
00:12:27,055 --> 00:12:30,237
Why not? Because everything's
been ordered and prepared.

206
00:12:30,272 --> 00:12:33,420
Well, there's nothing here
that looks very complicated.

207
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,345
Apples, lemons, butter...

208
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,740
I cannot work from a new receipt
at a moment's notice!

209
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,620
But I can read it to you,
if that's the problem.

210
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:43,145
Problem? Who mentioned a problem?

211
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,945
How dare you say such a thing
in front of Her Ladyship!

212
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,300
Very well. We'll try it another time
when you've had longer to prepare.

213
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:52,140
We'll stay
with the raspberry meringue.

214
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,300
And very nice it'll be, too.

215
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,420
I'm sure.

216
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,980
Have you taken leave of your senses?

217
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:03,437
I'm so sorry about that, milady.

218
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:05,860
Never mind. I was asking a lot.

219
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:08,305
Do look after that girl.

220
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,185
Daisy? She's used to it.
She'll be all right.

221
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,020
I wonder. Mrs Patmore looks ready
to eat her alive.

222
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,025
I was only trying to help.

223
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,300
Like Judas was only trying to help,
I suppose,

224
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:21,540
when he brought the Roman soldiers
to the garden!

225
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,500
I had to let the skirt down
a little, but I can put it back.

226
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:42,505
No, it's yours.

227
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:45,100
What will happen if one of the maids
finds your room empty?

228
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:47,500
It'd only be Anna
and she wouldn't give me away.

229
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,620
She's like a sister.
She'd never betray me.

230
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,500
Then she's not like my sisters.

231
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,180
Walk on.

232
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,345
Shall I give you a hand?

233
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,100
Ah, would you?
It takes half the time with two.

234
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,620
I always feel a bit sorry
for Lady Edith.

235
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:12,025
Me too. Although I don't know why.

236
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,225
When you think what she's got
and we haven't.

237
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,860
Mrs Hughes said she was after
the other heir, Mr Patrick Crawley.

238
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,700
The one who drowned.
That was different.

239
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,705
She was in love with him.

240
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,760
What happened?
She never got a look-in.

241
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:25,745
He was all set up to marry Lady Mary.

242
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,260
Then he's a braver man than I am,
Gunga Din.

243
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,545
Sad to think about.

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,980
It's always sad when you love someone
who doesn't love you back.

245
00:14:37,015 --> 00:14:38,940
No matter who you are.

246
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,220
No, I mean it's sad that he died.

247
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,137
Oh.

248
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:46,985
Yes.

249
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,140
Very sad.

250
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,225
He was nice.

251
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,265
Well, thank you for that.

252
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,745
Much appreciated.
My pleasure.

253
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,140
Perhaps Mr Patrick did love her
back, he just couldn't say.

254
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,745
Why ever not?

255
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,780
Sometimes we're not at liberty
to speak.

256
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,260
Sometimes it wouldn't be right.

257
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,180
Take a seat.

258
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,145
The flower show?

259
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,940
Oh, I thought I was in for another
telling off about the hospital.

260
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:04,625
No, this time it's the flower show.

261
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,065
I've been to see
old Mr Molesley's garden

262
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,220
and his roses are the most beautiful
I've ever laid eyes on.

263
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:12,825
Go on.

264
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,825
You may not know it, but I believe
the committee feel obliged

265
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,940
to give you the cup for the Best
Bloom as a kind of local tradition.

266
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,545
No. No, I do not know that.

267
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,300
I thought I usually won the prize
for Best Bloom In The Village

268
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:29,020
because my gardener had grown
the best bloom in the village.

269
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:32,580
Yes, but you don't USUALLY win,
do you?

270
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:34,340
You always win.

271
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,265
Yes. I have been very fortunate
in that regard.

272
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,860
But, surely, when Mr Molesley's
garden is so remarkable

273
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:45,580
and he is so very proud
of his roses -

274
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:48,317
You talk of Mr Molesley's pride.

275
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,985
What about my gardener's pride?

276
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,580
Is he to be sacrificed on the altar
of Molesley's ambition?

277
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,860
All I'm asking is
that you release them

278
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,345
from any obligation to let you win.

279
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,220
Why not just tell them to choose
whichever flower is best?

280
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:05,060
But that is precisely
what they already know.

281
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:07,060
And do!

282
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,700
I'm sorry, milord.
I didn't think you'd be in here.

283
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,940
Are my eyes deceiving me
or is one of these missing?

284
00:17:27,975 --> 00:17:29,980
I don't know them well enough.

285
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,985
No. Why would you?

286
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,040
But there's a very pretty
little blue one

287
00:17:34,075 --> 00:17:36,025
with a miniature framed
in French paste.

288
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,500
It was made for a German prince.
I forget who...

289
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,580
Unless it's been moved
for some reason.

290
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,900
But why would it be?

291
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,665
Can you help.
I shall be so grateful.

292
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,180
Our horse has cast a shoe.
Is there a smithy nearby?

293
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,340
Aye, you can try old Crump
in the next village.

294
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,985
Thank you.

295
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,905
You see? Help's at hand.

296
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,780
At least it happened
on the way home.

297
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,837
Well, they'll be worried about you.

298
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:13,860
And if they check on me,
I'm finished.

299
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,100
Is Her Ladyship wearing that now?

300
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:19,905
This is for Friday night.

301
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,020
I thought I'd give it a press
while I had time.

302
00:18:22,055 --> 00:18:24,025
Do you know what's happened
to Lady Sybil?

303
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,780
The others' changes are ready,
but there's no sign of her.

304
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:30,037
Don't you start. I've had Her
Majesty on at me all afternoon.

305
00:18:30,072 --> 00:18:33,225
Mr Carson says he'll fetch the
police if she's not back soon.

306
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,340
Sorry, Miss, but Mr Crump's staying
over at the Skelton estate tonight.

307
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,580
He's working there all week.
Is there anyone else?

308
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:40,420
Not that I know of.

309
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,700
Come on Dragon. Come on!

310
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,900
Dragon, if you don't move now,
I'll have you boiled for glue!

311
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,345
What if she's overturned?

312
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,545
What if she's lying in a ditch
somewhere?

313
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,065
I'm sure she'll be back
in the shake of a lamb's tail.

314
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,780
The truth is they're all getting
too old for a mother's control.

315
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:20,117
They're growing up.
They've grown up.

316
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,126
They need their own establishments.

317
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm sure they'll get plenty
of offers.

318
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:28,980
No-one ever warns you about bringing
up daughters.

319
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:31,105
You think it's going
to be like Little Women.

320
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,100
Instead they're at each other's
throats from dawn till dusk.

321
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,180
You look done in.

322
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,260
I'll bring you some food up later
when we've finished dinner.

323
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,340
Where were you?

324
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,705
You came up, then?

325
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,820
Of course I did.
I had to change for the afternoon.

326
00:19:56,855 --> 00:19:59,380
Did you cover for me?
What do you think?

327
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,180
I don't suppose this had anything
to do with Lady Sybil.

328
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:07,425
Oh, Anna, it was a nightmare.

329
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,880
I don't know how I got in
without being seen.

330
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,300
I'm sure I left a trail of mud
up the stairs.

331
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,380
So...did you get the job?

332
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,020
Well, we'll have to wait and see.

333
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,985
Sorry to bother you, milady,

334
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,865
but your mother wanted you
to know Lady Sybil's back.

335
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,300
She's changing now, so dinner won't
be late, after all. What happened?

336
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:40,060
The horse went lame.

337
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,260
Is there anything else?

338
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,020
There is something
that's been troubling me.

339
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,580
You remember the Turkish gentleman,
Mr Pamuk?

340
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:56,417
The one who died all sudden, like.

341
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:58,220
Of course I remember.
Well...

342
00:20:58,255 --> 00:21:00,180
it's Daisy, milady.

343
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,945
The kitchen maid.

344
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,665
Only she's been talking recently

345
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,460
as if she had ideas
about Mr Pamuk's death.

346
00:21:08,495 --> 00:21:11,065
What sort of ideas?

347
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,225
Well, I've no proof
and maybe I'm wrong.

348
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,100
But I've a sense she knows
something, but won't say what.

349
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,780
Something involving Lady Mary.

350
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,640
Well, how absurd.

351
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:28,905
What could she know?

352
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,420
Whatever it is, she won't say.
Not to us, anyway.

353
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,940
Have you spoken to Lady Mary
about this?

354
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,945
I didn't like to, milady.

355
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,185
It seemed impertinent somehow.

356
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,700
But I thought someone in the family
ought to know about it.

357
00:21:44,735 --> 00:21:46,420
Quite right.

358
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,980
Bring the girl to my room...
tomorrow. After breakfast.

359
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,740
What did she want?

360
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:04,425
Nothing.

361
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,380
Just a message from Mama to say
that Sybil had turned up alive.

362
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:09,180
Poor darling.

363
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,545
She had to walk for miles.

364
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,020
I don't think I'd have got down,
however lame the horse.

365
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:16,425
No.

366
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't believe you would.

367
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,825
I couldn't say, milady.

368
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,780
I don't know
what Miss O'Brien means.

369
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:38,420
I didn't see nothing.

370
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,345
Well, not much.

371
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,300
O'Brien,
I wonder if you might leave us?

372
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,580
Now...it's Daisy, isn't it?

373
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,220
Yes, milady.

374
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm sure you see O'Brien only acted
as she did because she is concerned.

375
00:23:05,455 --> 00:23:07,425
I suppose so, milady.

376
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,700
She seems to think that you are
in possession of some knowledge

377
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,500
that is uncomfortable for you.

378
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,180
Because if that is the case,
then I don't think it fair on you.

379
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,660
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

380
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,820
My dear, my heart goes out to you.
It really does.

381
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,180
Oh, there, there.

382
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:39,020
You've been carrying too heavy
a burden for too long.

383
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,580
Just tell me...

384
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,620
..and I promise you'll feel better.

385
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,545
You seem well prepared.

386
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,540
They'll add a few more flowers
before we open in the morning,

387
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,677
but I think we're nearly there.

388
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,780
Do look at Mr Molesley's display.

389
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:08,460
He's worked so hard.

390
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,940
They're rather marvellous,
aren't they?

391
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,545
Lovely.

392
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,500
Well done, Mr Molesley.
Thank you, milady.

393
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:19,420
I think everyone
is to be congratulated.

394
00:24:19,455 --> 00:24:21,465
It's splendid.

395
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,785
But do look at these roses.
Have you ever seen the like?

396
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,700
My dear, Mrs Crawley believes I am
profiting from an unfair advantage.

397
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:30,065
Oh?

398
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,300
She feels in the past
I have been given the cup

399
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:34,465
merely as a matter of routine
rather than merit.

400
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,900
Rather ungallant, Mother. I'm sure
when we see Cousin Violet's roses,

401
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,020
it will be hard to think
they could be bettered.

402
00:24:40,055 --> 00:24:41,940
Hard, but not impossible.

403
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,385
You are quite wonderful

404
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,500
the way you see room for improvement
wherever you look.

405
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,420
I never knew such reforming zeal.

406
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:54,740
I take that as a compliment.

407
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,460
I must have said it wrong.

408
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,505
Poor Granny.
She's not used to being challenged.

409
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,940
Nor is Mother. I think we should
let them settle it between them.

410
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,880
So are you interested in flowers?

411
00:25:13,915 --> 00:25:16,185
I'm interested in the village.

412
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,180
In fact, I'm on my way
to inspect the cottages.

413
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,680
You know what all work and no play
did for Jack.

414
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:24,020
But you think I'm a dull boy,
anyway, don't you?

415
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,740
I play, too.
I'm coming up for dinner tonight.

416
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:30,060
I suspect I'm there
to balance the numbers.

417
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,420
Is it in aid of anything?

418
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,425
Not that I know of.

419
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,780
Just a couple of dreary neighbours,
that's all.

420
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:38,780
Maybe I'll shine by comparison.

421
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:40,940
Mary, we're going.

422
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,700
Maybe you will.

423
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,020
Might I have a word?

424
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,060
I want to say something
before I ring the gong.

425
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:05,545
I'm afraid it's not very pleasant.

426
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,225
His Lordship is missing
a very valuable snuff box.

427
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,820
It appears to have been taken
from the case in his room.

428
00:26:12,855 --> 00:26:15,060
If one of you knows
anything about this,

429
00:26:15,095 --> 00:26:17,785
will he or she please come to me?

430
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,260
Your words will be heard
in the strictest confidence.

431
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,700
Thank you.

432
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,460
I am sorry, Mr Bates.

433
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,620
What an unpleasant thing
to have happened.

434
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:38,745
Why are you picking on him?

435
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,980
Because he's the only one of us
who goes in there.

436
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:42,780
But don't worry.
I'm sure it'll turn up.

437
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:44,980
Thank you for your concern.

438
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,540
I hate this kind of thing.

439
00:26:54,575 --> 00:26:56,780
I hope to God they find it.

440
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,020
Better get a move on.

441
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,660
I'm coming.

442
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,545
Does this brooch work?

443
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,780
I can't decide.
It's charming.

444
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,345
Oh, dear. Is it another scolding?

445
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,940
Of course not. You're too grown up
to scold these days.

446
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:30,705
Heavens.

447
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,660
Then it's really serious.

448
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,700
I'd like you to look after
Sir Anthony Strallan tonight.

449
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:40,025
He's a nice, decent man.

450
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,505
His position may not be quite
like Papa's,

451
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,300
but it would still make you a force
for good in the county.

452
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:47,877
Mama, not again.
How many times am I to be ordered

453
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:50,420
to marry the man sitting next to me
at dinner?

454
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:52,397
As many times as it takes.

455
00:27:52,432 --> 00:27:54,305
I turned down Matthew Crawley.

456
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,100
Is it likely I'd marry Strallan
when I wouldn't marry him?

457
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,860
I am glad you've come to think
more highly of Cousin Matthew.

458
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,105
That's not the point.
No.

459
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,585
The point is
when you refused Matthew,

460
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,780
you were the daughter of an Earl
with an unsullied reputation.

461
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:12,340
Now you are damaged goods.

462
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:13,945
Mama...

463
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,900
Somehow, there is a rumour in
London, that you are not virtuous.

464
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,320
What? Does Papa know about this?

465
00:28:21,355 --> 00:28:23,825
He knows it and he dismisses it

466
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,420
because, unlike you and me,
he does not know that it is true.

467
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,480
Let's hope it's just unkind gossip.

468
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:36,820
Because if anyone heard about...

469
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,505
Kemal.

470
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,820
My lover. Kemal Pamuk.

471
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,505
Exactly.

472
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,120
If it gets around,
and you're not already married,

473
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:50,700
every door in London
will be slammed in your face.

474
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:53,420
Mama, the world is changing.

475
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:55,505
Not that much...

476
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,740
and not fast enough for you.

477
00:28:57,775 --> 00:28:59,940
I know you mean to help.

478
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:01,545
I know you love me.

479
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,705
But I also know what I'm capable of,

480
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,380
and forty years of boredom and duty
just isn't possible for me.

481
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:09,545
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,300
I do love you...

483
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,140
and I want to help.

484
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,945
I'm a lost cause, Mama.

485
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,580
Leave me to manage my own affairs.

486
00:29:18,615 --> 00:29:21,185
Why not concentrate on Edith?

487
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,740
She needs all the help she can get.

488
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,220
You mustn't be unkind to Edith.
She has fewer advantages than you.

489
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:30,745
Fewer?

490
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,380
She has none at all.

491
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,620
Open the oven.

492
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:53,225
What's happened?
It's that bloomin' Daisy!

493
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,420
I've said she'll be the death of me,
and now my word's come true!

494
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:58,860
Come and sit down.
Get away!

495
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:00,785
Get back to the stables!

496
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,220
What'll you serve now?
Them, of course.

497
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:05,425
I haven't got anything else.

498
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,140
Daisy, give us a hand,
get that cloth.

499
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,460
What's the matter with that?
Are you sure?

500
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:20,420
Shouldn't we tell?
Certainly not.

501
00:30:20,455 --> 00:30:22,305
Is the remove ready to go up?

502
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,260
Daisy, give him a hand
with the vegetables.

503
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,180
They're up in the servery
in the warmer.

504
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm glad I don't have to eat them.
What the eye can't see,

505
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:32,380
the heart won't grieve over.

506
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,185
There's no doubt about it.

507
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,740
The next few years in farming are
going to be about mechanisation.

508
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:46,140
That's the test
and we're going to have to meet it.

509
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:48,557
Don't you agree, Lady Mary?

510
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:50,940
Yes, of course, Sir Anthony.

511
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,580
I'm sure I do.

512
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,620
Are we ever going to be allowed
to turn?

513
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,980
Sir Anthony, it must be so hard to
meet the challenge of the future,

514
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:05,940
and yet be fair to your employees.

515
00:31:05,975 --> 00:31:08,505
That is the point precisely.

516
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,620
We can't fight progress, but we must
find ways to soften the blow.

517
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:15,020
I should love to see one
of the new harvesters,

518
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:16,817
if you would ever let me.

519
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,516
We don't have one here.

520
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:20,180
I shall be delighted.

521
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,500
I hope they find that snuff box.

522
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:30,025
What happens if they don't?

523
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:32,940
They'll organise a search,
won't they? I wouldn't be Mr Bates.

524
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,980
Not for all the tea in China.
Wouldn't you, Thomas?

525
00:31:36,015 --> 00:31:38,660
I dare say he feels
just the same about you.

526
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,300
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.

527
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,865
Just a minute!

528
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,160
I don't like to put it on earlier.

529
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:55,420
It sinks in and spoils the effect.

530
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,020
Mama has released me, thank God.

531
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,140
Sir Anthony seems nice enough.

532
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,660
If you want to talk farming
and foxes by the hour.

533
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm rather looking forward
to the flower show tomorrow.

534
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:18,185
Where Mr Molesley's roses
will turn everybody's heads.

535
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,820
But if you tell Granny I said so,
I'll denounce you as a liar.

536
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,665
I wouldn't dare.

537
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,580
I'll leave that
to my fearless mother.

538
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,100
How are the cottages? Coming on
wonderfully. I'd love to show you.

539
00:32:31,135 --> 00:32:33,220
Obviously,
it's an act of faith at this stage.

540
00:32:33,255 --> 00:32:34,825
Yes.

541
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,200
Good God!

542
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,460
What on earth...?
I do apologise, Lady Grantham.

543
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,420
But I had a mouthful of salt.
What?

544
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,940
Everyone! Put down your forks!

545
00:32:47,975 --> 00:32:50,945
Carson, remove this.

546
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Bring fruit, bring cheese, bring
anything to take this taste away!

547
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:57,505
Sir Anthony, I am so sorry.

548
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,100
Fains I be Mrs Patmore's kitchen
maid when the news gets out.

549
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:04,380
Poor girl. We ought to send in
a rescue party.

550
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:07,117
You must think us very disorganised.

551
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,820
No not at all. These things happen.

552
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,345
Hey, come on.

553
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,160
It's not that bad.

554
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:19,905
Nobody's died.

555
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,665
I don't understand it.

556
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,985
It must have been that Daisy.

557
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,900
She's muddled everything up
before now! But I never -

558
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,780
Don't worry, Daisy.
You're not in the line of fire.

559
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:32,945
I know that pudding!
I chose it cos I know it!

560
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,940
Which is why you wouldn't let Her
Ladyship have the pudding she wanted.

561
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:37,780
Because you didn't know it.

562
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,020
Exactly!

563
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,265
I don't see how it happened.

564
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,220
Come on, everyone. Let's give Mrs
Patmore some room to breathe.

565
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:53,145
You, too.

566
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,140
I don't think I should leave her.
Mr Carson knows what he's doing.

567
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,945
Don't do that.

568
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,420
Get William or the hall boy to
do it. It's beneath your dignity.

569
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:05,460
It won't kill me.

570
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,940
Now...

571
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
..all in your own good time.

572
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,300
I think you've got something
to tell me...

573
00:34:19,335 --> 00:34:21,180
haven't you?

574
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,100
I think I know
where that snuff box is.

575
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:32,865
Where?

576
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,785
Hidden in your room.

577
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,060
You don't think -
Of Course I don't.

578
00:34:37,095 --> 00:34:39,665
You silly beggar.

579
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,820
Then -? I bet Thomas would like it,
if they took you for a thief.

580
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,985
Yes. I expect he would.

581
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,225
Go upstairs now and find it.

582
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,300
And when you have, you can choose
whether to put it in Thomas's room.

583
00:34:52,335 --> 00:34:55,060
Or give it to me,
and I'll slip it into Miss O'Brien's.

584
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,905
You naughty girl.

585
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,580
Fight fire with fire.
That's what my Mum says.

586
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,740
Poor Mrs Patmore. Do you think you
should go down and see her?

587
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:11,300
Tomorrow. She needs time
to recover her nerves.

588
00:35:11,335 --> 00:35:13,745
I knew there was something going on.

589
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,020
It seems hard that poor Sir Anthony
had to pay the price.

590
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,460
Good God!

591
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,420
As for you giggling like
a schoolgirl with Cousin Matthew!

592
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,785
It was pathetic.

593
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,900
Poor Edith. I'm sorry Cousin Matthew
proved a disappointment to you.

594
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:31,340
Who says he has?

595
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,137
Matthew.

596
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,865
He told me.

597
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,505
Oh, sorry. Wasn't I supposed to know?

598
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,460
You were very helpful, Edith,
looking after Sir Anthony.

599
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:44,180
You saved the day.

600
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:46,225
I enjoyed it.

601
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,860
We seemed to have a lot
to talk about.

602
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,140
Spare me your boasting, please.

603
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:04,625
Now who's jealous?
Jealous?

604
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,740
Do you think I couldn't have
him if I wanted him?

605
00:36:06,775 --> 00:36:09,917
Even you can't take every prize.

606
00:36:09,952 --> 00:36:13,060
Is that a challenge?
If you like.

607
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,225
I could almost manage
for a long time,

608
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,580
knowing the kitchen
and where everything was kept.

609
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,105
Even with that fool girl.

610
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,900
I think you might owe Daisy
an apology.

611
00:36:28,935 --> 00:36:30,865
Maybe.

612
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,740
I've had a lot to put up with,
I can tell you.

613
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:36,385
And you've not been to a doctor?

614
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,340
I don't need a doctor
to tell me I'm going blind.

615
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,900
A blind cook, Mr Carson.

616
00:36:46,935 --> 00:36:48,945
What a joke.

617
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,060
Whoever heard of such a thing?

618
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,100
A blind cook.

619
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,660
I hope our salty pudding
didn't spoil the evening for you.

620
00:37:03,695 --> 00:37:05,585
On the contrary.

621
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,585
I'm glad you and Mary
are getting along.

622
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,145
There's no reason you can't be
friends. No reason at all.

623
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,820
I don't suppose there's any chance
that you could sort of start again?

624
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:16,340
Life is full of surprises.

625
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,865
Ah. I've been waiting for you.

626
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,700
I've found a book and it's just
the thing to catch your interest.

627
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:27,857
Oh, really?
I'm intrigued what could it be?

628
00:37:27,892 --> 00:37:29,945
Well I was looking in the library
and I...

629
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,820
I was very taken by what you were
saying over dinner about the -

630
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:35,917
You're so right, Lady Mary.
How clever you are.

631
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,980
This is exactly
what we have to be aware of.

632
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,380
There's a section here I was rather
unsure about. I wonder if you...

633
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,540
It seems we have both been thrown
over for a bigger prize.

634
00:37:52,575 --> 00:37:55,305
Heavens, is that the time?

635
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,540
You're not going?
The truth is my head's splitting.

636
00:37:58,575 --> 00:38:01,740
I don't want to spoil the party
so I'll slip away.

637
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,100
Would you make my excuses
to your parents?

638
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,980
Excuse me, Sir Anthony.

639
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,945
Has Mr Crawley left?
Yes, milady.

640
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,620
But what about the car? Branson can't
have brought it round so quickly.

641
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,460
He said he'd rather walk, milady.

642
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:29,060
Thank you.

643
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,260
Mary can be such a child.

644
00:38:32,295 --> 00:38:34,060
What do you mean, darling?

645
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,105
She thinks if you put a toy down,

646
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,980
it'll still be sitting there when
you want to play with it again.

647
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,140
What are you talking about?

648
00:38:47,175 --> 00:38:48,780
Never mind.

649
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,465
Mr Carson?

650
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,360
We were wondering
about that snuff box.

651
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:07,407
Has it turned up yet?
I'm afraid not.

652
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:10,385
Well, I think we should have
a search.

653
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,945
What? It doesn't do to leave these
things too long.

654
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,500
Mr Carson can search the men's rooms,
Mrs Hughes the women's.

655
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:20,740
And it should be right away,
now we've talked of it.

656
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,460
So no-one has a chance
to hide the box.

657
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:24,265
Don't you agree, Mr Carson?

658
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,145
Well, perhaps it's for the best.

659
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,780
Although I'm sure
I won't find anything.

660
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,980
I'll fetch Mrs Hughes.

661
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,820
I think I'll just um...
I'd better check it's tidy.

662
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,260
The bastard's hidden it in my room
or yours.

663
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,740
Why did I ever listen to you
in the first place?

664
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,180
Miss O'Brien?

665
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,940
My, my. You have been busy.

666
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,940
I was expecting you later than this.

667
00:40:03,975 --> 00:40:06,220
I'll tell Molesley to lock up.
Thanks.

668
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:07,860
Good night, Mother.

669
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,980
How was your evening?
Did you enjoy yourself?

670
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:14,945
Quite.

671
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,820
The thing is,
just for a moment I thought -

672
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,820
Never mind what I thought.
I was wrong.

673
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,620
Good night.

674
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:43,380
My word, Molesley, splendid roses.
Well done. Thank you, Your Lordship.

675
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,860
All the stalls are set out very well
this year.

676
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:47,945
This is enchanting.

677
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,940
Do we grow this? I doubt if you've
got that one, Your Ladyship.

678
00:40:50,975 --> 00:40:53,345
I've only just found it, myself.

679
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,340
Is it a secret?
Or could you tell Mr Brocket?

680
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:58,465
I'd be glad to, milady.

681
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,340
He should come and see the rose
garden. He could give us some ideas.

682
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,185
Old Molseley's a champion.

683
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,340
Or he would be, in a fairer world.

684
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,545
Don't you start.

685
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,540
I'm afraid I've been annoying
Cousin Violet on that score.

686
00:41:10,575 --> 00:41:13,260
If Molesley deserves the first prize
for his flowers

687
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:15,385
the judges will give it to him.

688
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,620
They wouldn't dare. Really, Robert.
You make me so annoyed.

689
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:20,945
Isn't it possible
I should win the thing on merit?

690
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,740
I think the appropriate answer
to that, Mama, is 'Yes, dear.'

691
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,505
I don't know why we're bothering.

692
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:30,420
We'll have missed the speeches
as it is.

693
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,225
Don't be such a grouch.

694
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,500
You should have punished one of them
at least.

695
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,140
They know that I know.
That's worth something.

696
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,820
What do you think will happen
to Mrs Patmore?

697
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,345
She'll muddle through
with Daisy for help.

698
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,660
In the long term, we'll have to wait
for the doctor to give his opinion.

699
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:52,660
I hope there's something they can do.

700
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:54,665
I hope so, too.

701
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,980
But if there isn't,
I hope they tell her there isn't.

702
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,420
Nothing is harder to live with
than false hope.

703
00:42:00,455 --> 00:42:03,140
I wish you'd just come out with it.

704
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,905
With what?

705
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,060
Whatever it is you're keeping secret.

706
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,820
I can't.

707
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,000
You don't deny it, then?

708
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:21,025
No, I don't deny it.

709
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,940
And I don't deny
you've a right to ask.

710
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,940
But I can't.

711
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,700
I'm not a free man.

712
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,465
Are you trying to tell me
that you're married?

713
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,820
I have been married, yes,
but that's not all of it.

714
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,860
Because...

715
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,145
..because I love you, Mr Bates.

716
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,220
I know it's not ladylike to say it...

717
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,620
..but I'm not a lady and I don't
pretend to be.

718
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,545
You are a lady to me.

719
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,180
And I never knew a finer one.

720
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,780
If you want a lift,
I can take one of you, but not more.

721
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,785
One of the women.

722
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,220
No, you must go. Then we can all
hurry and meet you there.

723
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:10,905
Yes all right.

724
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,985
I mustn't slow you down.

725
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,740
There's been too much of that
already.

726
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,700
Have you recovered from our ordeal?

727
00:43:39,735 --> 00:43:41,905
I got a letter this morning.

728
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,500
They must have written it as soon
as I left the office.

729
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,945
They are pleased to have met me,

730
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,320
but I do not quite fit
their requirements.

731
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:53,625
So it was all for nothing.
I don't agree.

732
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,185
Only a fool doesn't know
when they've been beaten.

733
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,820
Then I'm a fool, for I'm a long way
from being beaten yet.

734
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,785
And now...

735
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:08,860
When you ran off last night,
I hope you hadn't thought me rude.

736
00:44:08,895 --> 00:44:10,957
Certainly not.
I monopolised you at dinner.

737
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:12,985
I had no right
to any more of your time.

738
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,660
You see, Edith, and I had this sort
of bet - Please don't apologise.

739
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:20,060
I had a lovely evening and
I'm glad we're on speaking terms.

740
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,060
Now, I should look after my mother.

741
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:30,580
Why was Cousin Matthew
in such a hurry to get away?

742
00:44:30,615 --> 00:44:32,585
Don't be stupid.

743
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:35,060
I suppose you didn't want him
when he wanted you,

744
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:37,317
and now it's the other way round.

745
00:44:37,352 --> 00:44:39,505
You have to admit it's quite funny.

746
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,920
I'll admit that
if I ever wanted to attract a man,

747
00:44:41,955 --> 00:44:44,300
I'd steer clear of those clothes
and that hat.

748
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,660
You think yourself so superior,
don't you?

749
00:44:47,695 --> 00:44:49,500
Ugh!

750
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,060
Well, I think she who laughs last
laughs longest.

751
00:45:01,095 --> 00:45:03,180
Did that missing box of yours
ever turn up?

752
00:45:03,215 --> 00:45:05,145
It was a fuss about nothing.

753
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,540
They must have put it back
on the wrong shelf, dusting.

754
00:45:07,575 --> 00:45:09,465
Bates found it this morning.

755
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,540
Next time, have a proper look before
you start complaining.

756
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,740
I'm sure the servants were
frightened half to death.

757
00:45:14,775 --> 00:45:16,540
Mea Culpa.

758
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,500
And now the Grantham Cup for
the Best Bloom In The Village.

759
00:45:28,535 --> 00:45:31,700
And The Grantham Cup
is awarded to...

760
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,780
..Mr William Molesley...

761
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,740
..for his Comptesse Cabarousse rose.

762
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,580
Bravo! Well done!

763
00:45:56,615 --> 00:45:58,300
Bravo!

764
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,580
Congratulations, Mr Molesley.

765
00:46:09,615 --> 00:46:11,225
Thank you, milady.

766
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,225
Thank you for letting me have it.

767
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,980
It is the judge's who decide
these things, not me.

768
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:18,260
But very well done.

769
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,540
Congratulations.

770
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,825
Bravo, Mama.

771
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,420
That must have been a real
sacrifice. And bravely borne.

772
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,180
I don't know
what everyone's on about.

773
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:37,860
But I...
All is well, my dear.

774
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,660
All is well.

775
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,740
But you agree with everything
he says? I do, my dear.

776
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:17,625

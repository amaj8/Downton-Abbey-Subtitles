1
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Downton Abbey

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
season 1, episode 7

3
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,740
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,445
Come on, come on!
You should be done here!

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,220
They'll be back from the station
any second now!

6
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,460
I haven't had a chance to ask.
How was London?

7
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:01,217
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy. Quite enjoyable.

8
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:03,876
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

9
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,665
I'm perfectly capable
of getting the house ready.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,600
Of course you are. But I'd like
to have the heavy luggage back
and unpacked before they get here.

11
00:01:10,635 --> 00:01:13,500
I suppose...
Steady, William!

12
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,520
This isn't a race.

13
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,845
- Poor lad.
- But he did see her?

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,600
I was worried when
I took him to King's Cross.

15
00:01:22,635 --> 00:01:24,600
Yes, he had time
to say goodbye.

16
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,565
How is he now?

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,320
Well, you've only got one mother,
haven't you?

18
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,640
They're here, Mrs Hughes!

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello, William.
It's good to have you back.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,325
What a relief to be home.

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,400
Don't listen when His Lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season!

22
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:55,805
- When in Rome...
- Will Lady Mary be back soon?

23
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,200
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple of weeks.

24
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,205
So Grantham House is closed?

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,565
It will be by the end of this week.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,060
Dear Mrs Hughes, I hope
you've had some time to yourself
while we've been away.

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,060
I've tackled a few jobs that get
forgotten when the house is full.

28
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,505
Any local news?

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,420
The main topic here is
the murder of the Austrian Archduke.

30
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:18,605
Yeah, here and
everywhere else.

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm afraid we haven't heard
the last of that.

32
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:23,205
- How's William?
- Bearing up.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,460
Poor chap.
He has our sympathies.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,240
- I think I'll wash the train off before dinner.
- Very good, my lord.

35
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,765
- I can unpack while you're bathing.
- I'll see you up there.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,040
Mrs Hughes, have you thought about
the garden party for the hospital?

37
00:02:36,075 --> 00:02:38,960
I've started on it, but there are
things we need to talk about.

38
00:02:38,995 --> 00:02:43,460
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Sybil? You were a great success
in London, darling. Well done.

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,925
- You never say that to me.
- Don't I?

41
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,820
You were very helpful, dear.
Thank you.

42
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,660
I hate to spoil
Her Ladyship's homecoming,

43
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:05,620
but what are we going to do about
Mrs Patmore?

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
She's worse than when you left.
Much worse.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,725
And I meant to ask,

46
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,120
is there a decision
about Mr Bates leaving?

47
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:20,440
Not yet.  His Lordship wants the facts
and Mr Bates won't give them.

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,320
So what are you going to say
to Her Ladyship about Mrs Patmore?

49
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:27,525
Oh, I'm not sure.

50
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,380
I don't want the poor woman sacked,

51
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:33,800
but... things cannot go on
as they are.

52
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,520
There's nothing like an English
summer, is there?

53
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,445
Except an English winter.

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,045
I'm sorry you haven't received
more invitations.

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,420
But then, after four seasons,
one is less a debutante than a survivor.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,280
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
- No.
- Only, one hears stories.

58
00:03:58,515 --> 00:04:00,900
There's nothing,
Aunt Rosamund.

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,225
So, have you decided...

60
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,645
whether or not to marry
Cousin Matthew?

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,040
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep
for more than a month.

62
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:14,885
You'd be surprised.

63
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,120
I've told him I'll give him
my answer the day I get back.

64
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:22,920
Well, it would be very tidy.
At least we can say that.

65
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,560
- Fancy a smoke?
- Don't mind if I do.

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,560
There they go...
Guy Fawkes and his assistant.

67
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:41,860
- Which is which?
- Here you are.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,160
Surely, if His Lordship
hasn't done anything until now,

69
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,960
it means he doesn't want
to take it any further.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Anna's made me
an armband, Mr Carson.

71
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,125
For my mother.
Can I wear it?

72
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,840
I daresay.
Not when we're entertaining,

73
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,620
but otherwise...

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Hello, Doctor.
I didn't know you were here.

75
00:05:15,075 --> 00:05:18,165
No. Lady Grantham
sent a message.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,060
- Why? She's not ill, is she?
- Not... ill, exactly.

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,960
Would you mind waiting
in the library?

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,920
- Pregnant?
- You needn't be quite so shocked.

79
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,300
Give me a moment.

80
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,805
You haven't been pregnant
for 18 years!

81
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,765
- And I'm pregnant now!
- I don't understand what
we've done differently.

82
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
Stop right there! If you want to know
more, go and offer the doctor some whisky.

83
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:49,200
I can't take it in.

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,800
But... you're pleased?

85
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,240
Of course...
Of course I'm pleased.

86
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
I didn't think she'd do it.

87
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,445
I told you she would.

88
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,525
I could see she was interested.

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,060
Now I was speaking as one lady's maid
to another. That means something!

90
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:21,560
Course, we thought we had him before
but he's a slippery devil.

91
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,160
It's unusual, obviously.

92
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:33,480
Unusual? It's Biblical!

93
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:35,360
Not quite.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,480
You understand that women
go through a... certain change.

95
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:44,160
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

96
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,220
Well, sometimes
it can result in a...

97
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:51,245
a surge of fertility,
for want of a better word.

98
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,680
- But the child will be healthy?
- There's no reason why not.

99
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,685
How long has she...?

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,920
Hard to be precise.
Things had become irregular, but...

101
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,360
- Please...
- I'd say she's about four months gone.

102
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,280
It'll begin to show soon.

103
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,180
And I don't suppose there's
any way of knowing... if it's a...

104
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,920
I do beg your pardon, my lord.
I thought you were alone.

105
00:07:16,955 --> 00:07:19,080
Please come in, Mrs Hughes.

106
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:20,405
I'm just leaving.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,805
- William?
- Well, thank you, Doctor.

108
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,160
- I'd better start writing some letters.
- Show Dr Clarkson out.

109
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,880
I didn't want to bother
Her Ladyship if she's not well...

110
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,160
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

111
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,485
It's Mrs Patmore, my lord.

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,860
The time has come when we really
have to make a decision.

113
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,035
- Now do you believe me?
- Careful, Thomas.

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,480
Your position is not a strong one.

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Don't punish us, Mr Carson.
It's Mr Bates who's wanting here.

116
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,520
Tell me, Mr. Carson, do you think it right,
a man like that should live and work
at Downton?

117
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,545
Mr Napier, my lady.

118
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,340
What a surprise!

119
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,860
I'm afraid you've just
missed my aunt.

120
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,605
I know.

121
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,240
I watched her leave.

122
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,960
How are your wedding plans going?

123
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,260
Not very well.

124
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,660
In fact, we've decided
to call it off.

125
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,640
Really?

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,140
It seemed quite fixed
at Sybil's ball.

127
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,280
What a shame...
Please.

128
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,440
- It'll be better in the long run.
- Perhaps.

129
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,300
I know what high hopes
you have of the institution.

130
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,400
The thing is, Lady Mary...

131
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,845
I'm here today because I needed
to tell you something face to face,
before you went to the country.

132
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,680
Face to face?
Gracious me...

133
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,360
I've recently heard gossip about
the time when I came to Downton
with Kemal Pamuk.

134
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,060
Gossip that I believe has made life
difficult for you.

135
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,800
I've also heard it said that
I am the source of these stories.

136
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,400
It is very important to me
that you should know that I am not.

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,280
From that day to this, I have never
spoken one word on the matter.

138
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,760
Then who did?

139
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,000
It seems to have come from
the Turkish Embassy,

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,280
from the Ambassador himself,
in fact, and his wife.

141
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,560
But who told them, if not you?

142
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,040
This is the hard part.

143
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,320
When I discovered the answer,
I debated whether I should relay it,

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,480
but in the end,
I feel you ought to know.

145
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,520
The suspense is killing me.

146
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,200
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

147
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,680
That is why people accept the story.

148
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,800
Edith?

149
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,880
It's very hard to believe.

150
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,120
Harder for you than for me.

151
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,280
I love the thought of a baby in
the house, but if it's a boy...

152
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,000
It'll be very hard on Mr Crawley.

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,640
I know. I was no great champion
when he first arrived.

154
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,380
But it seems to me he's tried his best
and he's done the decent thing.

155
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,240
I can't see that coming off.

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,240
You don't mean
the engagement?

157
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,260
But it's not
an engagement yet, is it?

158
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,860
She'd never throw him over!

159
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Mr Carson, Lady Mary Crawley
does not deserve you.

160
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:17,081
And she's not be in touch
with Cousin Matthew.

161
00:11:17,182 --> 00:11:19,082
Not that I'm told...

162
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Wonderful news, of course.
You must look after yourself.

163
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,640
Don't worry. O'Brien has me
wrapped in silk and feathers.

164
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,840
You're lucky.

165
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,200
I have a horrible feeling Simmons
is about to hand in her notice.

166
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,960
She's looking very fidgety lately,

167
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,560
and I saw her hurrying
to meet the postman.

168
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,840
Oh, you poor thing.

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,780
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

170
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,280
Why would she want to leave me?

171
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,220
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

172
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,300
Most of the time.

173
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,200
I want to say I'll make
provision for you

174
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,040
if it's a boy and
you get pushed out.

175
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,620
Don't worry.
I know you can't.

176
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,720
If any man living understands
the strength of the entail, it's me.

177
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,060
I can give you Crawley House
for life, if it's a help.

178
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,300
- Have you heard from Mary?
- No. Have you?

179
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,080
By the way, I want to ask a favour.
What's the name of your cook,

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,440
the one you brought with you
from Manchester?

181
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,340
Mrs Bird?

182
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,100
- I'll get it, Mrs Patmore!
- Don't fuss me!

183
00:12:37,135 --> 00:12:39,020
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,045
How are you feeling?

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,260
Well, most people's parents die
before them, and so they should.

186
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh, give it a rest. Your mother knew
how to drag it out. I'll say that for her.

187
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:50,205
- What?
- Thomas!

188
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,265
Get up to the servery.

189
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,080
- You gave me the wrong cloth!
- Sit down, Mrs Patmore.

190
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,240
I can't when I've got
the luncheon to finish!

191
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:02,040
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

192
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,600
Daisy and I will finish
the luncheon.

193
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,160
So he'll give us this house
for life, will he? How generous

194
00:13:17,195 --> 00:13:20,400
It is generous.
He doesn't have to.

195
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,820
But it's made me think.

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,645
You must stay here if you want.

197
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,960
But I wonder if it mightn't be better
all round if I went back to Manchester.

198
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,685
It may not be a boy.

199
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,280
Oh, really, Mother!
You never approved of it all anyway,
in the first place!

200
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:40,680
If it is a boy,
you should see it as a release,

201
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,777
not a disappointment.

202
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:45,340
What does Mary say?

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,480
Nothing yet.

204
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,165
You wanted to see Mrs Bird, sir.

205
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,880
Yes. Mrs Bird, Lord Grantham
has rather a favour to ask of you.

206
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,580
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Quite all right.

208
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,320
Mr Bates, it's about your
somewhat startling confession.

209
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
As you'll have surmised,
His Lordship has yet to make a decision.

210
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,920
His delay is generous.

211
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:34,625
However, it will be
no surprise to you

212
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,520
that Miss O'Brien
has  been unwilling to let things drop.

213
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,620
It seems that when we were in
London, she made a new friend...

214
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,200
a lady's maid in the house
of a colonel in your former regiment.

215
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,100
Please tell me that this account
is false, at least in part.

216
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,480
I wish I could.

217
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,760
I'll have to show this
to His Lordship.

218
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
Of course you will.

219
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:12,361
I do not like to play
the part of Pontius Pilate,

220
00:15:12,362 --> 00:15:15,080
but I'm afraid I must.

221
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Lord Grantham will decide
what's to be done.

222
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,160
Mr Bates, I hope you do not feel
that I treated you unjustly.

223
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,180
On the contrary, Mr Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.

224
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,280
Of all of you, Sybil might find joy
in a cottage, but not you.

225
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,760
- We don't know it'll be a boy.
- Exactly.

226
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,120
So ask Matthew to wait
until the child is born.

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,520
If it's a girl, you can wed him happily
and all will be as it was before.

228
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,640
But if I delay, won't he think
I'm only after him for his position?

229
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Besides, I'm not sure
I want to put him off,

230
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,080
even without the title.

231
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,840
We get on so well, you know.
And he's terribly clever.

232
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,160
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

233
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,280
And he might not.

234
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

235
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,800
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

236
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,200
as the wife of a country solicitor?

237
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,840
But why would we ever want
a telephone at Downton, my lord?

238
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,880
Well, they have their uses.

239
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
You could speak
to the housekeeper in London.

240
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,400
That'd be helpful, surely?

241
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,840
I hope I have not failed in my
management of the recent move?

242
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,400
Not at all.
But the telephone is here now,

243
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,000
and the girls got used to it
when we were in London.

244
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,320
Besides, none of us know what
the next few months will bring.

245
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,600
Because of the Archduke's death?

246
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,560
Austria won't get what it wants
from Serbia.

247
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,840
And now Russia's starting to rumble.

248
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Well, there's not much
we can do about that.

249
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,580
So, will you take care
of the telephone, man?

250
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,240
Oh, about Mr Bates, my lord.

251
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,840
I expect you've had time to consider
the contents of that letter?

252
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,840
Yes. But I find it very odd.

253
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
Regimental silver?

254
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,100
I could more easily see Bates
as an assassin than a petty pilferer.

255
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,980
I agree. And while the letter
is hard to argue with,

256
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,820
I wouldn't put anything past
Thomas or Miss O'Brien.

257
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,800
- So, what did we miss?
- Nothing much.

258
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:44,585
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

259
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,640
- Have you thought about Matthew?
- Of course.

260
00:17:47,675 --> 00:17:51,860
- But Aunt Rosamund says
- No. She's written to me.
I should pay no attention.

261
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:55,120
But Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naive.

262
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,360
- I don't need your help, thank you.
- Mary, listen to me.

263
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,420
If you take Matthew now,
when his whole future is at risk,

264
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,860
he will love you
to the end of his days.

265
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,060
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

266
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,680
I've been called many things,
but never that.

267
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,820
And what happens if the baby is a boy
and Matthew loses everything?

268
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,780
- Mary can always change her mind.
- But I can't do that to Matthew.

269
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,140
It's not how we are together.

270
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,340
I'm going upstairs
to help Anna unpack.

271
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,260
I'll come with you.

272
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,140
Edith, why don't you go too?

273
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,200
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

274
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,380
He asked after you.

275
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,020
- Is she really serious about him?
- Any port in a storm...

276
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,500
By the way,
I must write about my maid.

277
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,540
She's leaving, to get married.

278
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,860
- How could she be so selfish?
- I do sympathise.

279
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,360
Robert's always wanted me to get rid
of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

280
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,880
Anyway, she's so fond of me.

281
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,780
Well, I thought Simmons
was fond of ME!

282
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,200
What am I to do?

283
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,880
Well, I'll put an advertisement in The Lady.
It's always the best place to start.

284
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,940
Oh! That's so kind.
Thank you.

285
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,020
I really must be going.

286
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,900
Now, don't let Mary wait for the baby
before she gives Matthew her answer.

287
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,580
I'm sure it's another girl.

288
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,700
I know those men
of the moral high ground.

289
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,100
If she won't say yes
when he might be poor,

290
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,920
he won't want her
when he will be rich.

291
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,900
Maybe we should knit something.

292
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,020
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love
a pair of bootees knitted by you.

293
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,460
Or what about a Christening mug?
They can buy their own silver.

294
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,580
- Anything in the paper, Thomas?
- They've arrested this Princip fella
with his gang.

295
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,020
All Serbian and members
of the Black Hand.

296
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,600
- The Black Hand?
- I don't like the sound of that.

297
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,320
I don't like the sound
of any of it.  War is on the way.

298
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,070
Then we'll have to face it...
as bravely as we can.

299
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,740
Thank you, Mr Cannon Fodder.

300
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,620
Don't you think a war's coming?

301
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:12,860
Oh, there'll be a war, all right.
And it's time to prepare for it.

302
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:15,985
- The country, do you mean?
- No. Me.

303
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,265
You never disappoint.

304
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,460
Daisy, run and find Mrs Patmore.

305
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,660
His Lordship wants to see her
in the library.

306
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,660
His Lordship wants Mrs Patmore
to go up to the library?

307
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,540
That is what I said.

308
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,040
And Anna, you're to come too.

309
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,280
And we thought the assassination
of an archduke was a surprise.

310
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,740
Mrs Patmore, my lord.

311
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,980
Your Lordship, I know things haven't
been quite right for a while,

312
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,580
- but I can assure you
- Come in, Mrs Patmore.

313
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,300
I promise you, my lord, if I could
just be allowed a bit more time...

314
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,480
Mrs Patmore, I have not asked you
here to give you your notice.

315
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,900
- Haven't you?
- No.

316
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,180
- I understand you've had
some trouble with your sight.
- That's just it!

317
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,640
- I know I could manage better if...
- Please, Mrs Patmore!
- Let him speak!

318
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
- Beg pardon, my lord.
- Don't apologise.

319
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,340
Now, on Dr Clarkson's
recommendation,

320
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,680
I'm sending you up to London to see
an eye specialist at Moorfields.

321
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,600
Anna will go with you and you'll
stay with my sister Rosamund

322
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,880
in her new house in Belgrave Square.

323
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,180
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit
in your presence, my lord.

324
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,560
Of course.

325
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,040
But how will you get on here?

326
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,140
Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us
her cook... Mrs Bird.

327
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,940
She's coming over tomorrow.
You will be good enough
to show her how things work.

328
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,140
Are the Crawleys to starve
while I'm away?

329
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,540
They'll eat here every evening.

330
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,140
Now, my sister's butler
will look after you.

331
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,500
He's very nice.  Anna,
you won't mind a visit to London?

332
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,320
No, my lord. Thank you.
It'll be an adventure.

333
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:08,140
One with a happy ending, I hope.

334
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,460
Let me get this clear...
At Sybil's ball you said you'd give
me your answer the day you got back.

335
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,340
- And now you say you will not!
- Why do we have to rush into it?

336
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,180
- I need to be sure, that's all.
- But you WERE sure.

337
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,600
I know what has altered you.
My prospects!

338
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,580
- Because nothing else has changed!
- No!        - Yes!

339
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,800
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir and I go back
to living on my wits!

340
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,980
- You'd rather not follow me.
- Oh, Matthew, you always make
everything so black and white!

341
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,380
I think this IS black and white!

342
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,100
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

343
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,340
If you don't,
then say no.

344
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,960
- If you do, then say yes.
- I want to...

345
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,800
Granny told me I should say yes now,

346
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,480
then withdraw
if you lost everything.

347
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,040
To make that work,
you'd have to be a good liar.

348
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,220
- Are you a good liar?
- Not good enough to try, apparently.

349
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,600
How could you not have realised
they'd discover the loss at once?

350
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:20,180
And to keep them in your house...

351
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,605
- But you only served two years?
- That's right, my lord.

352
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,080
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating factor.

353
00:23:29,315 --> 00:23:31,900
I just want to know the truth.

354
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,965
I cannot speak of it, my lord.

355
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,805
You must decide whether I stay or go
on the basis of the evidence before you.

356
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,920
I will respect that.

357
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,605
I'm sorry.
I don't believe it.

358
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,500
How can you say that?
When I've confessed to the crime?

359
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,240
His Lordship obviously doesn't think
that's all there is to it,

360
00:23:58,275 --> 00:24:00,085
and I don't either.

361
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,280
Anna, are you set for the
nine o'clock train tomorrow?

362
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,755
All packed and ready.

363
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,140
You'll be met at King's Cross by
Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

364
00:24:08,175 --> 00:24:11,817
which I think is generous, but
after that, you're on your own.

365
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:16,260
Right, I must get on. I'm acting referee
for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.

366
00:24:16,295 --> 00:24:17,880
Best of luck.

367
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,745
Will you miss me?

368
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,220
Try not to miss me.
It'll be good practice.

369
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,720
I expect it'll be hard
adjusting to this kitchen,

370
00:24:39,755 --> 00:24:42,497
- after the one you're used to.
- Not to worry.

371
00:24:42,832 --> 00:24:45,932
I'm sure I can have it
cleaned up in no time.

372
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,165
- Cleaned up?
- I'm not criticising.

373
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,160
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

374
00:24:53,295 --> 00:24:56,845
- You'll have met Daisy and the others?
- I have.

375
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,800
Though what they all find to do
is a mystery to me.

376
00:24:59,835 --> 00:25:03,085
Are you not used to managing
staff, Mrs Bird?

377
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm used to getting it done with
one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore,

378
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:13,400
but I suppose, in a house like this,
you expect to take it easy.

379
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,160
Do you think we should erect
a ring and let them fight it out?

380
00:25:18,195 --> 00:25:20,485
She's all right, Mrs Bird.

381
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,925
She's more of a general than a trooper,
but you need that in a cook.

382
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,060
Mrs Patmore's the Generalissimo.

383
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,720
Well, I'm very sad.

384
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,720
I thought Mary was made
of better stuff.

385
00:25:40,755 --> 00:25:42,740
Don't speak against her.

386
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,280
of course, she's taken advice from
someone with false and greedy values.

387
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:50,337
- Mother!...
- And we don't have to go too
far to know who that is!

388
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:53,660
- I've a good mind...
- You do not go near Cousin Violet.
That is an order.

389
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,525
- Something's not right about it.
- I agree.

390
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,700
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

391
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,560
even if he COULD walk.

392
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,885
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

393
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,600
and he normally comes down
on this sort of thing like a storm of bricks.

394
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,325
- What's his reasoning?
- He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

395
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,485
He says they've been working against
Bates since he got here.

396
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,420
- So I should sack O'Brien instead?
- You'll hear no argument from me.

397
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:23,040
This should do the trick, my lady.

398
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,900
Ten years of my life,
That's what I've given her.
Ten bloody years!

399
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:34,425
- But did she say she'd sack you?
- It's obviously what he wants.

400
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,565
- So when will they tell you?
- When they've found a replacement.

401
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,480
Heaven forefend she should have to
put a comb through her own hair!

402
00:26:41,515 --> 00:26:45,760
- And if I'm going, you won't be far behind.
- Oh, so what?  Sod 'em.

403
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:48,125
There's a war coming
and war means change.

404
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,545
- We should be making plans.
- What are you talking about?

405
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,180
Well, put it like this.  I don't want
to be a footman any more,

406
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,480
but I don't intend to be killed
in battle neither.

407
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,365
I'm not saying poison them!

408
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,600
Just make sure they don't find
her food all that agreeable.

409
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,680
- By poisoning it?
- Will you stop that?

410
00:27:13,815 --> 00:27:16,125
You don't want it to taste nice.

411
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,000
I want them to be glad
when I get back, that's all.

412
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,580
This will be for the family,

413
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,300
and the one in my pantry for the staff.
or, more precisely... me.

414
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,320
You don't know
we don't provide two?

415
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,800
Then, perhaps, we should
find another suplier.

416
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,660
Oh... hold your horses.

417
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,100
Right... Where do you said
this other telephone?

418
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
Here... in the outer hall.

419
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,220
- Good afternoon, Carson.
Is Lady Edith in?
- I am! I most certainly am!

420
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,325
- I was just driving past.
- Yes?

421
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,720
And I thought you might like to come
for a spin. If you're not too busy.

422
00:27:56,755 --> 00:28:00,080
- Wait till I get my coat.
- Is it all right if I make some notes?

423
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:04,440
- I'm so sorry, Mr...?
- This is Mr Bromidge, my lady.

424
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,485
He's here about the telephone.

425
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,045
Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr Bromidge.

426
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,520
We're so looking forward to it.
What an exciting business to be in!

427
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:15,320
- You must be expanding every day.
- Oh, we are, sir.

428
00:28:15,355 --> 00:28:17,765
But that brings its problems.

429
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,600
Training up men for the work,
when many have no aptitude.

430
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:24,400
I can't even find a secretary
who can keep pace with the moment.

431
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,840
- What?
- It's hard with a new concept.

432
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:29,205
Too old, and they can't change.

433
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,165
Too young,
and they've no experience.

434
00:28:31,185 --> 00:28:33,845
But have you filled the post yet?
Cause I know just the woman.

435
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,200
Well, she must hurry up.
We'll close the list tomorrow night.

436
00:28:37,235 --> 00:28:39,720
You'll have her application.
I promise.

437
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
MOORFIELDS
Eye Hospital

438
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,260
- This isn't bad at all, is it?
- I don't know.

439
00:28:58,295 --> 00:29:01,200
No one told me
there'd be an actual operation.

440
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:03,165
What did you think?

441
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,080
They were just going to make magic
passes over your eyes?

442
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,300
All right, Mrs... Patmore?

443
00:29:10,335 --> 00:29:12,885
She'll be fine.
Thank you.

444
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,040
And you've been sent to us
by the Earl of Grantham?

445
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:20,245
- That's right.
- Very good. You can leave now.

446
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,360
We'll keep her in for a week.
You can collect her next Friday.

447
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,960
- I'll be in to visit every day.
- What about the rest of the time?

448
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:33,920
Don't worry!

449
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,440
You'll be fine.

450
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,245
- Bates, you say?
- John Bates.

451
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,300
He must have left the army
about eight years ago.

452
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,080
Wait here, please.

453
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,480
- Have you finished the soup?
- I think so, Mrs Bird.

454
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:56,120
- And the sauce for the fish?
- Yes, Mrs Bird.

455
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,040
Then put them in the warmer.

456
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,240
You don't mean John Bates,
who went to prison for theft?

457
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:36,220
- That's correct.
- Well, I know who he is right enough.

458
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:38,397
That was an odd business.

459
00:31:38,832 --> 00:31:42,205
- Why odd?
- Never mind.

460
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,680
So you're his cousin
and you'd like to be in touch?

461
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,845
Very forgiving.

462
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,305
Well, I've got no address
for him or his wife.

463
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,920
But I have got one for his mother,
which should still be good.

464
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,000
I've written it down for you.

465
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,600
Thank you for your trouble.

466
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,960
Is it true you wrote to the
Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?

467
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,540
- Who told you?
- Someone who knows that you did.

468
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,875
Then why are you asking?

469
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,960
Because I wanted to give you one
last chance to deny it.

470
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,640
And what if I did? He had a right
to know how his countryman died.

471
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,060
In the arms of a slut.

472
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,120
How's that advertisement
getting on for new maid?

473
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:52,725
Well, it's only just come out.

474
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,760
We can manage here now. Go tell Mrs Bird
we'll have our dinner in 20 minutes.

475
00:32:57,795 --> 00:33:02,380
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs Bird
the dinner was really delicious.

476
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,820
- So, how was the drive?
- It was lovely.

477
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,400
Only...

478
00:33:17,401 --> 00:33:18,501
Yes?

479
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,020
Well, he said he had
a question for me.

480
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:27,500
He told me he'd ask it
at the garden party and...

481
00:33:27,535 --> 00:33:30,340
he hoped I'd say yes.

482
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,040
You must think very carefully
what your answer will be.

483
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:40,120
Yes, I should think very carefully
about a lot of things.

484
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,640
- Do your neighbours have one?
- Yes, they do. In London, anyway.

485
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:46,605
It seems very wise
to get this telephone now.

486
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,560
If there is a war, it may be very hard
to have one installed in a private house.

487
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:51,560
Let me show you where
we're going to put it.

488
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:54,645
First electricity
now telephones.

489
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,980
Sometimes I feel as if I were living
in an HG Wells novel.

490
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,640
But the young are all so calm about
change, aren't they?

491
00:34:05,675 --> 00:34:09,760
Look at Matthew.
I do admire him.

492
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:11,640
Do you?

493
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,720
- What have I done wrong now?
- Oh, please.

494
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,280
Don't pretend Mary's
sudden reluctance

495
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:21,325
can't be traced back to you.

496
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,820
Well, I shall pretend it.
I told her to take him.

497
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:28,880
Your quarrel is with my daughter
Rosamund, not me.

498
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,800
So put that in your pipe
and smoke it!

499
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,685
Mr Molesley.
What are you after?

500
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,540
I want a word with Mr Carson.
I'm here to have my dinner.

501
00:34:47,575 --> 00:34:51,040
- You don't want much, do you?
- What are you doing?

502
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,680
Mr Carson dropped his wallet
in the passage. I was replacing it.

503
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,720
But everything seemed so settled
between you at Sybil's ball.

504
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:11,920
Things have changed since then.

505
00:35:11,955 --> 00:35:14,045
Not necessarily.

506
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,785
I don't seem to be much good
at making boys.

507
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,820
Any more than I'm much good
at building my life on shifting sands.

508
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,960
You do know I should be very proud
to have you as my son-in-law,

509
00:35:26,995 --> 00:35:28,840
whatever your prospects?

510
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,340
Unfortunately, sir, your daughter
is more practical than you.

511
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,780
- Will you join us, Mrs Bird?
- I don't mind if I do.

512
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:44,527
I'm not sure Mrs Patmore
would like that, Mr Carson.

513
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:47,340
Cook always eats separate,
that's what she says.

514
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:50,360
Not in our house.
There's only the four of us.

515
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,220
Well, you're going any minute.
She's advertised for your replacement.

516
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:56,580
That filthy, ungrateful cow.

517
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,040
Let the kitchen maids have theirs
on their own.  You stay with us.

518
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:05,520
Her Ladyship said to tell you
that the dinner was delicious.

519
00:36:05,555 --> 00:36:10,440
- She can't have!
- Daisy? Does that surprise you?

520
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,120
What have you done with this,
you little beggar?  I knew it!

521
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,080
That's why I said
it was for upstairs.

522
00:36:34,115 --> 00:36:36,640
Come on! Tell us what's in it!

523
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,460
Just... water and

524
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:41,661
a bit of soap.

525
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:48,440
And you've put something
in the fish sauce as well?

526
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,860
Only... mustard and aniseed.

527
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,880
Why, Daisy?
Why would you do such a thing?

528
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,680
Mrs Patmore was worried than
they'd prefer Mrs Bird's cooking

529
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,200
- and they wouldn't want her
to come back.
- Is that likely?

530
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:08,200
When they've taken such trouble
to get her well?

531
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:09,980
I'm sorry!

532
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,145
There, there.

533
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,725
There are worse crimes on earth
than loyalty.

534
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,520
Dry your eyes, and fetch the beef stew
I was making for tomorrow.

535
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:30,520
You've not had a chance
to spoil that, I suppose?

536
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:34,680
Those going make seen some syrup
of figs, but I've not done it yet.

537
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,600
(*), but at least
we'd  all have been regular.

538
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,845
Carson said you were here.

539
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,405
Just checking that everything's
being done right, my lady.

540
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,320
Only, we never heard back. That is,
Miss Dawson never heard back from you,

541
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,165
about an interview.

542
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,325
Er, yes, we got
the young lady's letter.

543
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,340
But the trouble is, she didn't have
any obvious experience of hard work.

544
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:04,017
- But she's a very hard worker!
- I couldn't find any proof of it.

545
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:08,160
And she gave you as a reference,
when you don't run a business, my lady.

546
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:10,665
Well, not that I'm aware of.

547
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,660
Lily? Can you find Gwen and tell her
to come to the hall now?

548
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:16,085
Yes, my lady.

549
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,780
The reason Gwen didn't give
any more details

550
00:38:18,815 --> 00:38:21,817
is because she works here,
as a housemaid.

551
00:38:21,852 --> 00:38:24,520
Ah! And you thought
that'd put me off?

552
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:26,445
But she's taken a postal course

553
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,320
and has good speeds in typing
and Pitman shorthand. Test her!

554
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:33,240
I will, if I like the look of her.

555
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:35,405
Ah, so, young lady.

556
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,280
You thought I'd turn up my nose
at a housemaid?

557
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:42,520
- Well, I did, sir.
- Well, my mother was a housemaid.

558
00:38:42,555 --> 00:38:44,685
I've got nothing against housemaids.

559
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,440
They know about hard work
and long hours, that's for sure.

560
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:49,165
I believe so, sir.

561
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,320
Right, well, is there somewhere
we could talk?

562
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:54,320
Gwen, take Mr Bromidge
to the library.

563
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:56,280
I'll see no one disturbs you.

564
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,880
Sorry, Papa, you can't go in there.

565
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,645
Why on earth not?

566
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,920
Gwen's in there with Mr Bromidge.
She's being interviewed.

567
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:17,365
I cannot use my library

568
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,340
because one of the housemaids is in there
applying for another job?

569
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
That's about the size of it.

570
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,200
So, what is it you want to know?

571
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,320
I want to know the truth about
the case against him.

572
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,560
I want to know why the sergeant
thought it was "odd".

573
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,580
I want to know what
Mr Bates isn't saying.

574
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,640
Because you don't believe him
to be guilty?

575
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:52,897
No, I don't.

576
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:55,120
I know he's not.

577
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:57,300
Well...

578
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,740
You're right, of course.

579
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,740
Then who was it?
Who was the thief?

580
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,040
His wife. Vera.

581
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,400
Who do you call?
No one you know has got one!

582
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:17,535
But they will have.
You'll see.

583
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,460
Might I enquire why my pantry
has become a common room?

584
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:23,425
Sorry, Mr Carson.

585
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,960
But... do you know how it works?

586
00:40:26,995 --> 00:40:29,925
- Of course I do.
- Could you show us?

587
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,125
Certainly not.
A telephone is not a toy,

588
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,180
but a useful and valuable tool.
Now, get back to your work.

589
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,760
She worked at the barracks sometimes,
helping at big dinners and so on.

590
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:09,180
That night her opportunity came
and she took it.

591
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,445
They knew it was her.

592
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,680
Someone even saw her
with a big carryall.

593
00:41:14,715 --> 00:41:16,840
But why did he confess?

594
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,020
Well...

595
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,245
John wasn't the same man
in those days.

596
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,000
The African war had shaken him up
and made him angry.

597
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,205
He'd been wounded

598
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,940
and he drunk a lot more
than was good for him.

599
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,785
- Was he violent?
- No. No, not violent.

600
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,120
He could had hard at times,
with a tongue like a razor.

601
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:48,400
He felt he'd ruined Vera's life,
Miss Smith.

602
00:41:48,835 --> 00:41:51,565
- Do you agree with him?
- No.

603
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,960
I thought she was a nasty
piece of work, but...

604
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:58,360
That's why he tooks the blame.

605
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,800
- Surely, if everyone knew
he was innocent...
- But he confessed!

606
00:42:04,835 --> 00:42:09,600
There was nothing anybody could do
once he'd confessed.

607
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,725
Could I ask you something, sir?

608
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,160
Only, I get the feeling that
a war's on the way.

609
00:42:19,295 --> 00:42:20,945
I'm afraid we all do.

610
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,720
And when it comes, I want to be
really useful to my country.

611
00:42:23,755 --> 00:42:25,605
- How heartening.
- So I've been thinking,

612
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,180
what could be more useful
than what you do?

613
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,720
Bringing people back to health,
back to life.

614
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:32,245
I see.

615
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:37,645
Well, erm, we are looking for volunteers
to train for the Territorial Force hospitals,

616
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,485
- if that's what you mean.
- It's exactly what I mean.

617
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:44,080
- Will you not be missed here?
- Maybe. But we'll all be going, won't we?

618
00:42:44,115 --> 00:42:46,205
The younger men, anyway.

619
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,960
As you wish. I'll make enquiries.

620
00:42:48,995 --> 00:42:51,240
Thank you very much, Doctor.

621
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,080
Mr Molesley walked in and there
he was, as bold as brass,

622
00:42:58,115 --> 00:43:00,880
taking my wallet
out of my change coat.

623
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,720
Mr Molesley would have no reason
to make it up, my lord.

624
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:07,337
He doesn't know Thomas.
Why would he lie?

625
00:43:07,372 --> 00:43:09,920
So Thomas has been caught
red-handed.

626
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,645
Well, we knew he was a thief.

627
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,480
And now we have unimpeachable proof.

628
00:43:14,515 --> 00:43:19,015
- I'm afraid he has to go.
- Oh, I hate this sort of thing,

629
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,365
with Lady Grantham's condition
and everything.

630
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,260
Can we at least wait
until after the garden party?

631
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:28,820
Very well, my lord.
But then I think we must act.

632
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,465
- How long will you wear them?
- A week or so.

633
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,225
But I can see much better already,
even with them on.

634
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,760
Thank heaven. Now, we need to talk
about the garden party.

635
00:43:42,795 --> 00:43:46,245
- Mrs Bird and I have made some lists.
- Hum... Mrs Bird?

636
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,620
I think we can manage
without any help from Mrs Bird.

637
00:43:49,655 --> 00:43:51,045
Can you?

638
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,240
Well, if you want your garden party to be
run by Blind Pugh, that's your business.

639
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,320
Mrs Patmore, there's a lot to be done
and you're only just up on your feet.

640
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:05,180
- We really cannot manage
without Mrs Bird.
- If you say so.

641
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:07,245
Now, I've been checking the stores

642
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,325
and I've ordered what you'll need
for the baking.

643
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,880
That's very kind, Mrs Hughes, but
I believe WE should check the stores,

644
00:44:14,915 --> 00:44:16,765
when it's convenient.

645
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,765
Mrs Bird, at Downton Abbey,

646
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,000
the housekeeper manages
the store cupboard, but I think if...

647
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,765
I've never not run my own store
cupboard in my life.

648
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,640
Separate the cook from the store cupboard?
Where's the sense in that?

649
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:32,685
How long have I been saying this,
oh, Lord?

650
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,300
We're the ones who cook it.
We should be the ones to order it.

651
00:44:37,335 --> 00:44:42,480
Mrs Bird, I shall be very happy
of your help with the garden party.

652
00:44:42,515 --> 00:44:46,600
I'm sure we can manage it easily...
between the two of us.

653
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,945
Hello?

654
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,365
This is Downton Abbey.

655
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,460
Carson the butler speaking.

656
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,445
Hello.

657
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,840
This is Mr Carson,
the butler, of Downton Abbey.

658
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:22,200
To whom am I speaking?

659
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,760
I'm not shouting!

660
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,180
Who are you?

661
00:45:28,415 --> 00:45:30,405
Oh. Mrs Gaunt.

662
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,520
No, I don't want to place a call.

663
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,260
I was practising my answer.

664
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,400
Well, I daresay a lot of the things
you do sound stupid to other people!

665
00:45:41,635 --> 00:45:46,485
I've written to your mother.
She's very anxious, naturally.

666
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,300
She suggested coming over.

667
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,200
- Oh, God.
- Well, that's what I thought.

668
00:45:51,235 --> 00:45:54,700
So I put her off. Told her to come
and admire the baby.

669
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,485
- I'll just run Your Ladyship's bath.
- Thank you, O'Brien.

670
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,820
- Oh, have you had any answers
about the position?
- Quite a few.

671
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:12,460
- So what did they sound like?
- There's one I think has real possibilities.

672
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:16,740
She learned to do hair in Paris
while she's working for the Ambassadress.

673
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,560
Oh, that one sounds promising.

674
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,885
- Carson, I've been meaning...
- Your Lordship?

675
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,940
- Anna, you're back safely, then?
- Yes, thank you, my lord.

676
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,880
- And Mrs Patmore's fighting fit again.
- "Fighting fit" is the phrase!

677
00:46:35,915 --> 00:46:37,815
Is something the matter?

678
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,220
- I wanted to see Your Lordship because...
- Please.

679
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,520
While I was in London, I learned
something about Mr Bates.

680
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,840
- Not bad, I hope.
- No. Not bad at all.

681
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,640
I'd have told Mr Carson, but I thought
you might like to hear it from me first.

682
00:46:58,675 --> 00:47:03,120
- Go on.
- I went to call on Mr Bates's mother.

683
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,800
O'Brien, how long do you think
it takes a lady's maid to settle in?

684
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,640
- Depends on the maid, my lady.
- Of course it does.

685
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,600
Oops! Sorry.

686
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,820
- The other half is under the bath.
- Never mind. Thank you.

687
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:45,660
- I'll just go and sort out
your clothes, my lady.
- Thank you.

688
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,480
Sarah O'Brien,
this is not who you are.

689
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,240
My lady, if you could just wait...

690
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,500
Doctor's gone, your Lordship, but
he's coming back after dinner.

691
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,300
Lady Mary is with her now.

692
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,500
Thank you.

693
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,400
I don't suppose you want to change.

694
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,300
Is there anything else
I can do to be useful?

695
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,300
It was a boy.

696
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,400
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to embarras you.

697
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
I'm not embarrased.

698
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,000
I just wish you could've
been speared of this.

699
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,900
Thank you.

700
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,400
By the way, Anna's told me
what she learned in London.

701
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,100
She... She's not told me.

702
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
The good news is you were
believed in Downton.

703
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,400
I need some good news today.

704
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,100
That poor babe.

705
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,000
How is Her Ladyship doing?

706
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:38,000
I'll take her a cup of tea in a minute,
but I don't see she'd touched a bite.

707
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,200
- What about you, Miss O'Brien?
- What about me?

708
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,300
We assume it was quite a shock.

709
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,800
Yes. Yes, it was.

710
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And you'll better dine with us, Mr Branson.
We can't know if you might be needed later.

711
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,800
Well, I'll go after the Doctor at 10.

712
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,900
What's a long face a lot.

713
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Kindly show some respect.

714
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,700
Come on, Mr. Carson. You should be over it.
They're not bigger than a hamster at that stage.

715
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,100
Would you shut up?!

716
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,700
I agree. What is
the matter with you, Thomas?

717
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't know. I suppose all that
makes me feel claustrophobic.

718
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I mean, I'm sorry, of course I am.

719
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,600
But why must we live through them?
They're just our employers,
they're not our flesh and blood.

720
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,500
- Thomas, don't be so unkind.
- There is nothing left on Earth you respect?

721
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,720
'Ark at 'im...  Blimey, if he carries on like this
for the unborn baby of a woman
who scarcely know his name...

722
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,200
No wonder he fell to pieces
when the old mum snuffed it.

723
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,300
William!

724
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,500
Thomas! William!
Stop! That it's enough!

725
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,200
Oh, Thomas!

726
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,340
I've done as I promised. General Burke
is commanding the Division of Richmond.

727
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,700
I think I may have a place there for you.

728
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,000
And Colonel Cartwright...
These are the papers.

729
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,600
When you are ready... report to the local
recruiting office and I'll take it from there.

730
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:13,000
As a matter of fact, I've been drafted back
as Capitain.  So, I'll try to keep an eye on you.

731
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,400
That's very kind of you, Doctor.

732
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,400
With any luck, there may be some advantage
in you having volunteered so early.

733
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,080
Oh, hang on a minute! Give me yours and
take these one at the same time.

734
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,000
William, I'm sorry I've been
so unkind to you lately.

735
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,100
That's all right.

736
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,000
No, it's not all right.  I don't know
why I've said those things.

737
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
- Well, you were under an evil spell.
- I'm not under anymore.

738
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,600
- I'm glad.
- Friends?

739
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,300
Always friends.

740
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,600
I think we should start the Ices, now...
If you agree, Mrs Patmore.

741
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,300
Certainly, Mrs. Bird.

742
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, my Lord!
Listen to that!

743
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,300
Mr. Carson's telephone is ringing.

744
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,900
There is someone
who's going to answer?

745
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,600
I wouldn't touch that thing
with a ten foot pole!

746
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,500
Then I will that.

747
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
No, Mr. Carson is busy.
Look, can I take a message?

748
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,000
I've got news, my Lady.

749
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,100
Mr. Bromidge has rung. You've done it,
Gwen.  You got the job!

750
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,100
Oh... Take it! Take it!

751
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Something to celebrate?

752
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,700
I've got the job, Mrs. Hughes.
I'm a secretary.

753
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,000
I'm very happy for you, Gwen. And we'll
celebrate after we'll finish today's work.

754
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
Of course, Mrs. Hughes.

755
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:55,400
- I don't suppose...
            - Lady Sybil, Her Ladyship
     is asking after you.

756
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:08,000
Be careful, my lad, or your land up
with no job and a broken heart.

757
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,900
What do you mean?

758
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,200
      - I don't seem to be able 
to find your sister.
     - I wonder where she is.

759
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,300
Of course, she may have been cornered.

760
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:25,500
I've heard there is some old bore
she's trying to dodge.

761
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,500
Who's that?

762
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,700
I'm not sure... It's simply
ghastly, apparently.

763
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,800
But he promissed to propose today.

764
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:35,900
I can't tell you how funny she was when
it acted it out. Like she was on stage.

765
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,100
Really?

766
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,400
How amusing.

767
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,600
Well done, Mrs. Hughes.
Beautifuly executed, as always.

768
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,800
He is in the planning.

769
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,300
Mr. Carson, probably isn't the moment,
but I've just heard from Dr. Clarkson

770
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,020
that I've been accepted 
for a training scheme 
into the Army Medical Corps.

771
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,000
- Have you, indeed?
- Yes. I want to do it,
so I'll be handing in my notice.

772
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,900
I'll serve until the end
of the month, of course.

773
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,800
Thank you, Thomas.
We can talk about it later.

774
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:11,100
And you couldn't planned
that any better either!

775
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,500
- You can't be leaving yet!
- I'm afraid I must.

776
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Please, make my excuses
to your mother.

777
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,900
- I wish you'll come inside, my Lady.
- No.

778
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,300
People mustn't think I'm really ill.

779
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,400
I don't want to cast 
a dampener on the party.

780
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:17,700
Very well. But... are you sure you have
everything you need, my Lady?

781
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:26,900
Dear, O'Brien...
How sweet you are.

782
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,200
O'Brien!

783
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,200
Can I have a word? I need a favor
and I don't want to bother
Lady Grantham with it.

784
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,320
Certainly, my Lady.

785
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,800
She's been helping me find a new maid. 
And we had quite a few answers
from her advertisment.

786
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:51,800
Can you find where she'd put them
and get Branson to bring'em
to the Dowager House?

787
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,800
- Her Ladyship is helping you
find a new lady's maid?    - Yes!

788
00:56:54,801 --> 00:56:57,501
Which would (*) too, really.

789
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,700
You might take a look to
the letters, if you have a minute.

790
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,500
There's one who had been trained in Paris.

791
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,000
Do you know where she might put them?

792
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,700
The answers?

793
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Oh, yes, my Lady. There are only two
or three places there could be.

794
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Thank you, O'Brien.
You're a treasure. Thank you.

795
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:28,400
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

796
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,700
Pretty, though, isn't it?

797
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,400
Hard to believe the clouds are
gathering on a summer day like this.

798
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,800
Mr. Bates. I know you think
I was wrong to call on your mother.

799
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,700
I don't think that.

800
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,600
She likes you, by the way.

801
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,020
I had to find out the truth.

802
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,900
You see, you don't know
the whole truth.

803
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,300
Not even now.
You know my mother's truth.

804
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
But not your wife's.

805
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,800
- Where is she now?
- I couldn't tell you.

806
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
I'd better get back.

807
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,400
               - You're here, Mr. Molesley?
      I didn't know that.
- Just helping out.

808
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Nice girl, that Anna. It looks she's got
anyone special in her life.

809
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,800
I'd like to say she hasn't.

810
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,900
I would, surely, but I'm afraid
there is someone.

811
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,900
Do you think he's keen on her,
or is it worth a go?

812
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,500
Well, he keeps himself to himself.
It's very hard to read, at times, but...

813
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,900
I'd say he's keen...
I's say he's very keen, indeed.

814
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:44,980
Daisy, I've said ices, not ice cakes.

815
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,500
Now, unclog your ears and get these
to William before they turn into soup.

816
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,900
But I've tried to understand.
Nothing is changed.

817
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,280
Everything is changed.

818
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,700
You can't be sure I was going to
refuse you even if it fad been a boy.

819
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,000
- Because I'm not.
- That's the point!

820
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I can't be sure... Of you...
Or of everything, it seems.

821
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,700
Thew last few weeks have told me that.

822
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,400
- But you can't leave Downton.
- I can't stay. Not now.

823
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,600
What you'll tell Papa?

824
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,200
That I'm grateful for what he's trying to do...
but the experiment is at an end.

825
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,800
I'm not a puppet. I must
take charge of my own life again.

826
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,000
Would you have stayed...
if I'd accepted you?

827
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,400
- Of course.
- So, I've ruined everything?

828
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,600
You've showed me
I've been living in a dream.

829
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,400
And it's time to return to real life.

830
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,200
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

831
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:48,000
God knows I wish the best for you.

832
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,600
Well, Rosamund,
I'm afraid your medling

833
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,200
has cost Mary the only
decent offer she'll ever get.

834
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,000
I'm sorry, Mama, but you know me,
I have to say what I think.

835
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Why? Nobody else does.

836
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,200
- Are you quite well, my Lady?
- Of course.

837
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:36,300
You know me, Carson.
I'm never down for long.

838
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,700
I know you have spirit, my Lady.
That's what counts.

839
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,900
That's all that counts, in the end.

840
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,300
So, Mary is to be denied
her countess coronet, after all.

841
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:05,800
Don't crow at me. 
I think she was very foolish 
not to take Matthew when she could.

842
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,300
And I've told her so.

843
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:12,400
Well, if I'm perfectly honest,
I wonder if Matthew is making
the same mistake right now.

844
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,200
- Are you warm enough?
- I am when you're holding my hand.

845
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,200
- Your Lordship? This is
 just arrived for you.
- Thank you.                  

846
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,680
And I'm happy to tell you that
Thomas has just handed in his notice.

847
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:34,700
So, we'll be spared any
unpleasantness on that score.

848
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,800
What a relief!

849
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,600
Please! Would you stop, please?

850
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,000
My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen.
Can I ask for silence?

851
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,100
Because I very much regret to announce

852
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:08,100
that we are at war with Germany.

853

1
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,560
- When does it open?
- Tomorrow afternoon.

2
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,580
Well, let's get up a party, in the
evening. If Mrs. Hughes lets us.

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,550
- After we've had our dinner.
- You're right.

4
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,780
It doesn't come often.

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,080
- And it doesn't stay long.
- What about you, Mr. Bates?

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,650
I don't see why not.

7
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,290
There's Lady Mary.

8
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,380
You go on ahead. I'll
see you back at the house.

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,900
Right you are, then.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,930
Good day, milady.

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,180
Is her ladyship all right?

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,190
Has she recovered from...?

13
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,430
If you think she'll ever recover
from carrying the body of Mr. Pamuk

14
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,970
from one side of the house
to the other,

15
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,490
then you don't know her at all.

16
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,810
Well, I didn't mean
recover exactly. Just...

17
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,460
get past it.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,050
She won't do that,
either.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,110
When she dies they'll
cut her open and

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,890
find it engraved on her heart.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
What about you?

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,230
What about your heart?

23
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,660
Haven't you heard?

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,280
I don't have a heart.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,250
Everyone knows that.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,500
Not me, milady.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,640
You wanted to see the
new chauffeur, milord?

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,710
Yes, indeed. Please send him in.

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,650
Come in. Come in.
Good to see you again.

30
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,110
- Branson, isn't it?
- That's right, your lordship.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,710
I hope they've
shown you everything,

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,000
and delivered whatever
we promised at interview.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,230
Certainly, milord.

34
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,910
Won't you miss Ireland?

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,200
Ireland, yes, but not the job.

36
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,650
The mistress was a nice lady,

37
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,720
but she only had one car,

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,810
and she wouldn't let me drive
it over 20 miles an hour.

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,440
So, it was a bit...

40
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,990
well, boring, so to speak.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
You've got a wonderful library.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,970
You're very welcome to
borrow books, if you wish.

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,140
Really, milord?

44
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,200
There's a ledger that
I make everyone use,

45
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,520
even my daughters.

46
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,640
Carson and Mrs. Hughes
sometimes take a novel or two.

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,410
What are your interests?

48
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,950
History and politics, mainly.

49
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,850
Heavens.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,040
Carson, Branson is going
to borrow some books.

51
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,030
- He has my permission.
- Very good, milord.

52
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,700
Is that all, milord?

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
It is.

54
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,550
Off you go, and good luck.

55
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,320
He seems a bright spark
after poor old Taylor.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,420
And to think Taylor's
gone off to run a tea shop!

57
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,850
I cannot feel it will make for a
very restful retirement, can you?

58
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,600
I would rather be
put to death, milord.

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,390
Quite so. Thank you, Carson.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,670
How about some house parties?

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,750
She's been asked to one next
month by Lady Anne McNair.

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,360
That's a terrible idea. She
doesn't know anyone under 100.

63
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,060
I might send her to visit my aunt.

64
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,640
She could get to know New York.

65
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,970
Oh, I don't think things
are quite that desperate.

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,550
Poor Mary. She's been terribly
down in the mouth lately.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,600
She was very upset by the
death of poor Mr. Pamuk.

68
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,130
Why? She didn't know him.

69
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,970
One can't go to pieces at
the death of every foreigner.

70
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,540
We'd all be in a state of collapse

71
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,480
whenever we opened a newspaper.

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,540
Oh, no. Of course,
Mary's main difficulty

73
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,350
is that her situation
is unresolved.

74
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,300
I mean, is she an
heiress or isn't she?

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,860
The entail's unbreakable.
Mary cannot inherit.

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,140
No, what we need is a lawyer

77
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,990
who's decent and
honour-bound to look into it.

78
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,730
I... I think, perhaps,
I know just the man.

79
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,860
- Are you going to the fair?
- I shouldn't think so, sir.

80
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,560
But I don't mind
it. I like the music.

81
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,740
Goodness, what's
happened to your hands?

82
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,310
- It's nothing, ma'am.
- They look very painful.

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,220
Oh, no, ma'am. Irritating
more than painful.

84
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,130
Have you been using anything new
to polish the silver or the shoes?

85
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,090
- No.
- May I?

86
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,180
Leave him alone, Mother.

87
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,540
It looks like erysipelas.

88
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,050
- You must have cut yourself.
- Not that I'm aware of.

89
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,790
We'll walk to the
hospital tomorrow.

90
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,280
- Really, ma'am...
- I insist.

91
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
If you've got a cold,
I want you out of here.

92
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,980
Anna, they are. You
know I'm out tonight?

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,270
Because I don't want to
come home to any surprises.

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,500
That'll be the day.

95
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,780
We thought we might
go to the fair later.

96
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,880
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Daisy?

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,610
Now, you ought to go. She's
been that down in the mouth

98
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,150
since the death of poor Mr. Pamuk.

99
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,790
- Don't say that.
- Well, she has!

100
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,840
We could all walk down together
after the servants' dinner.

101
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,220
You won't be walking anywhere.

102
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,680
She's got minutes to
live, by the sound of it.

103
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,720
Go to bed at once.

104
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,180
Yes, Mrs. Hughes.

105
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,800
I'll bring up a Beechams powder.

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,860
Right, if there's anything
you want to ask me,

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,570
it'll need to be before I go.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,540
What would I want to ask you?

109
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,030
I'm preparing a meal for Lord
and Lady Grantham and the girls.

110
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,520
No-one is visiting.
No-one is staying.

111
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
Well...

112
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,410
that's settled, then.

113
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,230
I'm afraid Dr. Clarkson's
out delivering a baby.

114
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,720
We don't know when he'll be back.

115
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,930
No matter. If you open
the store cupboard,

116
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,750
I can easily find what I need.

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,910
- Well...
- You can tell the doctor

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,500
that you opened it for
the chairman of the board.

119
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,590
I assure you he will raise
not the slightest objection.

120
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,400
This should do it...

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,040
tincture of steel, 10 drops
in water three times a day.

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,980
And this is solution
of nitrate of silver.

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,090
Rub a little in morning and night.

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,330
How long before it's better?

125
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,420
Erysipelas is very hard to cure.

126
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,000
We should be able to reduce the
symptoms, but that might be all.

127
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,980
Oh, and you must wear
gloves at all times.

128
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,930
I couldn't...

129
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,840
wait a table in gloves
I'd look like a footman.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,100
You may have to do.

131
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,180
The tincture and
the salve will help.

132
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,940
Try it for a week, and we'll see.

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,340
Someone to see you, Mr. Crawley.

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,610
Well, there's nothing in my diary.

135
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
It's Lady Grantham.

136
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
Well, in that case,
show her in at once.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,040
Cousin Cora, to what do I owe the...

138
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,750
I hope I'm not a disappointment.

139
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,290
I thought it might be nice
to cheer it up a bit.

140
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,730
Easier said than done.

141
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,090
Perhaps a flower or a
bit of veil or something.

142
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,460
I can find you a veil, if you like.

143
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,750
I hope you're not
expecting ME to do it.

144
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,910
Not if you're busy, of course.

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Good.

146
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,860
And Miss O'Brian?

147
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,960
I've sent Anna to bed with a cold,

148
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,290
so I need you to manage
the young ladies.

149
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,540
What, all three of
them? I'm not an octopus.

150
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,750
Why can't Gwen do it?

151
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,190
Because she is not a lady's maid.

152
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,880
- I am not a slave.
- Just do it, Miss O'Brien.

153
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,390
Just do it.

154
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,800
I'll pay you the compliment that I
do not believe you wish to inherit

155
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,470
just because nobody's
investigated properly.

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,990
- No, but...
- Nor can Mary

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,320
accuse you of making trouble

158
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,050
when you will suffer
most from a discovery.

159
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,970
You're right that I don't wish
to benefit, at Mary's expense,

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,660
- from an ignorance of the law.
- Putting it bluntly,

161
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,450
do you think Robert has thrown
in the towel prematurely?

162
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,590
Good heavens! What am I sitting on?

163
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,320
A swivel chair.

164
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,680
- Another modern brainwave?
- Invented by Thomas Jefferson.

165
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,870
Why does every day involve
a fight with an American?

166
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,200
- I'll fetch a different one.
- No, no. No, no.

167
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,610
I'm a good sailor.

168
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,090
It will depend on
the exact terms

169
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,020
of the entail and
of the deed of gift

170
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,260
when cousin Cora's money
was transferred to the estate.

171
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,980
That is all I ask, to
understand the exact terms.

172
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Is Daisy going to the fair
tonight with the others?

173
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
Why don't you ask her?
She needs taking out of herself.

174
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,080
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

175
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Daisy, I was hoping...

176
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,250
Would you like to go to
the fair with me, Daisy?

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,110
There's a few of us going later on.

178
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,280
Do you mean it?

179
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,720
Daisy, don't let it get cold!

180
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,780
Come on, come on, come on!

181
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,690
You bastard.

182
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,130
Why is Sybil having a
new dress and not me?

183
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,880
Because it is Sybil's turn.

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,270
Can it be my choice this time?

185
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,630
Of course. As long as
you choose what I choose.

186
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,770
Branson, you'll be taking
Lady Sybil to Ripon tomorrow.

187
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,720
- She'll be leaving after lunch.
- Certainly, your ladyship.

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,880
Poor old Madam Swann.

189
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,780
I don't know why we
bother with fittings.

190
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,610
- She always makes the same frock.
- What do you want to make?

191
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,330
- Something new and exciting.
- Heavens, look at the time!

192
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,080
Not a minute to change.

193
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,380
And Granny's invited herself
for dinner.

194
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,030
Then, she can jolly well wait.

195
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,130
So, women's rights
begin at home? I see.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,920
Well, I'm all for that.

197
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,570
I'm just off, Mr. Carson.

198
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,500
According to the wine book,
we should have six dozen of this.

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,220
But I'm beggared if I
can find more than four.

200
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,280
Look again before you jump

201
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,980
to any nasty conclusions.

202
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,960
Long time since you
last took a night off.

203
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,780
- You don't think I ought to stay?
- Certainly not. Be off with you.

204
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,310
And Anna's in bed with a cold,

205
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,220
so I'm afraid it's all down to you.

206
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,430
Go.

207
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,360
I wanted to have a
go before I went home.

208
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,720
- How about you?
- Thank you.

209
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,110
Thank you.

210
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,540
Do you know is your father
doing anything this evening?

211
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,410
- He's not coming to the fair.
- Seriously.

212
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,110
We're having dinner
with his family.

213
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,840
Could I look in afterwards?

214
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,270
May I ask why?

215
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,310
Your grandmother paid me a
visit this afternoon, and I'm...

216
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,210
Well, never mind. But
I would like to see him.

217
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,990
Granny came to see you?

218
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,050
Is it all part of the great matter?

219
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,600
So, are you enjoying your new life?

220
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,200
Yes, I think so.

221
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,540
I know my work seems
very trivial to you.

222
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,280
Not necessarily.

223
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,280
Sometimes I rather envy you,

224
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,060
having somewhere
to go every morning.

225
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,390
I thought that may have
been very 'middle-class.

226
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,820
You should learn to
forget what I say.

227
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,010
I know I do.

228
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,890
How about you?
Is your life proving satisfactory?

229
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,370
Apart from the great
matter, of course.

230
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,330
Women like me don't have a life.

231
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,840
We choose clothes and pick halls

232
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,680
and work for charity
and do the season.

233
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,400
But, really, we're
stuck in a waiting room

234
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,760
until we marry.

235
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,390
I've made you angry.

236
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,780
My life makes me angry.
Not you.

237
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,020
I never put the Sauternes on ice.

238
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,670
Mrs. Hughes goes out for one
night and we all fall to pieces!

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,190
Mr. Carlson, we
wondered if we could walk

240
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,540
down to the fair after dinner.

241
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,750
I suppose so.

242
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,780
But don't be too late.

243
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,870
- Where do you think she's gone?
- None of your business.

244
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,670
Like most of what
goes on round here.

245
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,550
Well caught that man...
though I say it myself.

246
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,380
Thanks ever so.

247
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Yes?

248
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,030
- You've cheered up a bit.
- He's so agile, in't he?

249
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,470
He could have been
a sportsman.

250
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,620
Who?

251
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,170
- Thomas, of course.
- Really?

252
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,380
Which sport did he have in mind?

253
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,000
I ran into cousin Matthew
in the village.

254
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,940
He wanted to call
on you after dinner.

255
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,230
Apparently,
Granny's been to see him.

256
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,190
Did you tell him she's
coming here this evening?

257
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,430
I didn't know she was.

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,210
When he arrives, do your best

259
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,840
to keep her in the drawing room.

260
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,180
Well, I'd like to see you try.

261
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,270
<i>Don't stay too long.
Let them have an early night.</i>

262
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,880
Sybil, darling, why would you
want to go to a real school?

263
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,550
You're not a doctor's daughter.

264
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,920
Nobody learns anything
from a governess.

265
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,310
Apart from French
and how to curtsy.

266
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,660
What else do you need?

267
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,060
Well, there's...

268
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,090
Are you thinking of
a career in banking?

269
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,230
No. But it is a noble profession.

270
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,240
Things are different in America.

271
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,810
I know. They live in wigwams.

272
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,410
And when they come out of
them, they go to school.

273
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,130
If you wait in the library,
I'll tell Papa you're here.

274
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
Thank you.

275
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Elsie?

276
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,160
- It is Elsie, isn't it?
- It is.

277
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,940
Though there's very few left
to call me that, Joe Burns.

278
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,490
Well, I'm flattered
that I'm one of them.

279
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Where's Thomas?

280
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,080
I'm fear I let the servants
go down to the fair, milord.

281
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,430
I didn't know we'd have
any visitors tonight.

282
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, that's all right.
They don't have much fun.

283
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,260
You should join them.

284
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,420
So... what did you say to Mama?

285
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,890
I haven't spoken to her
since her visit,

286
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,980
but I have looked
through every source,

287
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,510
and I can't find one reason
on which to base a challenge.

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,390
I could have told you that.

289
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,310
I'm not quite sure how to

290
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,980
phrase it when
I tell her.

291
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,970
She shouldn't have put
you on the spot like that.

292
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,210
It was unkind.

293
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,790
I'm afraid she'll think I've failed

294
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,320
because I don't want to succeed.

295
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,610
She will think that, but
I don't. And nor will Cora.

296
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,570
Of course, it's
impossible for Mary.

297
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,490
She must resent me so bitterly.

298
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,060
I don't blame her.

299
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,860
Yes, it must have been
hard for you when Ivy died.

300
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,810
It took some getting used to.

301
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,700
What about your son?
Do you see much of him?

302
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,330
Peter? No.

303
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,740
I would have given him a share
of the farm if he wanted it,

304
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,490
but... he's joined the army.

305
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,140
Well, I never!

306
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,860
Aye, he seems happy.
But it's left me on my own.

307
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,710
- Shall I take your plates, then?
- Thank you.

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,380
- So, how's life treated you?
- Oh, I can't complain.

309
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,380
I haven't travelled.

310
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,680
But I've seen a bit of
life, and no mistake.

311
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,050
I notice you call yourself missus.

312
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,620
Housekeepers and cooks
are always missus.

313
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,380
You know better than anyone
I haven't changed my name.

314
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,530
Well, I know you wouldn't
change it to Burns

315
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,850
when you had the chance.

316
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,610
You shouldn't have eaten with us.

317
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,590
The chauffeur always eats
in his own cottage.

318
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,430
Steady on. You can cut him a
bit of slack on his second day.

319
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,140
I'm waiting to take
old Lady Grantham home.

320
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,030
Even then,
Taylor never ate with us.

321
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
You're taking advantage
of Mrs. Hughes' absence.

322
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,020
What are you doing?

323
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,150
I'm sorting the collars.

324
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
Removing the ones that
have come to an end.

325
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,270
What happens to his
lordship's old clothes?

326
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,720
What's it to you?

327
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,330
Clothes are a valet's
perk, not a chauffeur's.

328
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,480
I get some, but mostly it goes
into the missionary barrel.

329
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,480
I know it's meant to be kind,

330
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,010
but I can think of better
ways of helping the needy

331
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,160
than sending stiff
collars to the equator.

332
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,050
I thought Anna might have
come down for her dinner.

333
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,320
And show she's ready
to start work again?

334
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,550
Not a chance.

335
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,360
- Is she still in bed, then?
- She is.

336
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,450
While I'm sat here sewing like a

337
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,000
cursed princess in a fairy tale,

338
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,860
and not down at the
fair with the others.

339
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,120
Would you like me to ask Branson
to bring the car round, milady?

340
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,310
Where's Robert?

341
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,180
He can't have been
drinking port since we left.

342
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,930
He'd be under the table by now.

343
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,440
His lordship's in the library.

344
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,140
- All alone? Oh, how sad.
- No, he's...

345
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,790
We can say goodbye to
Papa for you, Granny.

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,290
He's what?

347
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,610
He's with Mr. Crawley, milady.

348
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,920
The question is, what do
I say to cousin Violet?

349
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,690
Don't worry about that.
I can handle her.

350
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,900
Really?

351
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,040
Well, if you can, you must
have learned to very recently.

352
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,660
<i>Anna?</i>

353
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Sr. Bates?

354
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,450
<i>Can you open the door?</i>

355
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
I daren't.

356
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,090
No-one can open that
door except Mrs. Hughes.

357
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,740
<i>Just for a moment. I've
brought you something.</i>

358
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,660
I don't know what...

359
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,690
What I don't understand
in all this is you.

360
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,800
You seem positively glad
to see Mary disinherited.

361
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,110
You speak as if we had a choice.

362
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,670
Thank you, Branson.

363
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,030
I'm worn out. Tell Lady Mary
and Mr. Crawley I've gone to bed.

364
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Shall I tell them now, milord?

365
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,610
No. Wait until they ring.

366
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,640
I like this one.

367
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,650
- Yes, sir?
- I ought to start back.

368
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,340
- This is very late for me.
- Aw, not yet.

369
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,710
It's a long time since I've had a

370
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,490
girl to show off for at the fair.

371
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,490
So, I take it you never get lonely?

372
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,070
Well, that's working
in a big house.

373
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,310
Though, there are times when
you yearn for a bit of solitude.

374
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,540
<i>We have a winner!</i>

375
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,180
Thank you.

376
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,030
Right, well, er... something
to remind you of me.

377
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,560
I don't need help to remember you.

378
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,540
But what happens when you retire?

379
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,650
I should think if I stay
here they'll look after me.

380
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,840
Suppose they sell the estate.

381
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,090
Suppose there's a tidal wave.

382
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,210
Suppose we all die of the
plague. Suppose there's a war.

383
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,820
What did I tell you?
She's found her Romeo.

384
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,390
He might be her brother.

385
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,610
She hasn't got one,
or we'd know.

386
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,780
Just a sister in Lytham St Anne's.

387
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,200
You know everything, don't you?

388
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,260
Everything my foot!

389
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,240
You're hiding behind him,

390
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,030
but he's not what you think he is.

391
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,620
Oh, go home, William.

392
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,440
If you're gonna be
such a spoilsport...

393
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,650
All right, I will.

394
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,610
Come back. She didn't mean it.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,170
I must go.

396
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,710
But... it's been lovely
to see you again, Joe.

397
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Really.

398
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,350
And you know what I'm asking?

399
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,960
You haven't asked anything yet.

400
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,660
But you know what it is? When I do.

401
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,150
I'm going to stop here at
the pub until I hear from you.

402
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,680
Oh, and take your time.

403
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,060
I'd rather wait a week
for the right answer, then...

404
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,450
get a wrong one in a hurry.

405
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,290
Think about it carefully.

406
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I will.

407
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,290
I promise you that.

408
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,340
To break the entail, we'd need

409
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,050
a private bill
in Parliament?

410
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,920
Even then, it would only be passed

411
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,380
if the estate were in danger,

412
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,600
which it's not.

413
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,330
And I mean nothing in all this?

414
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,080
On the contrary, you
mean a great deal.

415
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,100
A very great deal.

416
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,750
- You rang, milady?
- Yes, Carson.

417
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,060
Mr. Crawley was just leaving.

418
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,040
Do you know where his lordship is?

419
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,500
Gone to bed, milady.

420
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,560
He felt tired after he put
Lady Grantham into the car.

421
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,590
I bet he did. Thank you, Carson.

422
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,050
I'm sorry. I wish I could think of

423
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,660
something to say that would help.

424
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,810
There's nothing.

425
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,310
But you mustn't let it trouble you.

426
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,860
It does trouble me.

427
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,480
It troubles me very much.

428
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,980
Then, that will be
my consolation prize.

429
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,560
Good night, cousin Matthew.

430
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:54,460
Good night.

431
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,630
I hope I haven't
kept you up too late?

432
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,810
I'm afraid we've
interfered with your dinner.

433
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,720
It's been rather a
chop-and-change evening downstairs.

434
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,380
Lady Grantham got off all right?

435
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,030
"All right" is an optimistic
assessment, sir.

436
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,690
It's very difficult, Carson.

437
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,110
For her, for Lady Mary.

438
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,580
- For everyone.
- It is, Mr. Crawley.

439
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,680
But I appreciate your saying so.

440
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,780
Well, that's her greatness
done and dusted for the night.

441
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,160
Will, have you had a good night?

442
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,190
I'm off to bed.

443
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,350
Wait.

444
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,540
- What happened?
- Nothing. Doesn't matter.

445
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,090
How was your evening, Mrs. Hughes?

446
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,340
Very enjoyable, thank you.

447
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,060
The others are just behind me,

448
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,830
so you can lock up in a minute.

449
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,080
Well, I'll say good night.

450
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,620
- Good night, Mrs. Hughes.
- Good night.

451
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,990
Night, Mrs. Hughes.

452
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,160
Good night, Mrs. Hughes.

453
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,080
I was right when I said she
was looking sparkly eyed.

454
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,110
I beg your pardon, Thomas?

455
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,110
He can disapprove all he likes.

456
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,500
Mrs. Hughes has got a fancy man.

457
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,640
Him, a fancy man?

458
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,730
Don't be so nasty, Daisy.
It doesn't suit you.

459
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,580
I reckon there's a
job vacancy coming up.

460
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,840
Miss O'Brian,
do you fancy a promotion?

461
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,490
Very droll. If she's
got a boyfriend...

462
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,580
I'm a giraffe.

463
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,940
Leave me alone, Mr. Bates.

464
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,860
I know you mean well,
but let me be.

465
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,840
What chance did he have
up against a champion?

466
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,340
Well, you listen.

467
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,890
You filthy little rat.

468
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,740
If you don't lay off, I
will punch your shining teeth

469
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,590
through the back of your skull.

470
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,380
Is this supposed to
frighten me, Mr. Bates?

471
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,920
Because if it is, it isn't working.

472
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,770
I'm sorry, but it's
just not working.

473
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,760
Daisy? Chafing dishes now.

474
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,160
Right in front of
you, Mrs. Patmore.

475
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,420
Are you trying to trick me?

476
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,500
Anna's still not well. O'Brien,

477
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,160
you'll need to dress
the girls this morning.

478
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,920
All we know about Lady Mary,

479
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,760
and here I am waiting
on her hand and foot!

480
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,680
- Will we do anything with that?
- Maybe, but not yet.

481
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,690
What do you look like?

482
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,040
Daisy, what do you
think he looks like?

483
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,940
Do your buttons up.

484
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,540
Well, go on, then.

485
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
What do you want?

486
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,140
I've got a message
for Lady Sybil.

487
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,680
From her ladyship.

488
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,080
Thank you, O'Brien.
I'll manage now.

489
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,890
Odious woman.

490
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,990
What does Mama want?

491
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,980
I just said that to get rid of her.

492
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,090
This came today.

493
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,620
I knew they would want to see you.

494
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,520
It's your reference what's done it.

495
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,760
How am I going to get there?
They won't let me take a day off.

496
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,340
You're going to be ill.

497
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,020
They can't stop you being ill.

498
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,030
What?

499
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,250
No-one has seen
Anna for a whole day.

500
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,840
They won't notice if you
vanish for a couple of hours.

501
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,940
The only one who never sticks
up for me in all this is you.

502
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Why is that?

503
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,230
You are my darling
daughter, and I love you.

504
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,160
Hard as it is for an
Englishman to say the words.

505
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,470
Well, then.

506
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:54,230
If I had made my own fortune
and bought Downton myself,

507
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,340
it should be yours without question.

508
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
But I did not.

509
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,590
My fortune is the work of others

510
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,710
who laboured to
build a great dynasty.

511
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,640
Do I have the right
to destroy their work?

512
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,380
Or impoverish that dynasty?

513
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,470
I am a custodian, my
dear, not an owner.

514
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,809
I must strive to be worthy

515
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,780
of the task I've been set.

516
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,420
If I could take Mama's money
out of the estate,

517
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,470
Downton would have to be sold
to pay for it.

518
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,120
Is that what you want?

519
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,900
To see Matthew a landless peer

520
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,900
with a title but no
means to pay for it?

521
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,650
So, I'm just to find a
husband and get out of the way?

522
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,670
You could stay here
if you married Matthew.

523
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,920
You know my character, Father.

524
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,730
I'd never marry any
man that I was told to.

525
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,520
I'm stubborn. I wish
I wasn't, but I am.

526
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,690
Will you have your own way,
do you think? With the frock.

527
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,080
Only I couldn't help
overhearing yesterday.

528
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,540
And from what her ladyship said,

529
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,590
it sounded as if you
support women's rights.

530
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,100
I suppose I do.

531
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,990
Because I'm quite political.

532
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,520
In fact, I brought some pamphlets

533
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,720
that I thought might interest you.

534
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,080
About the vote.

535
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,940
Thank you.

536
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:35,000
But please don't mention this
to my father. Or my grandmother.

537
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,030
One whiff of reform, and she hears
the rattle of the guillotine.

538
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,980
It seems rather unlikely,
a revolutionary chauffeur.

539
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,990
Maybe.

540
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,280
But I'm a socialist,
not a revolutionary.

541
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,000
And I won't always be a chauffeur.

542
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,850
Mrs. Crawley. How nice.

543
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,820
You're busy. We
can come back later.

544
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,830
Molesley?

545
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,430
What are you doing
here? Are you ill?

546
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,380
Poor old Mr. Molesley.
How's it going?

547
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,670
The solution doesn't seem
to make it any better.

548
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,370
My imagination's running riot.

549
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,140
I've got erysipelas, your ladyship.

550
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,040
I am sorry.

551
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,910
Mrs. Crawley tells
me she's recommended

552
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,210
nitrate of silver
and tincture of steel.

553
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,740
Why, is she making a suit
of armour?

554
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,730
But I take it there's
been no improvement?

555
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,470
Not really.

556
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,160
And you're sure it's erysipelas?

557
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,340
That is Mrs. Crawley's
diagnosis.

558
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,950
What it is to have
medical knowledge.

559
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,900
It has its uses.

560
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,040
I see your father has been
making changes at home.

561
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,510
He has, milady. He's got
no use for the herb garden

562
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,250
now my mother's gone.

563
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,800
- And you've been helping him?
- I have.

564
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,630
Grubbing out the old rue hedge?

565
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,620
How did you know that?

566
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,690
Because this is not erysipelas.

567
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,820
This is a rue allergy.

568
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,800
If Molesley wears gardening gloves,

569
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,090
it'll be gone in a week.

570
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,840
Please don't think we're ungrateful

571
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,730
for your enthusiasm, Mrs. Crawley,

572
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,510
but... there comes a
time when things are best

573
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,280
left to the professionals.

574
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,310
- But I...
- And now I really,

575
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,620
I really must go.

576
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Good day.

577
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,200
Thank you, your ladyship.

578
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,790
I hope cousin Violet has
recovered from last night.

579
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,590
Whatever she says, my
mother is as strong as an ox.

580
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,130
It's high time she let go of her

581
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,370
scheme for upsetting everything.

582
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,690
Time we all did.

583
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,070
I can't deny I'm
pleased to hear it.

584
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,280
Are you beginning to
see a future here, then?

585
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,730
In a way, this business
has forced me to recognise

586
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,260
that I do want Downton
to be my future.

587
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,650
I'm glad.

588
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,970
You must have thought me an awful

589
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,880
prig when I first arrived.

590
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,210
Not a prig, just a man thrust into

591
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,220
something he never
wanted or envisaged.

592
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,670
I could only see the
absurdity of the whole thing.

593
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,110
- I'm sorry.
- Well, there are absurdities involved,

594
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,650
as I know well enough.

595
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,350
Possibilities, too.
And I was blind to them.

596
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,370
I was determined
not to let it change me.

597
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,600
It was absurd.
If you don't change, you die.

598
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,620
Do you think so?

599
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,940
I'm not sure. Sometimes
I think I hate change.

600
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,310
At least we can comfort ourselves
that this will still be here.

601
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,060
Because we saved it.

602
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,750
Thomas is lovely, in't he?

603
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,630
He's funny and handsome.

604
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,780
- He's got such lovely teeth.
- He's not for you, Daisy.

605
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,250
Course not. He's too good for me.
I know that.

606
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,670
No! He's not too good.

607
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,180
- What, then?
- He's not the boy for you,

608
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,550
and you're not the girl for him.

609
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,839
In't that what I just said?

610
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,450
And why would he be, when
he's seen and done so much,

611
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,970
and I've been nowhere
and done nothing?

612
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,420
Perhaps, Thomas has seen and
done more than is good for him.

613
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,840
He's not a lady's man.

614
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,640
- Well, in't it a blessed relief?
- Daisy!

615
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,480
Thomas is a troubled soul.

616
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,780
I don't know what you
mean, Mrs. Patmore.

617
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,940
Nothing.

618
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,560
I don't mean anything.

619
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,050
Except, if I don't get
the ice cream started,

620
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,940
they'll be dining at midnight.

621
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,840
Golly, my corset's tight.

622
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,040
Anna, when you've done that,
be an angel and loosen it a bit.

623
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,420
The start of the slippery slope.

624
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,620
I'm not putting on weight.

625
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,450
It didn't shrink in the draw.

626
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,740
Are you coming down?

627
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,010
I don't know why we
bother with corsets.

628
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,110
Men don't wear them, and they look

629
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,060
perfectly normal in their clothes.

630
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,330
- Not all of them.
- She's just showing off.

631
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,420
She'll be on about
the vote in a minute.

632
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,360
If you mean do I think
women should have the vote,

633
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,690
of course I do.

634
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,870
I hope you won't chain
yourself to the railings,

635
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,210
and end up being
force-fed semolina.

636
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,290
What do you think, Anna?

637
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,470
I think those women are very brave.

638
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,730
Hear-hear.

639
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,120
How did you get on
with your dressmaker?

640
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,280
- Find anything?
- I did.

641
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,680
And she says she can
have it done by Friday.

642
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,810
I'm sorry I couldn't come, but
I didn't want to put Matthew off.

643
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,920
EDITH: Were you pleased with
the work on the cottages?

644
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,670
I think they're making
a very good job of them.

645
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,170
You must all go and see.

646
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,740
You'll restore a few every year?

647
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,090
It was Matthew's idea.

648
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,040
Old crips was rather reluctant,

649
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,540
but I'm pleased we went forward.

650
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,160
- I suppose it's worth it.
- Of course it is.

651
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,570
Because of the people
who will live in them.

652
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,490
I be glad to hear
Matthew's conscience

653
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,330
is much more energetic than mine.

654
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,820
Excuse me, I'm going to
bed. I've rather a headache.

655
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,380
Of course.

656
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,180
- Should I bring you something for it?
- No, I'll be perfectly fine.

657
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,860
If I can just lie down.

658
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Mary.

659
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,100
Oh, my darling.

660
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,390
What is it?

661
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,250
You heard him,

662
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:21,740
"Matthew this, Matthew that,
Matthew, Matthew, Matthew!"

663
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,460
Oh, Mother, don't you see?

664
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,650
He has a son now. Of course he
didn't argue with the entail.

665
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:32,740
Why would he when he's
got what he always wanted?

666
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,650
Your father loves you very much.

667
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,020
He wouldn't fight for me, though.

668
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,170
Because he knew he couldn't win.

669
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,680
- You're no better.
- What?

670
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
You don't care that
Matthew gets everything,

671
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,590
because you don't
think I'm worthy.

672
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
Mary!

673
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,810
I wish you'd just
admit it.

674
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,210
I'm a lost soul to you.

675
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,790
I took lover with no thought
of marriage... a Turk!

676
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,030
Oh, think of that! Oh, my dear!

677
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,340
Don't worry, Mama.

678
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,250
You can go down now.

679
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,670
Everything will look
better in the morning.

680
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,420
Isn't that what you usually say?

681
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,560
I say it because it's usually true.

682
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,320
Papa will wonder where you are.

683
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,470
- Don't quarrel with Matthew.
- Why shouldn't I?

684
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,140
Because one day you may need him.

685
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,950
Oh, I see.

686
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,650
When I've ruined myself,

687
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,810
I must have a powerful
protector to hide behind.

688
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,440
I'd tell you off...

689
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,400
... but I like to hear you play.

690
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,540
- Where are they all?
- Busy, I suppose.

691
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,310
Haven't you got anything to do?

692
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,890
Yes, I have.

693
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,030
Of course I have.

694
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,980
You mustn't let
Thomas get you down.

695
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,720
He's just jealous.

696
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,990
Everyone likes you better than him.

697
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,700
Not everyone.

698
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,740
Then, she's a foolish girl,
and she doesn't deserve you.

699
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:52,960
Though, why am I encouraging you?

700
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,610
Forget all that for
10 years at least.

701
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,030
You're a kind woman, Mrs. Hughes.

702
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,390
I don't know how this house
would run without you.

703
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,100
I don't, truly.

704
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,140
Stopped flannelling and get on.

705
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,430
Before I betray you
to Mr. Carson.

706
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,780
Is there anything more
thrilling than a new frock?

707
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,670
I suppose not, milady.

708
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,560
You shall have one, too.

709
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,390
I thought this would be suitable
for your interview.

710
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,940
- I won't be wearing it, milady.
- Of course you will.

711
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,830
We have to make you look like

712
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,840
a successful, professional woman.

713
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,380
What is it? What's happened?

714
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,080
Well, I won't wear it
because I'm not going.

715
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,750
They've cancelled the appointment.

716
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,850
They found someone more
"suited for the post".

717
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,290
- And better qualified.
- This time.

718
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,860
Let's face it.

719
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,020
There will never be anyone
less suited for the post

720
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,770
or worse qualified than I am.

721
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,290
That isn't true.

722
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,620
You'll see. We're not giving up.

723
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,870
No-one hits the bull's-eye
with the first arrow.

724
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,990
I've put out the Rundle
candlesticks for dinner tonight.

725
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,650
Oh. I'm sorry. I'll
come back later.

726
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,010
No, stay. Please.

727
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,810
I've got something I'd
like to talk to you about.

728
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,330
If you've a minute.

729
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,950
Before I first came here
as head housemaid,

730
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,090
I was walking out with a farmer.

731
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,440
<i>When I told him I'd
taken a job at Downton,</i>

732
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,920
<i>he asked me to marry him.</i>

733
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,710
<i>I was a farmer's daughter from
Argyll, so I knew the life.</i>

734
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,820
He was very nice.

735
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,620
But then I came
here, and I did well,

736
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,640
and I didn't want to give
it up, so I told him no...

737
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,840
and he married someone else.

738
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,390
<i>She died three years ago,</i>

739
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,340
<i>and last month he wrote
asking to see me again.</i>

740
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,120
And I agreed, because all this time
I've wondered.

741
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,160
Go on.

742
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,680
I met him the other night.

743
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,910
We had dinner at the Grantham Arms,
and after, he took me to the fair.

744
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,860
And he was horrible
and fat and red-faced,

745
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,190
and you couldn't think
what you ever saw in him?

746
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,320
He was still a nice man.

747
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,920
He is still a nice man.

748
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,740
<i>Well, he was a bit red-faced,</i>

749
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,450
<i>and his suit was a little tight,</i>

750
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,680
<i>but none of that matters.</i>

751
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,670
In the real ways,
he hadn't changed.

752
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,280
And he proposed again...

753
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,720
and you accepted?

754
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,980
<i>In many ways, I wanted to accept.</i>

755
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,600
But I'm not that
farm girl any more.

756
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,270
I was flattered, of course, but...

757
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,480
... I've changed, Mr. Carson.

758
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,790
Life's altered you,
as it's altered me.

759
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,930
And what would be
the point of living

760
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,260
if we didn't let life change us?

761
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,650
You won't be leaving, then?

762
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,540
You'd better come. Mrs.
Patmore's on the rampage.

763
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,800
She wants the key to
the store cupboard.

764
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,960
You know how angry she
gets she hasn't got one.

765
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,330
Nor will she have, not
while I'm housekeeper here.

766
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,130
Leaving? When would
I ever find the time?

767
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,610
<i>... I have to go cap in
hand to Mary Queen of Scots!</i>

768
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,280
Whatever is holding Sybil up?

769
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,430
She was going on
about her new frock.

770
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,150
We'd better go in without her,

771
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,060
or it's not fair on Mrs. Patmore.

772
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,950
Oh, is her cooking
so precisely timed?

773
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,650
You couldn't tell.

774
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,210
I think her food is delicious.

775
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,180
Naturally.

776
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,380
Good evening, everyone.

777
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,860
Why should you be burdened
with Mary's secret?

778
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,720
There's a rumour in London
that you are not virtuous.

779
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,480
I wish you'd just come out with it.

780
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,490
With what?

781
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,240
Whatever it is
you're keeping secret.

782
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:52,330
Isn't it possible I should
win the thing on merit?

783
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:55,240
I think the appropriate
answer to that is: "Yes, dear".

784
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,850
- Maybe I'll shine by comparison.
- Maybe you will.

785
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,660

Episode 3

4
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,979
There you are, Mr. Bates,
it's in. Came this morning.

5
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,299
They said it would,
which isn't quite the same thing.

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,819
Hello.

7
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,979
I could have posted that for you.

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,939
Well, I prefer to do it myself.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,459
I'll wait outside.

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,879
What are you doing?

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,579
If you must know, I'm trying to find
some space on top of the cupboard,

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,539
to make life easier.

13
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,539
- So what's in it, then?
- What?

14
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,059
The bleedin' great packing case
that weighs a ton, that's what.

15
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,739
Can you just leave it?

16
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,479
No I can't and you'll
tell me right now.

17
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,219
- Anything interesting?
- Not particularly.

18
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,099
It's from Evelyn Napier.

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,441
You met him with the
Delderfields last November

20
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,430
- at Doncaster Races.
- Is that Lord Branksome's boy?

21
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:54,859
- It is.
- Do you like him?

22
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,619
I don't dislike him.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,259
- And what's he writing about?
- Nothing much.

24
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,379
He's out with the York
and Ainsty next week.

25
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,599
The meet is at Downton. He
wants some tea when he's up here.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,579
Where's he staying? With friends?

27
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,259
He says he's found a pub
that caters for hunting.

28
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,339
Well, we can improve on that.

29
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,699
He must come here. He can send
the horses up early, if he wants.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,739
He'll know why you're asking him.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,579
I can't think what you mean.
His mother's a friend of mine.

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,299
She'll be pleased at the idea.

33
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,939
Not very pleased... she's dead.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,899
All the more reason, then.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,139
You can write a note too
and put it in with mine.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,259
Should I tell him about your
friendship with his late mother?

37
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,299
I'm sure you of all people can
compose a letter to a young man

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,219
without any help from me.

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,979
- How much did it cost?
- Every penny I'd saved.

40
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,019
Or, almost.

41
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,919
And...is this the mystery lover?

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,299
I've been taking a correspondence
course in typing and shorthand.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,619
That's what was in the envelopes.

44
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,539
Are you any good?

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,179
Yes.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,339
I am, actually.

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,979
Her Ladyship wants the fawn
skirt Lady Mary never wears.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,459
Her seamstress is going to fit it
to Lady Sybil, but I can't find it.

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,259
I'll come in a minute.

50
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,539
They're waiting now. One minute.

51
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,919
I'm just changing my cap and apron.

52
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,139
Have you told anyone?

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,707
What did your parents say?

54
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,859
Well, I can't tell them
till I've got a job.

55
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,459
Dad will think I'm a fool
to leave a good place,

56
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,259
and Mum will say
I'm getting above myself, but...

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,299
but I don't believe that.

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,899
Nor do I.

59
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,759
It's not of my doing.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,399
It's all Mary's own work,
but I think we should encourage it.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,199
Branksome's a dull dog,
but I don't suppose that matters.

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,079
- Did you know his wife had died?
- He only ever talks about racing.

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,759
Cora is right.

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,079
Mary won't take Matthew Crawley,

65
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,259
so we'd better get her settled,

66
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,739
before the bloom is quite gone
off the rose.

67
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,779
Is the family an old one?

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,219
Older than yours, I imagine.

69
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,419
- Old enough.
- And there's plenty of money.

70
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,099
Really?

71
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,339
Mama, you've already looked him up
in the stud books

72
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,539
and made enquiries about the
fortune, don't pretend otherwise.

73
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,759
Are you afraid someone will think
you're American if you speak openly?

74
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,619
I doubt it'll come to that.

75
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,699
- Shall I ring for tea?
- No, not for me.

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,379
I'm meeting Cripps at five.

77
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,319
I'll see you at dinner.

78
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,859
You don't seem very pleased.

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,059
I'm pleased.

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,119
It's not brilliant, but I'm pleased.

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,421
So...?

82
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:40,259
I don't want Robert
to use a marriage

83
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,059
as an excuse to stop fighting for
Mary's inheritance.

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,019
It won't make any difference.

85
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,859
I don't think he has the slightest
intention of fighting as it is.

86
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,939
The price of saving Downton is to
accept Matthew Crawley as his heir.

87
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,579
What about you?

88
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,019
I don't dislike Matthew

89
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,379
in fact, I rather admire him.

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,499
Is that sufficient reason
to give him your money?

91
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,099
Of course not. Then there's nothing
more to be said.

92
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,739
Are we going to have tea or not?

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,139
Hello.

94
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,379
I'd offer you a lift, if I could.

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,539
It was you I was coming to see.

96
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,859
Then, your timing is matchless.
I've just got off the train.

97
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,059
The other day at dinner,

98
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,499
cousin Isobel was saying you wanted
to see some of the local churches.

99
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,259
She's right, I do.

100
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,299
I want to know more about the county
generally if I'm to live here.

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,179
Well, I thought I might show you
a few of the nearer ones.

102
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,139
We could take a picnic and make an
outing of it.

103
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,299
- That's very kind.
- Nonsense, I'll enjoy it.

104
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,259
It's too long since I played
the tourist.

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,499
Well, it would have
to be a Saturday.

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,019
Churches work on Sunday and I work
all the weekdays. [GÊ COMEÇA AQUI]

107
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,499
Then, Saturday it is.

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,839
I'll get Lynch to sort out the
governess cart

109
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,699
and I'll pick you up at about 11.

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,939
How does it work? It's easy.

111
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,979
You just press the letters
and they print on the paper.

112
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,259
Get back, please.

113
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,819
They were trying to hide it,
so I knew it was wrong.

114
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,899
Where's Gwen now?

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,819
Doing the dining room with Anna.
They'll be finished soon.

116
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,799
Then I'll wait.

117
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,259
With all due respect, Mr. Carson,
Gwen is under my jurisdiction.

118
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,999
Indeed she is, Mrs. Hughes,

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,779
and I have no intention of
usurping your authority.

120
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,019
I merely want to get to
the bottom of it.

121
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,239
Why shouldn't Gwen
have a typewriter?

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,779
- Mind your own business.
- What's that doing here?

123
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,579
Gwen, come in.

124
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,099
Why is that down here? Who's been
in my room? They had no right.

125
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,579
See, in the first place, none of the
rooms in this house belong to you.

126
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,339
And, in the second, I am in charge
of your welfare,

127
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,499
- and that gives me every right.
- This is you, isn't it?

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,579
All we want is to know what Gwen
wants with a typewriter

129
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,819
and why she feels the need
to keep it secret.

130
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,139
She wants to keep it private,
not secret.

131
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,979
- There's a difference.
- Amen.

132
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,079
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,488
I've bought a typewriter

134
00:07:09,489 --> 00:07:12,119
and I've taken a postal
course in shorthand.

135
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,599
I'm not aware that either
of these actions is illegal.

136
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,739
Will you tell us why?
Preferably without any more cheek.

137
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,579
Because I want to leave service.

138
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,979
I want to be a secretary.

139
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,339
You want to leave service?

140
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,699
- What's wrong with being in service?
- Nothing's wrong with it

141
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,459
and there's nothing wrong with
mending roads neither,

142
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,779
but it's not what I want to do.

143
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,539
I should remind you that
there are plenty of young girls

144
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,659
who would be glad of a position
in this house.

145
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,679
When I hand in my notice,
I shall be happy to think one of
them will be taking my place.

146
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,619
What makes you think
we'll wait till then?

147
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,079
Are you hiring and sacking now,
Miss O'Brien?

148
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,519
I thought that lay with Mr. Carson
and Mrs. Hughes.

149
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,779
Enough of this. I'm going to ring
the dressing gong

150
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,759
and we'll have no more talk of this
tonight.

151
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,119
Can I have my machine back now?

152
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,959
Very well, but I wish I was sure
you know what you're doing.

153
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,839
Daisy, what's happened to you?

154
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,679
I said you could go for
a drink of water,

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,639
not a trip up the Nile.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,039
Which churches will you show him?

157
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,259
I can't decide.

158
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,699
Kirby, possibly,
or perhaps Easingwold.

159
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,179
You don't think you're being
a bit obvious?

160
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,339
Coming from you, that's rich.

161
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,979
There was a letter from Mr. Napier
in the evening post.

162
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,679
- Did he accept?
- Not yet.

163
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,119
Perhaps he thought it was
too obvious.

164
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,779
Apparently he's bringing a friend
with him,

165
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,859
an attache at the Turkish Embassy.

166
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,379
A Mr. Kemal Pamuk.

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,859
He's the son of one of the sultan's
ministers

168
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,139
and he's here for the Albanian talks.

169
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,139
- What's that?
- To create an independent Albania.

170
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,805
Don't you read the papers?
I'm too busy living a life.

171
00:08:54,806 --> 00:08:56,579
Since Turkey's signature is vital,

172
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,419
Mr. Napier's been given the job of
keeping him happy

173
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,419
until the conference begins.

174
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,699
He's eager to try an English hunt.

175
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,059
I shall invite this Mr. Pamuk
to stay here as well.

176
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,219
Who knows? A little hospitality
in an English house

177
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,499
may make all the difference
to the outcome.

178
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,779
And, Mary,
you will ride out with him.

179
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,859
Oh, Mama, must I?

180
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,779
My boots are at the menders
and I haven't ridden for weeks.

181
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,059
Anna, please see that Lady Mary
is fully equipped to go hunting.

182
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,019
Yes, Your Ladyship.

183
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,339
Yes?

184
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,999
I saw this advertisement
for a limp corrector.

185
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,120
Yes?

186
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,499
What does it do, exactly?

187
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,579
It corrects limps.

188
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,759
- Does it work?
- Well, as I make it and I advertise it,

189
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,899
is it likely I'd say no?

190
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,859
Could I see one?

191
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,339
Here we are.

192
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,779
You adjust this to the right height,
to minimise the limp.

193
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,419
You tighten these, gradually,
as tight as you can stand.

194
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,339
As the leg straightens,
the foot lowers to the floor.

195
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,959
Can't say it's gonna be easy
and you can't slack.

196
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,299
Every day, all day,
if you mean business.

197
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,639
All right.

198
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,699
How much?

199
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,339
She asks if we can both dine
on Saturday.

200
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,419
There are two young men staying,

201
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,699
so you won't be so outnumbered
for once.

202
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,699
What men?

203
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,299
A Turkish diplomat called...
something I can't read

204
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,299
and Lord Branksome's charming son,

205
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,979
who's to be flung at Mary,
presumably.

206
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,859
When it comes to cousin Mary,

207
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,539
she's quite capable of doing
her own flinging, I assure you.

208
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,819
Open the door, can you?

209
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,141
I couldn't find
her britches anywhere,

210
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:21,819
so I asked Mr. Bates.

211
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,339
He looked among
His Lordship's riding clothes.

212
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,219
There they were.

213
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,619
I only hope to God
I've got everything.

214
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,579
Hat, I'll do here.

215
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,059
Gloves and crop are in the hall.

216
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,059
Gwen?

217
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,339
Whatever's the matter?

218
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,019
Hey, come on. Sit down.

219
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,139
Hey.

220
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,779
What's up? Oh...

221
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,339
I'm just being silly.

222
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,859
You should get that brushed.

223
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,539
He won't be up for another
half an hour, now what is it?

224
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,339
I suppose I've just realised
that it's not going to happen.

225
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,659
- What isn't?
- Well, none of it.

226
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,239
I'm not going to be a secretary.

227
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,019
I'm not going to leave service.

228
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,699
I doubt I'll leave here
before I'm 60.

229
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,819
Hey, what's all this?

230
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,699
You saw their faces.

231
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,579
And they're right.

232
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,299
Oh, look at me.

233
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,779
I'm the daughter of a farmhand.

234
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,619
I'm lucky to be a maid.

235
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,379
I was born with nothing
and I'll die with nothing.

236
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,459
Don't talk like that.

237
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,699
You can change your life
if you want to.

238
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,539
Sometimes, you have to be hard on
yourself,

239
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,579
but you can change it completely,
I know.

240
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,819
Mr. Bates, are you all right?

241
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,759
Take her upstairs.

242
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,739
Dry her off.

243
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,819
Come on, Gwen.

244
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,579
Mr. Bates, what's the matter?

245
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,979
Nothing. Not a thing. I'm fine.

246
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,939
- Let me help you.
- I'm perfectly all right, thank you, Mrs. Hughes.

247
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,899
Are you sure?

248
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,979
You're as white as a sheet.

249
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,619
It's my wonderful complexion,
inherited from my Irish mother.[]

250
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,759
Take it. Take it. Don't dawdle.

251
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,719
His Lordship... William...

252
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,919
Sir.

253
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,599
Very good.

254
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,119
- Can you see them, milady?
- Not yet.

255
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,239
Oh, wait a minute.
Here's Mr. Napier.

256
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,959
I was beginning to give up on you.

257
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,767
- We're moving off.
- We were fools not to accept

258
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,159
your mother's invitation and
send the horses down early.

259
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,679
My groom only got here
an hour or two ago,

260
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,519
my mount's as jumpy
as a deb at her first ball.

261
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,099
What about Mr. Pamuk?

262
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,159
I gather, if he takes a tumble,
you'll be endangering world peace.

263
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,039
Don't worry about Kemal,
he knows what he's doing on a horse.

264
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,039
- Well, where is he?
- Fussing.

265
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,299
He's rather a dandy.

266
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,759
I can see him now, a funny little
foreigner, with a wide, cheeky grin

267
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,519
and hair reeking of pomade.
I wouldn't quite say that.

268
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,599
Here he is now.

269
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,879
Lady Mary Crawley, I presume.

270
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,099
You presume right.

271
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,859
Sorry to be so dishevelled.

272
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,819
We've been on a train since dawn
and we had to change in a shed.

273
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,779
You don't look dishevelled to me.

274
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,859
- Lynch, you don't have to stay with me.
- But His Lordship asked me to.

275
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,359
It's a waste of your day.

276
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,479
Help Mr. Napier's man get
their things back to the house.

277
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,519
- His Lordship said
- Don't worry, I'll look after her.

278
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,039
We'll make it our business
to keep her from harm, I promise.

279
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,679
I hope the day is living up to
your expectations.

280
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,679
It's exceeding them in every way.

281
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,559
- And where's Mr. Napier?
- He's gone over the bridge, look.

282
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,999
And what about you?
Will you follow him?

283
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,959
Or will you come over the jump
with me?

284
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,559
I was never much one
for going round by the road.

285
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,119
Stay by me and we'll take it
together.

286
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,899
I wish we could talk a little more
about you.

287
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,599
What was it like?

288
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,679
Growing up in Manchester?

289
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,079
Does it say anything about
the side aisles?

290
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,159
The side aisles were added in the
14th century

291
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,439
by...Bishop Richard De Warren.

292
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,839
Yes, you can see that in the
treatment of the stone.

293
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,959
It's wonderful to think of all those
men and women

294
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,879
worshipping together through the
centuries, isn't it?

295
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,239
Dreaming and hoping...

296
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,039
Much as we do, I suppose.

297
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,199
Was the screen a Cromwell casualty?

298
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,459
I daresay.

299
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,199
I wonder how Mary's getting on.

300
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,919
All right, I should think.

301
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,239
- Why?
- Oh, I just wondered.

302
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,439
Will she stay with
the hunt the whole day?

303
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,479
You know Mary.

304
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,959
She likes to be in at the kill.

305
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,079
Where shall we go next?

306
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,639
- Not home?
- Not yet.

307
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,839
We've time for one more, at
least, before we lose the light.

308
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,879
I underestimated your enthusiasm.

309
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,139
Come on.

310
00:19:00,202 --> 00:19:01,508
Is that one mine?

311
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,959
"Home is the hunter,
home from the hill".

312
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,159
Heavens, you have been in the wars.

313
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,359
Papa, this is Mr. Pamuk.

314
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,079
- My father, Lord Grantham.
- How do you do, milord?

315
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,759
- Did you have a good day?
- Couldn't have been better.

316
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,719
This is Thomas, sir.
He'll be looking after you.

317
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,051
- You remember Mr. Napier.
- Of course. How are you?

318
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:25,139
So kind of you to
have us, Lady Grantham.

319
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,879
And this is Mr. Pamuk.

320
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,199
- How do you do?
- Milady.

321
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,919
Well, what would you like?

322
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,039
Just baths, we're worn out.

323
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,759
Your cases are upstairs, sir.

324
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,519
- If you'd like to follow me...
- Yes.

325
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,759
<i>Well, I hope Mary hasn't left
you too exhausted, Mr. Napier.</i>

326
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,159
<i>No.</i>

327
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,679
He doesn't look Turkish at all.

328
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,074
He doesn't look like any
Englishman I've ever met.

329
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:56,679
Worse luck.
I think he's beautiful.

330
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,027
Is there some crisis,
of which I am unaware?

331
00:20:01,028 --> 00:20:02,328
No, Mr. Carson.

332
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:05,127
I cannot think of another reason
why you should congregate here.

333
00:20:05,128 --> 00:20:07,122
No, Mr. Carson.

334
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,299
Have you seen our visitor?
Quite a treat for the ladies.

335
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,600
Indeed, milord.

336
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:15,573
- Are they settled in all right?
- I believe so.

337
00:20:15,574 --> 00:20:17,639
Mr. Napier's valet
seems competent fellow

338
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,959
and Thomas knows what he's doing.

339
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,479
Why doesn't the gorgeous
Turk have his own chap?

340
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,639
Apparently his man
speaks no English,

341
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,599
so Mr. Pamuk decided
to leave him in London.

342
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,031
Probabily was very wise.
I hope Thomas doesn't mind.

343
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:30,479
You know Thomas, milord.
He has to have a grumble,

344
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,759
but he cheered up when
he saw the gentleman.

345
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,119
- Bates, is anything wrong?
- Nothing at all, milord.

346
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,079
Is that strap too tight?

347
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,839
Shall I adjust it, sir?

348
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,899
Now, I'm relying on you to see that
I go downstairs properly dressed.

349
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,236
Don't worry, sir.

350
00:20:51,237 --> 00:20:53,648
I've got sharp eyes for
anything out of order.

351
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:55,587
Then I put yourself
entirely in your hands.

352
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,132
You do right, sir.

353
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,284
I should love to visit Turkey.

354
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,415
Yes, it's a... a wonderful country.

355
00:21:10,956 --> 00:21:12,976
My man always does this.
Can you...?

356
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:20,614
I'm very... attracted
to the Turkish culture.

357
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,463
Then I hope your chance
will come to sample it.

358
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:27,032
I hope so too.

359
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,479
You forget yourself?!

360
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,559
I-I'm sorry, sir, I...

361
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,039
That will teach you to believe what
the English say about foreigners.

362
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,119
I ought to report you.

363
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,059
- I think you must ha...
- I mistook nothing.

364
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,732
But... I will make you an offer.

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,234
Later tonight, I may
need some help with the...

366
00:21:54,374 --> 00:21:55,967
geography of the house.

367
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,713
- The geography?
- Yes.

368
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:02,006
I'm not sure yet, but I may
wish to pay someone a visit.

369
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:04,937
If that is the case,
you will help me.

370
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,319
And I will say nothing
of your behaviour.

371
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,639
I don't understand. Why would
she want to be a secretary?

372
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,719
She wants a different life.

373
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,799
But why?

374
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,639
I should far prefer to be a maid
in a large and pleasant house

375
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,699
than work from dawn till dusk
in a cramped and gloomy office.

376
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,479
- Don't you agree, Carson?
- I do, milady.

377
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,399
Why are we talking about this?
What does it matter?

378
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,359
It matters that the people that
live and work here are content.

379
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,879
Of course. We should be helping
Gwen, if that's what she wants.

380
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,759
I agree. Surely we must all
encourage those less fortunate

381
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,719
to improve their
lot where they can.

382
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,879
Not if it isn't in
their best interests.

383
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,479
Isn't the maid a better
judge of that than we are?

384
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,439
What do you say, Mr. Pamuk?

385
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,639
Should our housemaid
be kept enslaved,

386
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,719
or forced out into the world?

387
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,079
Why are you English so curious
about other people's lives?

388
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,239
If she wishes to leave, and the
law permits it, then... let her go.

389
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,319
Perhaps the law should not
permit it, for the common good.

390
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,399
So you hanker for
the days of serfdom.

391
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,839
I hanker...for a simpler world.

392
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,879
Is that a crime?

393
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,959
I do dream of a simpler world,

394
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,719
as long as we can keep
our trains and our dentistry.

395
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,639
I wish I shared your enthusiasm.

396
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,159
- Our dentist is horrid.
- Why go to him, then?

397
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,519
He treated all of us
when we were children.

398
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,039
You know how the English
are about these things.

399
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,199
<i>... success at the Grand National.</i>

400
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,879
<i>Yes, indeed, second.</i>

401
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,039
Well, the next time
you feel a twinge,

402
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,079
you must come to Istanbul.

403
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,759
Wouldn't the journey be painful?

404
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,399
Sometimes we must endure
a little pain

405
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,359
in order to achieve satisfaction.

406
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,199
Lady Mary rode very well today.

407
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,299
Why did you send Lynch back?

408
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,859
I had my champions to left
and right. It was enough.

409
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,139
Did you enjoy the
hunt today, Mr. Napier?

410
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,379
Mary said you had a tremendous run.

411
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,939
It was like something out of
a Trollope novel.

412
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,219
And what about you, Mr.
Pamuk? Was your day successful?

413
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,379
Oh, yes, Lady Grantham. I can
hardly remember a better one.

414
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,179
Mary has more suitors tonight
than the Princess Aurora.

415
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,099
But will she judge them sensibly?

416
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,339
No-one's sensible at her age, nor
should they be. That's our role.

417
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,819
Well, if you'll excuse me...
Thank you.

418
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,339
Is it fun to be back in the saddle?

419
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,859
Yes, although I'll pay for it
tomorrow.

420
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,179
Would you ever come out with me?

421
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,112
Or aren't we friends
enough for that?

422
00:24:45,147 --> 00:24:46,633
Oh, I think it might be...

423
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:49,559
That run reminded me of a day
last month, up in Cheshire.

424
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,959
- We came down the side of a hill...
- Excuse me.

425
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,599
It seems we must brush up
on our powers of fascination.

426
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,599
- I was a fool to bring him here.
- Don't you like him?

427
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,319
Well, I like him very much, but so does
everyone else, unfortunately.

428
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,879
Excuse me.

429
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,559
I hope I didn't
wear you out, today.

430
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,479
Not at all. I enjoyed it.

431
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,919
We must do it again.

432
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,599
Next time, let's take my mother.

433
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,999
She was so jealous, she made me
promise she could come with us.

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,799
<i>Of course. How nice that would be.</i>

435
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,900
What is it?

436
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,310
Is this picture really
a Della Francesca?

437
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,479
I think so. The second Earl brought
back several paintings from...

438
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,479
Mr. Pamuk.

439
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,052
Let me come to you tonight, please.

440
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,640
I can't think what I have said
that has led you to believe

441
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,559
I don't know when we'll meet again,

442
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,739
so let it be tonight.

443
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:59,619
Mr. Pamuk, I will not repeat
your words to my father,

444
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,419
since I should hate to see you cast
out into the darkness,
[CRIS COMEÇA AQUI]

445
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,939
but can we agree to consider them
unsaid?

446
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,539
Now, if you'll excuse me, I shall
rejoin my mother and sisters.

447
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,919
You must be mad.

448
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,599
I am. I am in the grip of madness.

449
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,639
Please leave at once, or I'll...

450
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,299
Or you'll what?

451
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,039
I'll scream.

452
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,079
No you won't.

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,439
Well, I'll ring the bell, then.

454
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,679
And who's on duty now? The hall boy?

455
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,479
Will you let him really find a man
in your bedroom? What a story.

456
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,879
Do you have any idea
what you're asking?

457
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,879
I'd be ruined if they even knew
we'd had this conversation,

458
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,959
- let alone if
- What?

459
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,079
Don't worry, you'll still be
a virgin for your husband.

460
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,719
Heavens, is this a proposal?

461
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,319
Alas, no, I don't think our union
would please your family.

462
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,159
I'm afraid not.

463
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,199
Nor mine.

464
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,239
But...

465
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,199
a little imagination...

466
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,359
You wouldn't be the first.

467
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,239
You and my parents
have something in common.

468
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,399
You believe I'm much more of a rebel
than I am.

469
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,319
Now, please go.

470
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,719
I'm not what you think I am.

471
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,580
If it's my mistake, if I've
led you on, I'm sorry, but...

472
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,839
- I'm not.
- You are just what I think you are.

473
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,759
No.

474
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,799
I've never done anything.

475
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,839
Of course not.

476
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,099
One look at you would tell me that.

477
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,959
Oh, my darling.

478
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,119
Won't it hurt?

479
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,759
Is it safe?

480
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,719
Trust me.

481
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,899
He's dead. I think he's dead.

482
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,259
No, I'm sure he's dead.

483
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,979
But how?

484
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,939
We were together and...

485
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,659
He's dead.

486
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,619
In your room?

487
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,857
We've got to get him
back to his own bed. But how?

488
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:14,339
It's in the Bachelor's Corridor,
miles from my room.

489
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,059
Could we manage it between us?

490
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,699
He weighs a ton.
I could hardly shift him at all.

491
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,419
We'll need at least one other.
What about Bates?

492
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,459
He couldn't lift him.

493
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,779
William can't keep a secret.

494
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,499
And Thomas wouldn't try to.

495
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,179
We've got to do something.

496
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,699
Who else has as much to lose as you
if it ever gets out?

497
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,623
Not Papa. Please don't say Papa.

498
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:41,079
- I couldn't bear the way he'd look at me.
- No, not His Lordship.

499
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,979
- What happened?
-  I don't know.

500
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,099
A heart attack, I suppose,
or a stroke or...

501
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,219
He was alive and suddenly, he cried
out, and then he was dead.

502
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,819
But why was he here at all?

503
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,779
Did he force himself on you?

504
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,519
Well...we can talk about that later.

505
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,979
Now...we must decide what to do
for the best.

506
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,939
There's only one thing we can do.

507
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,659
I couldn't. It's not possible.

508
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,979
If you don't, we will figure in
a scandal of such magnitude,

509
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,899
it will never be forgotten until
long after we're both dead.

510
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,219
I'll be ruined, Mama.
Ruined and notorious.

511
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,299
A laughing stock, a social pariah.

512
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,739
Is that what you want for
your eldest daughter?

513
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,899
Is it what you want for the family?

514
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,619
We must cover him up.

515
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,259
Hurry.
The servants will be up soon.

516
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:51,577
We've got time.

517
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,299
- Mama.
- Sorry.

518
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,499
I can't make his eyes stay shut.

519
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,459
Leave that and come away.

520
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,459
He was so beautiful.

521
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,499
Her Ladyship's right.

522
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,699
We must get back to our rooms.

523
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,859
I feel that I can never forgive what
you have put me through this night.

524
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,059
I hope, in time, I will come to be
more merciful,

525
00:31:57,533 --> 00:31:59,099
but I doubt it.

526
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,179
You won't tell Papa?

527
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,099
Since it would probably kill him and
certainly ruin his life, I will not,

528
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,559
but I keep the secret for his sake,
not for yours.

529
00:32:09,068 --> 00:32:10,399
Yes, Mama.

530
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:12,895
Anna.

531
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,499
I will not insult you

532
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,879
by asking that you also conceal
Lady Mary's shame.

533
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,239
Let us go.

534
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,519
I imagine you've heard
what's happened?

535
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,559
Yes.

536
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,599
A terrible thing.

537
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,639
Awful.

538
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,599
Ghastly for your parents.

539
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,699
I don't suppose I shall ever
make it up to them.

540
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,339
Well, it wasn't your fault.

541
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,379
I brought him here.

542
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,599
If it isn't my fault, whose is it?

543
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,519
I was wondering if you might
show me the gardens before I go.

544
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,199
We could get some fresh air.

545
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,199
I won't, if you'll forgive me.

546
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,259
I ought to stay and help Mama.

547
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,839
Of course.

548
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,879
I'm so sorry about all this.

549
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,059
I told your father I'll deal with
the Embassy.

550
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,479
They won't be any more annoyance
for you.

551
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,039
Thank you.

552
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,559
Actually, he was a terribly nice
fellow.

553
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,249
I wish you could have known him
better.

554
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,597
I took him on as a duty,

555
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:00,439
but I liked him more and more
the longer I knew him.

556
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,179
Perhaps you saw his qualities
for yourself.

557
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,999
Which obviously you did.

558
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,279
I had an uncle who went like that.

559
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,559
Finished his cocoa, closed his book
and fell back dead on the pillow.

560
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,879
I don't think Mr. Pamuk bothered
with cocoa much, or books.

561
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,539
He had other interests.

562
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:31,299
I meant you can go just like that,
with no reason.

563
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,079
That's why you should treat every
day as if it were your last

564
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,039
Well, we couldn't criticise Mr. Pamuk
where that's concerned.

565
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,599
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

566
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,559
Careful with that.

567
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,439
- Gwen, are you busy?
- Your Ladyship?

568
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,079
I saw this.
It came out yesterday. Look.

569
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,999
It's for a secretary at a new firm
in Thirsk.

570
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,423
- See?
- What, I don't understand.

571
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:05,819
How did you know? That you wanted
to leave? Carson told my father.

572
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,199
- And you don't mind?
- Why should I?

573
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,279
I think it's terrific that
people make their own lives,

574
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,119
especially women.

575
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,679
Write to them today and name me as
your reference.

576
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,919
I can give it
without ever specifying

577
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,279
precisely what your work here
has been.

578
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,539
Milady?

579
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,359
Thank you.

580
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,599
Lady Grantham.

581
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,679
I've come to say goodbye.

582
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,479
They're bringing the car round,
to take me to the station.

583
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,519
Have you said goodbye to Mary?

584
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,479
I have.

585
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,959
Will we be seeing you here again?

586
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,599
Nothing would give me more pleasure,
but I'm a little busy at the moment.

587
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,799
I wonder if I might risk
embarrassing you?

588
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,239
I should like to make myself clear.

589
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,359
The truth is, Lady Grantham,
I am not a vain man.

590
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,719
I do not consider myself
a very interesting person.

591
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,879
But I feel it's important that
my future wife should think me so.

592
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,519
A woman who finds me boring could
never love me,

593
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,119
and I believe marriage should be
based on love.

594
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,359
At least, at the start.

595
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,039
Thank you for your faith in me,
Mr. Napier.

596
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,999
Your instincts do you credit.

597
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,319
Good luck to you.

598
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,359
- Did Mr. Napier get off all right?
- He did, milord.

599
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,719
And poor Mr. Pamuk has been taken
care of?

600
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,159
We got Grassbys from Thirsk
in the end.

601
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,079
They're very good and they didn't
mind coming out on a Sunday.

602
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,199
Is everyone all right downstairs?

603
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,279
Well, you know...

604
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,079
He was a handsome stranger from
foreign parts one minute,

605
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,039
the next,
he was as dead as a doornail.

606
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,679
It's bound to be a shock.

607
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,859
Of course, upstairs or down.

608
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,719
It's been horrid for the ladies,
and for the female staff, I expect.

609
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,719
It's particularly hard
on the younger maids.

610
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,679
Indeed.

611
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,719
Don't let the footmen be too coarse
in front of them.

612
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,559
Thomas likes to show off,

613
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,199
but we must have a care
for feminine sensibilities -

614
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,799
they are finer and more fragile
than our own.[]

615
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,039
Mr. Bates?

616
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,619
I am going to have to insist that
you tell me what is the matter.

617
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,339
I thought it was for Mr. Carson
to give me orders.

618
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,419
Mr. Carson's no better than any other
man when it comes to illness.

619
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,699
Now tell me what it is
and I'll see what I can do.

620
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,699
It's nothing, truly.

621
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,539
I've twisted my bad leg and walked
on it too soon.

622
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,619
It'll be fine in a day or two.

623
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,259
Well, if it isn't,
I'm sending for the doctor.

624
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,819
The Dowager Countess.

625
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,859
Oh, my dears.

626
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,899
Is it really true?

627
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,939
I can't believe it.

628
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,499
Last night, he looked so well.

629
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,379
Of course, it would happen to
a foreigner. It's typical.

630
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,099
Don't be ridiculous.

631
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,859
I'm not being ridiculous.

632
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,739
No Englishman would dream of dying
in someone else's house.

633
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,699
Especially someone they didn't even
know.

634
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,859
Oh, Granny, even the English aren't
in control of everything.

635
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,059
I hope we're in control of something,
if only ourselves.

636
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,139
But we're not. Don't you see that?

637
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,339
We're not in control of
anything at all.

638
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,019
Edith, go and tell Mary
to come back at once

639
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,059
and apologise to her grandmother.

640
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,859
No, leave her alone.

641
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,979
She's had a shock. We all have.

642
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,019
Just let her rest.

643
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,859
Just the ticket.

644
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,859
Nanny always said sweet tea was
the thing for frayed nerves.

645
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,779
Though why it has to be sweet,
I couldn't tell you.

646
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,060
What did you mean,

647
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:13,819
Mr. Pamuk lived each day
as if it were his last?

648
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,459
What I said.

649
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,499
Well, how did you know?

650
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,899
Can't keep William waiting. Gangway.

651
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,019
I'll be asking
the same question later,

652
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,939
so you'd better have an answer ready.

653
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:30,579
Daisy, where have you hidden the
flour? I can't see it anywhere.

654
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,619
It's just there, Mrs. Patmore.

655
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,099
Well, fetch it to me, then.
You're all in a daze today.

656
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,579
Do you think we should have gone up
there?

657
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,699
To see how they are?

658
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,499
I sent a note, but I thought I'd be
in the way. Why?

659
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,459
I thought Mary was rather struck
with him last night, didn't you?

660
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,939
Well, it must have been frightful
for all of them,

661
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,859
but there it is.

662
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,019
In the midst of life, we are in
death.

663
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,859
I suppose Mr. Napier will have to
manage everything.

664
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,979
I suppose he will.

665
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,219
We all thought him a very nice
gentleman.

666
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,299
Yes, he is nice.

667
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,779
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

668
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,979
I don't expect so, no.

669
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:22,379
Because we rather hoped Lady Mary
might have taken a shine to him.

670
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,699
Seems not.

671
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,779
Oh, well.

672
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,939
There are plenty more fish in
the sea than ever came out of it.

673
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,779
Are you looking for something?
Lady Mary?

674
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,779
I just wanted to make sure the room
had been tidied up,

675
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,979
after the...
after the people had left.

676
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,219
Life can be terribly unfair,
can't it?

677
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,099
It certainly can.

678
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,499
Everything seems so golden,
one minute,

679
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,899
then turns to ashes, the next.

680
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,579
Can I ask you a question, Carson?

681
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,260
Have you ever felt
your life was somehow...

682
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,459
slipping away...

683
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,019
... and there was nothing you could do
to stop it?

684
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,219
I think everyone feels that,
at one time or another.

685
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,419
The odd thing is, I feel...

686
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,179
... for the first time, really,

687
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,879
I understand what it is
to be happy.

688
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,859
It's just I know that I won't be.

689
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,819
Don't say that, milady.

690
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,059
Don't raise the white flag
quite yet.

691
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,739
You can still be mistress of
Downton.

692
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,539
Old Lady Grantham hasn't given up
the fight, not by a long chalk.

693
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,579
Oh, that?

694
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,539
I wasn't even thinking about that.

695
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,739
And, if I may say so, milady,
you're still very young.

696
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,439
Am I?

697
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,539
I don't feel it.

698
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,739
We're all behind you, milady.

699
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,539
The staff, we're all on your side.

700
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,579
Thank you, Carson.

701
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,059
You've always been so kind to me.

702
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,560
Always.

703
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,139
From when I was quite a little girl.

704
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,179
Why is that?

705
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,499
Even a butler has his favourites,
milady.

706
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,219
Does he?

707
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,019
I'm glad.

708
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,979
Lady Mary?

709
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,339
Oh, milady. I thought...

710
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,099
Carson and I were just making sure

711
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,499
that everything was shipshape and
Bristol fashion,

712
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,499
and it is.

713
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,419
Good night, Carson.

714
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,379
Good night, milady.

715
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,859
Of all the men on earth,
I mean, he looked so fit.

716
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,099
Dr. Clarkson said it was
a heart attack.

717
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,019
- Did you see any signs?
- I didn't have much chance to study the gentleman.

718
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,099
You don't suppose there's anything
sinister in it, do you?

719
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,099
Every day, the papers warn us of
German spies,

720
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,299
and they did say his presence was
essential for peace in Albania...

721
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,379
I doubt it, milord.

722
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,139
Anyone wanting to poison his food
would have to get past Mrs. Patmore.

723
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,899
Blimey, that's a thought.

724
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,859
Unless, of course,
she's a spy herself.

725
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,259
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong,
Bates.

726
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,819
You'll be in no trouble.
I only want to help.

727
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:45,459
I know that, Your Lordship,
and I am grateful,

728
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,499
but there is nothing
I need help with.

729
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,339
- Good morning, Mrs. Hughes.
- Good morning, milord.

730
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,299
I wonder if you...

731
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,619
Now, will you kindly explain
what in heaven's name is going on?

732
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,779
I'm perfectly well, Mrs. Hughes.
A bit stiff, that's all.

733
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,339
Just so long as you know,
I'm not leaving until you tell me.

734
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,859
I hope you have a strong stomach.

735
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,979
Oh, my God.

736
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:02,979
Cousin Mary?

737
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,619
Hello.

738
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,819
- Are we expecting you?
- No, but I wanted to see you.

739
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:12,219
I looked for you yesterday,
at church.

740
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,639
I wasn't feeling up to it.

741
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,259
None of us were.

742
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,419
It must have been a horrible shock.

743
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,039
Yes.

744
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:26,099
- And he seemed a nice fellow.
- He was.

745
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,379
A very nice fellow.

746
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,619
So, if there's anything I can do...

747
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,779
... please ask.

748
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,339
There isn't, but thank you.

749
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,499
Well, here goes.

750
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:58,779
Do you not think
we ought to say a few words?

751
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:02,019
What? 'Good riddance'?

752
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,659
That and your promise.

753
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,579
Very well.

754
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:11,619
I promise I will never again
try to cure myself.

755
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,319
I will spend my life happily
as the butt of others' jokes,

756
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,899
and I will never mind them.

757
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,219
We all carry scars, Mr. Bates,
inside or out.

758
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:23,419
You're no different to
the rest of us, remember that.

759
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,459
I will try to.

760
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,419
That I do promise.

761
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,739
Good riddance!

762
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,612
So he definitely went in?

763
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:41,439
I saw him walk through the door.

764
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,699
But you don't know
if he went back to his own room?

765
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,819
Yes, I do, cos I was the one
who found him there the next day.

766
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,099
What I mean is you don't know if
he went back under his own steam.

767
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,859
I suppose not, but how else
would he have done it?

768
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,059
That's what they call
the big question.

769
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:01,099
I don't wanna get in any trouble
over this.

770
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,419
Don't worry, you won't.

771
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,459
Your secret's safe wi' me.

772
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,919
You could stay if you
married Matthew.

773
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,599
I'm a lost soul to you.

774
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,879
What chance did he have,
against a champion?

775
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,142
You're hiding behind him,
but he's not what you think he is.

776
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,519
Don't quarrel with Matthew.

777
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,719
- Why shouldn't I?
´- One day, you may need him.

778
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,720

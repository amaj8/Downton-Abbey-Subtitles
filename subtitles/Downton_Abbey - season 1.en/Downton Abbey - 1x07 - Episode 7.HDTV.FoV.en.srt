1
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
Hurry up, girls. Come on.

2
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,050
Come on, come on! You
should be done here!

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,920
They'll be back from the
station any second now!

4
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,520
I haven't had a chance
to ask. How was London?

5
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,940
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy. Quite enjoyable.

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,580
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

7
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,470
I'm perfectly capable of getting
the house ready.

8
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,750
Of course you are. But I'd like
to have the heavy luggage back and

9
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,470
unpacked before they get here.

10
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,420
I suppose... Steady, William!

11
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,390
This isn't a race.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,020
- Poor lad.
- But he did see her?

13
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,590
I was worried when I
took him to King's Cross.

14
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,500
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,940
How is he now?

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,510
Well, you've only got
one mother, haven't you?

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,190
They're here, Mrs. Hughes!

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,210
Hello, William. It's
good to have you back.

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,210
What a relief to be home.

20
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,520
Don't listen when His Lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season!

21
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,150
When in Rome...

22
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,590
Will Lady Mary be back soon?

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,210
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple of weeks.

24
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,290
So Grantham House is closed?

25
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,280
It will be by the end of this week.

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,050
Dear Mrs. Hughes,

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,980
I hope you've had some time to
yourself while we've been away.

28
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,810
I've tackled a few jobs that get
forgotten when the house is full.

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,320
- Any local news?
- The main topic here

30
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,530
is the murder of the Austrian
Archduke.

31
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,160
Here and everywhere else.

32
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,120
I'm afraid we haven't
heard the last of that.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,280
- How's William?
- Bearing up.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,360
Poor chap. He has our sympathies.

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,850
I think I'll wash the
train off before dinner.

36
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,000
Very good, my lord. I can
unpack while you're bathing.

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,250
I'll see you up there.

38
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,270
Mrs. Hughes, have you thought about
the garden party for the hospital?

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,360
I've started on it, but there
are things we need to talk about.

40
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,450
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.

41
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,450
I'll take my hat off.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Sybil?

43
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,750
You were a great success in
London, darling. Well done.

44
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,570
- You never say that to me.
- Don't I?

45
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,950
You were very helpful, dear.
Thank you.

46
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,500
I hate to spoil
Her Ladyship's homecoming,

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,420
but what are we going
to do about Mrs. Patmore?

48
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,180
She's worse than when
you left. Much worse.

49
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,170
And I meant to ask,

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,240
is there a decision
about Mr. Bates leaving?

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,110
Not yet. His Lordship
wants the facts

52
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,150
and Mr. Bates won't give them.

53
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,110
So what are you going to say to
Her Ladyship about Mrs. Patmore?

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,550
I'm not sure. I don't want
the poor woman sacked, but...

55
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,330
things cannot go on as they are.

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,160
There's nothing like an English
summer, is there?

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,380
Except an English winter.

58
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,580
I'm sorry you haven't
received more invitations.

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,280
But then, after
four seasons, one is

60
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,820
less a debutante than a survivor.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,840
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

62
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,530
- No.
- Only, one hears stories.

63
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,590
There's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,490
So, have you decided...

65
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,180
whether or not to
marry Cousin Matthew?

66
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,900
There's no secret Cora can
keep for more than a month.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,050
You'd be surprised.

68
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,750
I've told him I'll give him
my answer the day I get back.

69
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,710
Well, it would be very tidy.
At least we can say that.

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
- Fancy a smoke?
- Don't mind if I do.

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,470
There they go... Guy
Fawkes and his assistant.

72
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,660
- Which is which?
- Here you are.

73
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,890
Surely, if His Lordship
hasn't done anything until now,

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,330
it means he doesn't want
to take it any further.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,350
Anna's made me an armband,
Mr. Carson.

76
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,050
For my mother. Can I wear it?

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,910
I daresay. Not when
we're entertaining,

78
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,260
but otherwise...

79
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Hello, Doctor. I didn't
know you were here.

80
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,200
No. Lady Grantham sent a message.

81
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,570
- Why? She's not ill, is she?
- Not... ill, exatly.

82
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,090
Would you mind waiting
in the library?

83
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,150
Pregnant?

84
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,970
You needn't be quite so shocked.

85
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,030
Give me a moment.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,380
You haven't been
pregnant for 18 years!

87
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,690
And I'm pregnant now!

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,670
I don't understand what
we've done differently.

89
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,180
Stop right there! If you want to know
more, go and offer the doctor some whisky.

90
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,660
I can't take it in.

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,910
But...you're pleased?

92
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,340
Of course...

93
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,240
Of course I'm pleased.

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,860
I didn't think she'd do it.

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,920
I told you she would.

96
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,360
I could see she was interested.

97
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,200
I was speaking as one lady's maid
to another. That means something!

98
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,030
Course, we thought we had him
before but he's a slippery devil.

99
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,380
It's unusual, obviously.

100
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,640
Unusual? It's Biblical!

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,160
Not quite.

102
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,460
You understand that women go
through a...certain change.

103
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,060
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,810
Well, sometimes it can result in
a surge of...

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,010
fertility, for want
of a better word.

106
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,210
- But the child will be healthy?
- There's no reason why not.

107
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,450
How long has she...?

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,080
Hard to be precise. Things
had become irregular, but...

109
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,530
- Please...
- I'd say she's about four months gone.

110
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,210
It'll begin to show soon.

111
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,490
And I don't suppose there's any
way of knowing... if it's a...

112
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,770
I do beg your pardon, my lord.
I thought you were alone.

113
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,730
Please come in, Mrs. Hughes.

114
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,130
- I'm just leaving.
- William?

115
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,590
Well, thank you, Doctor.

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,660
- I'd better write some letters.
- Show Dr. Clarkson out.

117
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,860
I didn't want to bother Her
Ladyship if she's not well...

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,990
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

119
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
It's Mrs. Patmore, my lord.

120
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,610
The time has come when we
really have to make a decision.

121
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,370
- Now do you believe me?
- Careful, Thomas.

122
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,250
Your position is not a strong one.

123
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,040
Don't punish us, Mr. Carson.
It's Mr. Bates who's wanting here.

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,010
Tell me, Mr. Carson, do you think it right

125
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,730
a man like that should
live and work at Downton?

126
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,320
Mr. Napier, my lady.

127
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,340
What a surprise!

128
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,980
I'm afraid you've
just missed my aunt.

129
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,160
I know.

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,740
I watched her leave.

131
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,690
How are your wedding plans going?

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,890
Not very well.

133
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,540
In fact, we've
decided to call it off.

134
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
Really?

135
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,050
It seemed quite
fixed at Sybil's ball.

136
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,180
What a shame... Please.

137
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,850
- It'll be better in the long run.
- Perhaps.

138
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,410
I know what high hopes you
have of the institution.

139
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,030
The thing is, Lady Mary, I...

140
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,920
I'm here today because I needed
to tell you something face to face,

141
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,790
before you went to the country.

142
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,360
Face to face? Gracious me.

143
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,170
I've recently heard
gossip about the time

144
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,070
when I came to Downton
with Kemal Pamuk,

145
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,310
gossip that I believe has
made life difficult for you.

146
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,580
I've also heard it said that
I am the source of these stories.

147
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,890
It is very important to me that
you should know that I am not.

148
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,280
From that day to this, I have
never spoken one word on the matter.

149
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,750
Then who did?

150
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,210
It seems to have come from the
Turkish Embassy,

151
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,320
from the Ambassador himself,
in fact, and his wife.

152
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,680
But who told them, if not you?

153
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,340
This is the hard part.

154
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,410
When I discovered the answer, I
debated whether I should relay it,

155
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,570
but in the end, I
feel you ought to know.

156
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,260
The suspense is killing me.

157
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,100
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

158
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,650
That is why people
accept the story.

159
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Edith?

160
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,050
It's very hard to believe.

161
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,330
Harder for you than for me.

162
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,270
I love the thought of a baby in
the house, but if it's a boy...

163
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,650
It'll be very hard on Mr. Crawley.

164
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,790
I know. I was no great
champion when he first arrived.

165
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,330
But it seems to me he's tried his
best and he's done the decent thing.

166
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,010
I can't see that coming off.

167
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,730
You don't mean the engagement?

168
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,370
But it's not an engagement yet,
is it?

169
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,680
She'd never throw him over!

170
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,530
Mr. Carson, Lady Mary Crawley does
not deserve you.

171
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,990
<i>And she is not been in
touch with cousin Matthew?</i>

172
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,930
<i>Not that I heared.</i>

173
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,830
Wonderful news, of course.

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
You must look after yourself.

175
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,740
Don't worry. O'Brien has me
wrapped in silk and feathers.

176
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,390
You're lucky.

177
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,690
I have a horrible feeling

178
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,020
Simmons is about to
hand in her notice.

179
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,460
She's looking very fidgety lately,

180
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,460
and I saw her hurrying
to meet the postman.

181
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,930
Oh, you poor thing.

182
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,910
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

183
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,780
Why would she want to leave me?

184
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,680
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

185
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,960
Most of the time.

186
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,020
I want to say I'll
make provision for you

187
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,140
if it's a boy and
you get pushed out.

188
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,490
Don't worry. I know you can't.

189
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,240
If any man living understands the
strength of the entail, it's me.

190
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,480
I can give you Crawley House
for life, if it's a help.

191
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,850
- Have you heard from Mary?
- No. Have you?

192
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,670
By the way, I want to ask a favour.
What's the name of your cook,

193
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,970
the one you brought
with you from Manchester?

194
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
Mrs. Bird?

195
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,830
- I'll get it, Mrs. Patmore!
- Don't fuss me!

196
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,930
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,100
How are you feeling?

198
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,350
Well, most people's
parents die before them,

199
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,340
- and so they should.
- Oh, give it a rest.

200
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,940
Your mother knew how to drag
it out. I'll say that for her.

201
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,890
- What?
- Thomas!

202
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,900
Get up to the servery.

203
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,030
- You gave me the wrong cloth!
- Sit down, Mrs. Patmore.

204
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,370
I can't when I've got
the luncheon to finish!

205
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,090
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

206
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,260
Daisy and I will finish
the luncheon.

207
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,030
So he'll give us this house
for life, will he? How generous!

208
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,980
It is generous. He doesn't have to.

209
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,220
But it's made me think.

210
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:27,010
You must stay here if you want.

211
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,470
But I wonder if it
mightn't be better all round

212
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,550
if I went back to Manchester.

213
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,490
It may not be a boy.

214
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,830
Oh, really, Mother! You never
approved of it all in first place!

215
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,510
If it is a boy,
you should see it as a release,

216
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,170
not a disappointment.

217
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,260
What does Mary say?

218
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,490
Nothing yet.

219
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,980
You wanted to see Mrs. Bird, sir.

220
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,730
Yes. Mrs. Bird, Lord Grantham
has rather a favour to ask of you.

221
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,250
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

222
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,390
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Quite all right.

223
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,990
Mr. Bates, it's about your
somewhat startling confession.

224
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,100
As you'll have surmised, His
Lordship has yet to make a decision.

225
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,980
His delay is generous.

226
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,530
However, it will be
no surprise to you

227
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,260
that Miss O'Brien has been
unwilling to let things drop.

228
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,700
It seems that when we were in
London, she made a new friend...

229
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,850
a lady's maid in the house of a

230
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,150
colonel in your former regiment.

231
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,730
Please tell me that this account
is false, at least in part.

232
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,000
I wish I could.

233
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,850
I'll have to show this
to His Lordship.

234
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,970
Of course you will. I do not like
to play the part of Pontius Pilate,

235
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,250
Eu não gosto de fazer o
papel de Pontius Pilate,

236
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,280
but I'm afraid I must.

237
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,770
Lord Grantham will decide
what's to be done.

238
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Mr. Bates,

239
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,200
I hope you do not feel
that I treated you unjustly.

240
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,310
On the contrary, Mr. Carson,

241
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,840
I am astonished at your kindness.

242
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,660
<i>Of all of you,</i>

243
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,840
Sybil might find joy in a cottage,

244
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,350
but not you.

245
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,530
- We don't know it'll be a boy.
- Exatly.

246
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,870
So ask Matthew to wait
until the child is born.

247
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,850
If it's a girl, you
can wed him happily

248
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,160
and all will be as it was before.

249
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,520
But if I delay, won't he think I'm
only after him for his position?

250
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,430
Besides, I'm not sure
I want to put him off,

251
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,330
even without the title.

252
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,320
We get on so well, you know.

253
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:12,020
And he's terribly clever.

254
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,160
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

255
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,100
And he might not.

256
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,160
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

257
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,610
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

258
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,920
as the wife of a country solicitor?

259
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,930
But why would we ever want a
telephone at Downton, my lord?

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,520
Well, they have their uses.

261
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,000
You could speak to the housekeeper
in London.

262
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,240
That'd be helpful, surely?

263
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,770
I hope I have not failed in my
management of the recent move?

264
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,120
Not at all. But the
telephone is here now,

265
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,450
and the girls got used to
it when we were in London.

266
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,160
Besides, none of us know what
the next few months will bring.

267
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,070
Because of the Archduke's death?

268
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,410
Austria won't get what
it wants from Serbia.

269
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,740
And now Russia's
starting to rumble.

270
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,750
Well, there's not much
we can do about that.

271
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,680
So, will you take care
of the telephone man?

272
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,640
Oh, about Mr. Bates, my lord.

273
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,930
I expect you've had time to
consider the contents of that letter?

274
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,740
Yes. But I find it very odd.

275
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,640
Regimental silver?

276
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,710
I could more easily
see Bates as an assassin

277
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,610
- than a petty pilferer.
- I agree.

278
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,290
And while the letter
is hard to argue with,

279
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,940
I wouldn't put anything
past Thomas or Miss O'Brien.

280
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,190
- So, what did we miss?
- Nothing much.

281
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,520
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

282
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,680
- Have you thought about Matthew?
- Of course.

283
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,750
- But Aunt Rosamund says...
- No!

284
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,350
She's written to
me. Pay no attention.

285
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,220
But Granny, she has got a point.

286
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,820
Mary can't be completely naive.

287
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,940
- I don't need your help, thank you.
- Mary, listen to me.

288
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,170
If you take Matthew now,
when his whole future is at risk,

289
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,790
he will love you to
the end of his days.

290
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,110
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

291
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,640
I've been called many things,
but never that.

292
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,450
And what happens if
the baby is a boy?

293
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,670
- And Matthew loses everything?
- Mary can always change her mind.

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,890
I can't do that to Matthew.

295
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,480
It's not how we are together.

296
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,420
I'm going upstairs
to help Anna unpack.

297
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,860
I'll come with you.

298
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,460
Edith, why don't you go too?

299
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,020
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

300
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,380
He asked after you.

301
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,450
Is she really serious about him?

302
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,890
Any port in a storm...

303
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,930
By the way, I must
right about my maid.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,440
She's leaving, to get married.

305
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,830
- How could she be so selfish?
- I do sympathise.

306
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,410
Robert's always wanted me to get
rid of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

307
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,880
Anyway, she's so fond of me.

308
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,220
Well, I thought
Simmons was fond of ME!

309
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,930
What am I to do?

310
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,230
I'll put an
advertisement in The Lady.

311
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,390
It's always the
best place to start.

312
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,890
That's so kind. Thank you.

313
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,630
I really must be going.

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,620
Now, don't let Mary wait for
the baby

315
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,990
before she gives
Matthew her answer.

316
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,180
I'm sure it's another girl.

317
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,040
I know those men of
the moral high ground.

318
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,530
If she won't say yes
when he might be poor,

319
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,780
he won't want her
when he will be rich.

320
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,850
Maybe we should knit something.

321
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,370
Oh, yes, I'm sure
they'd love a pair

322
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,860
of bootees knitted by you.

323
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,290
- Or what about a Christening mug?
- They can buy their own silver.

324
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,490
- Anything in the paper?
- They've arrested Princip and his gang.

325
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,820
All Serbian and members
of the Black Hand.

326
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,640
The Black Hand? I don't like
the sound of that.

327
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,050
I don't like the
sound of any of it.

328
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,690
- War is on the way.
- Then we'll have to face it...

329
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,960
- as bravely as we can.
- Thank you, Mr. Cannon Fodder.

330
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,630
Don't YOU think a war's coming?

331
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,710
Oh, there'll be a war,
and it's time to prepare for it.

332
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,890
- The country, do you mean?
- No. Me.

333
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,910
You never disappoint.

334
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Daisy, run and find Mrs. Patmore.

335
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,540
His Lordship wants to see her
in the library.

336
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,620
His Lordship wants Mrs.
Patmore to go up to the library?

337
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,660
That is what I said.

338
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,770
And Anna, you're to come too.

339
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,660
And we thought the assassination
of an archduke was a surprise.

340
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,610
Mrs. Patmore, my lord.

341
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,760
Your Lordship, I know things
haven't been quite right for a while,

342
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,180
- but I can assure you...
- Come in, Mrs. Patmore.

343
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,240
I promise you, my lord,

344
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,160
if I could just be
allowed a bit more time...

345
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,240
Mrs. Patmore, I have not asked
you here to give you your notice.

346
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,520
- Haven't you?
- No.

347
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,100
I understand you've had
some trouble with your sight.

348
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,250
That's just it!

349
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,610
- I know I could manage better if...
- Please, Mrs. Patmore!

350
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,990
Let him speak!

351
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,160
- Beg pardon, my lord.
- Don't apologise.

352
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,260
Now, on Dr. Clarkson's
recommendation,

353
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,710
I'm sending you up to London to see
an eye specialist at Moorfields.

354
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,790
Anna will go with you and you'll
stay with my sister Rosamund

355
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,740
in her new house
in Belgrave Square.

356
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,710
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
sit in your presence, my lord.

357
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
Of course.

358
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
But how will you get on here?

359
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Well,

360
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,940
Mrs. Crawley is lending
us her cook... Mrs. Bird.

361
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,300
She's coming over tomorrow.

362
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,720
You will be good enough to
show her how things work.

363
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,570
Are the Crawleys to
starve while I'm away?

364
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,750
They'll eat here every evening.

365
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,150
Now, my sister's butler
will look after you.

366
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,290
He's very nice.

367
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,440
Anna, you won't mind
a visit to London?

368
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,210
No, my lord. Thank you.
It'll be an adventure.

369
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,860
One with a happy ending, I hope.

370
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,120
Let me get this clear.
At Sybil's ball you said

371
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,440
you'd give me your answer
the day you got back,

372
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,090
- and now you say you will not!
- Why do we have to rush into it?

373
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,360
- I need to be sure, that's all.
- But you WERE sure.

374
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,600
Should I tell I think altered you.
My prospects!

375
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:31,950
- Because nothing else has changed!
- No!

376
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes!

377
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,260
If your mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

378
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,700
and I go back to living on my wits!

379
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,020
And you rather not follow me.

380
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,610
Oh, Mathew! You always make
everything so black and white!

381
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,840
I think this IS black and white!

382
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,950
Do you love me enough to
spend your life with me?

383
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,910
If not, then say no.

384
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,030
- If you do, then say yes.
- I want to...

385
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,770
Granny told me I
should say yes now,

386
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,010
then withdraw if
you lost everything.

387
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
To make that work, you'd
have to be a good liar.

388
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,700
Are you a good liar?

389
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:08,720
Not good enough to try, apparently.

390
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,780
How could you not have realised
they'd discover the loss at once?

391
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,380
And to keep them in your house...

392
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
- But you only served two years?
- That's right, my lord.

393
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,560
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating fator.

394
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,750
I just want to know the truth.

395
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,570
I cannot speak of it, my lord.

396
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,200
You must decide whether I stay or go

397
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,250
on the basis of the
evidence before you.

398
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
I will respect that.

399
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,740
I'm sorry.

400
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,510
I don't believe it.

401
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,270
How can you say that?

402
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,120
When I've confessed to the crime?

403
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
Well, His Lordship obviously doesn't
think that's all there is to it,

404
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,960
and I don't either.

405
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,640
Anna, are you set for the
nine o'clock train tomorrow?

406
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,870
All packed and ready.

407
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,770
You'll be met at King's Cross
by Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

408
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:11,000
which I think is generous, but
after that, you're on your own.

409
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,460
Right. I must get on. I'm acting
referee for Mrs. Patmore and Mrs. Bird.

410
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,470
Best of luck.

411
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,290
Will you miss me?

412
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,940
Try not to miss me.

413
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,190
It'll be good practice.

414
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,540
I expect it'll be hard
adjusting to this kitchen,

415
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,470
after the one you're
used to. Not to worry.

416
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,820
I'm sure I can have it
cleaned up in no time.

417
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,830
- Cleaned up?
- I'm not criticising.

418
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,280
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

419
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,320
- You'll have met Daisy and the others?
- I have.

420
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,950
Though what they all find
to do is a mystery to me.

421
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,930
Are you not used to
managing staff, Mrs. Bird?

422
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,600
I'm used to getting it done with

423
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,880
one kitchen maid, Mrs. Patmore,

424
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,280
but I suppose, in
a house like this,

425
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,750
you expect to take it easy.

426
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,970
Do you think we should erect a ring

427
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,580
and let them fight it out?

428
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,970
She's all right, Mrs. Bird.

429
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,560
She's more of a
general than a trooper,

430
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,520
but you need that in a cook.

431
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,440
Mrs. Patmore's the Generalissimo.

432
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,640
Well, I'm very sad.

433
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,680
I thought Mary was
made of better stuff.

434
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,650
Don't speak against her.

435
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
Of course, she's taken advice from

436
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,370
someone with false
and greedy values.

437
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,870
- Mother!
- And we don't have to go too far

438
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,060
- to know who that is!
- Mother!

439
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,170
- I've a good mind...
- You do not go near Cousin Violet.

440
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,190
That is an order.

441
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,260
- Something's not right about it.
- I agree.

442
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

443
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,420
even if he COULD walk.

444
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,620
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

445
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,340
and he normally comes down on
this sort of thing very hard.

446
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,390
- What's his reasoning?
- He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

447
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,510
He says they've been working against
Bates since he got here.

448
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,810
So I should sack O'Brien instead?

449
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,550
You'll hear no argument from me.

450
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,610
This should do the trick, my lady.

451
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,740
Ten years of my life.
That's what I've given her.

452
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,520
- Ten bloody years!
- But did she say she'd sack you?

453
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,830
- It's obviously what he wants.
- So when will they tell you?

454
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,790
When they've found a replacement.

455
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,660
Heaven forefend she should have
to put a comb through her own hair!

456
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,650
- And if I'm going, you won't be far behind.
- Oh, so what? Sod 'em.

457
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,230
There's a war coming
and war means change.

458
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,370
- We should be making plans.
- What are you talking about?

459
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,220
Well, put it like this. I don't
want to be a footman any more,

460
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,970
but I don't intend to be
killed in battle neither.

461
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,480
I'm not saying poison them!

462
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,660
Just make sure they don't find
her food all that agreeable.

463
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,990
- By poisoning it?
- Will you stop that?

464
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,030
You don't want it to taste nice.

465
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,200
I want them to be glad
when I get back, that's all.

466
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,630
At this will be for the family and

467
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,520
the one in my pantry for the
staff or more precisely... me.

468
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,430
We don't know if
we can provide two.

469
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,700
Then perhaps we should
find another supplier.

470
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,550
Oh, all ge...

471
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,230
Right, where the seat
of the other telephone.

472
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,370
Yeah. In the out of hall.

473
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,000
- Good afternoon, Carson. Is Lady Edith in?
- I am!

474
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,220
I most certainly am!

475
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,350
- I was just driving past.
- Yes?

476
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,230
I thought you might
like to come for a spin.

477
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,590
If you're not too busy.

478
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,070
Wait till I get my coat.

479
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,040
Is it all right if
I make some notes?

480
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,490
- I'm so sorry, Mr...?
- This is Mr. Bromidge, my lady.

481
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,480
He's here about the telephone.

482
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,180
Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr. Bromidge.

483
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,400
We're so looking forward to it.
What an exciting business to be in!

484
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,480
- You must be expanding every day.
- Oh, we are, sir.

485
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,750
But that brings its problems.

486
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,160
Training up men for the work,
when many have no aptitude.

487
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,920
I can't even find a secretary

488
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,220
who can keep pace at the moment.

489
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,790
- What?
- It's hard with a new concept.

490
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,140
Too old, and they can't change.

491
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,050
Too young, and
they've no experience.

492
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,040
Have you filled the post yet?
Because I know just the woman.

493
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,090
Well, she must hurry up. We'll
close the list tomorrow night.

494
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,520
You'll have her
application. I promise.

495
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,300
- This isn't bad at all, is it?
- I don't know.

496
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,190
No-one told me
there'd be an actual operation.

497
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,840
What did you think?

498
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,750
They were just going to make
magic passes over your eyes?

499
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,350
All right, Mrs...Patmore?

500
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,850
She'll be fine. Thank you.

501
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,010
And you've been sent to
us by the Earl of Grantham?

502
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,080
That's right.

503
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,710
Very good.

504
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,380
You can leave now.

505
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,670
We'll keep her in for a week.

506
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,820
You can collect her next Friday.

507
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,760
- I'll be in to visit every day.
- What about the rest of the time?

508
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,460
Don't worry!

509
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,160
You'll be fine.

510
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,490
- Bates, you say?
- John Bates.

511
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,670
He must have left the
army about eight years ago.

512
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,710
Wait here, please.

513
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,370
- Have you finished the soup?
- I think so, Mrs. Bird.

514
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,930
- And the sauce for the fish?
- Yes, Mrs. Bird.

515
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,680
You can put them in the warmer.

516
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,750
You don't mean John Bates,
who went to prison for theft?

517
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,220
That's correct.

518
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,050
Well, I know who
he is right enough.

519
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,170
That was an odd business.

520
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,990
Why odd?

521
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,240
Never mind.

522
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,360
So you're his cousin and
you'd like to be in touch?

523
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,790
Very forgiving.

524
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,490
I've got no address
for him or his wife.

525
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,280
But I have got one for his mother,
which should still be good.

526
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,660
I've written it down for you.

527
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,100
Thank you for your trouble.

528
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,330
Is it true you wrote to the
Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?

529
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,440
- Who told you?
- Someone who knows that you did.

530
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,990
Then why are you asking?

531
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,670
Because I wanted to give you one
last chance to deny it.

532
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
And what if I did?

533
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,280
He had a right to know
how his countryman died.

534
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,740
In the arms of a slut.

535
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,940
How's that advertisement
getting on for new maid?

536
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:52,240
Well, it's only just come out.

537
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,940
William and I can manage here now.

538
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,380
Tell Mrs. Bird we'll have
our dinner in 20 minutes.

539
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,120
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs. Bird
the dinner was really delicious.

540
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,120
- So, how was the drive?
- It was lovely.

541
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Only...

542
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Yes?

543
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
Well,

544
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,980
he said he had a question for me.

545
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,850
He told me he'd ask
it at the garden party

546
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,720
and he hoped I'd say yes.

547
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,720
You must think very carefully
what your answer will be.

548
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,580
Yes, I should think very
carefully about a lot of things.

549
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,550
- Do your neighbours have one?
- Yes, they do in London, anyway.

550
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,430
It seems wise to
get a telephone now.

551
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,160
If there is a war, it may be hard
to have one installed in a house.

552
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,700
Let me show you where
we're going to put it.

553
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,410
First electricity now telephones.

554
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,090
Sometimes I feel as if I were
living in an HG Wells novel.

555
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,910
But the young are all so calm
about change, aren't they?

556
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,750
Look at Matthew.

557
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,150
I do admire him.

558
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,060
Do you?

559
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,220
- What have I done wrong now?
- Oh, please.

560
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,140
Don't pretend Mary's
sudden reluctance

561
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,760
can't be traced back to you.

562
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,229
Well, I shall pretend it.
I told her to take him.

563
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,780
Your quarrel is with my daughter
Rosamund, not me.

564
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,800
So put that in your
pipe and smoke it!

565
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,330
Mr. Molesley.

566
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,170
- What are you after?
- I want a word with Mr. Carson.

567
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,570
I'm here to have my dinner.

568
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,530
- You don't want much, do you?
- What are you doing?

569
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,480
Mr. Carson dropped his
wallet in the passage.

570
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,690
I was replacing it.

571
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,340
But everything seemed so settled
between you at Sybil's ball.

572
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,210
Things have changed since then.

573
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,340
Not necessarily.

574
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,440
I don't seem to be much
good at making boys.

575
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,970
Any more than I'm
much good at building

576
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,210
my life on shifting sands.

577
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,950
You do know I should be very
proud to have you as my son-in-law,

578
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,570
whatever your prospects?

579
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,010
Unfortunately, sir,

580
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,090
your daughter is more
practical than you.

581
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,870
- Will you join us, Mrs. Bird?
- I don't mind if I do.

582
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,720
I'm not sure Mrs. Patmore
would like that, Mr. Carson.

583
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,240
Cook always eats separate,
that's what she says.

584
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,960
Not in our house.
There's only four of us.

585
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,990
Well, you're going any minute. She's
advertised for your replacement.

586
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,610
That filthy, ungrateful cow.

587
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,920
Let the kitchen maids
have theirs on their own.

588
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,310
You stay with us.

589
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,530
Her Ladyship said to tell you
that the dinner was delicious.

590
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,700
- She can't have!
- Daisy? Does that surprise you?

591
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,690
What have you done with
this, you little beggar?

592
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,970
I knew it! That's why I
said it was for upstairs.

593
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,670
Come on! Tell us what's in it!

594
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,320
Just... water and a bit of soap.

595
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,070
And you've put something
in the fish sauce as well?

596
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,650
Only... mustard and aniseed.

597
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,740
Why, Daisy? Why would
you do such a thing?

598
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,830
Mrs. Patmore was worried they'd
prefer Mrs. Bird's cooking

599
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,590
and they wouldn't
want her to come back.

600
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,230
Is that likely?

601
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,980
When they've taken such
trouble to get her well?

602
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,640
I'm sorry!

603
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,040
There, there.

604
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,800
There are worse crimes on earth
than loyalty.

605
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,210
Dry your eyes,

606
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,920
and fetch the beef stew
I was making for tomorrow.

607
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,510
You've not had a chance
to spoil that, I suppose?

608
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,110
I was going to mix in
some syrup of figs,

609
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,560
but I've not done it yet.

610
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,030
At least we'd all
have been regular.

611
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,290
Carson said you were here.

612
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,240
Just checking that everything's
being done right, my lady.

613
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,790
Only, we never heard back.

614
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,360
That is, Miss Dawson
never heard back from you,

615
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,890
about an interview.

616
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,520
Yes, we got the
young lady's letter.

617
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,570
But the trouble is,

618
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,390
she didn't have any
experience of hard work.

619
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,660
But she's a very hard worker!

620
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,280
I couldn't find any proof of it.

621
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,310
And she gave you as a reference,

622
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,910
when you don't run
a business, my Lady.

623
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,160
Well, not that I'm aware of.

624
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,170
Lily? Can you find Gwen and

625
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,530
tell her to come to the hall now?

626
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Yes, my lady.

627
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:18,120
The reason Gwen didn't
give any more details

628
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,370
is because she works
here, as a housemaid.

629
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,570
And you thought that'd put me off?

630
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,890
But she's taken a postal course

631
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,080
and has good speeds in typing
and Pitman shorthand. Test her!

632
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,470
I will, if I like the look of her.

633
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,220
So, young lady.

634
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,970
You thought I'd turn up
my nose at a housemaid?

635
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,880
- Well, I did, sir.
- Well,

636
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,310
my mother was a housemaid.

637
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,480
I've got nothing
against housemaids.

638
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,150
They know about hard work and
long hour, that's for sure.

639
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,090
I believe so, sir.

640
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,940
Right, well, is there somewhere
we could talk?

641
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,210
Gwen, take Mr. Bromidge to the
library.

642
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,980
I'll see no-one disturbs you.

643
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,820
Sorry, Papa, you can't go in there.

644
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
Why on earth not?

645
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,880
Gwen's in there with Mr. Bromidge.
She's being interviewed.

646
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,200
I cannot use my library

647
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:20,740
because one of the housemaids is
in there applying for another job?

648
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,360
That's about the size of it.

649
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,860
So, what is it you want to know?

650
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,910
I want to know the truth about
the case against him.

651
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,950
I want to know why the officer
thought it was "odd".

652
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,320
I want to know what Mr. Bates isn't
saying.

653
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,770
Because you don't
believe him to be guilty?

654
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,050
No, I don't.

655
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,020
I know he's not.

656
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:56,930
Well...

657
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,430
You're right, of course.

658
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,880
Then who was it?

659
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,560
Who was the thief?

660
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,990
His wife. Vera.

661
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,550
Who do you call? No-one
you know has got one!

662
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,410
But they will have. You'll see.

663
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,760
Might I enquire why my pantry
has become a common room?

664
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,390
Sorry, Mr. Carson.

665
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,770
But...do you know how it works?

666
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,910
- Of course I do.
- Could you show us?

667
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,090
Certainly not.

668
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,970
A telephone is not a toy,

669
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,960
but a useful and valuable tool.

670
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,510
Now, get back to your work.

671
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,910
She worked at the
barracks sometimes,

672
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,930
helping at big dinners and so on.

673
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,870
That night her opportunity
came and she took it.

674
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,870
They knew it was her.

675
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,490
Someone even saw her
with a big carryall.

676
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,470
But why did he confess?

677
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,710
Well...

678
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,210
John wasn't the same man in those
days.

679
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,340
The African war had shaken
him up and made him angry.

680
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,640
He'd been wounded

681
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,560
and he drunk a lot more
than was good for him.

682
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:40,090
- Was he violent?
- No. No, not violent.

683
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,820
He could hard at times,
with a tongue like a razor.

684
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,490
He felt he'd ruined Vera's life,
Miss Smith.

685
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,080
- Do you agree with him?
- No.

686
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,460
I thought she was a
nasty piece of work.

687
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,720
That's why he took the blame.

688
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,170
Surely, if everyone knew

689
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,380
- he was innocent...
- But he confessed!

690
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,610
There was nothing
anybody could do once

691
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,370
he'd confessed.

692
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,610
Could I ask you something, sir?

693
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,950
Only, I get the feeling
that a war's on the way.

694
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,800
I'm afraid we all do.

695
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,690
And when it comes, I want to be
really useful to my country.

696
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,660
- How heartening.
- So I've been thinking,

697
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,630
what could be more
useful than what you do?

698
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,730
Bringing people back
to health, back to life.

699
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,980
I see.

700
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,520
Well, erm, we are
looking for volunteers

701
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:37,640
to train for the
Territorial Force hospitals,

702
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,320
- if that's what you mean.
- It's exatly what I mean.

703
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,060
- Will you not be missed here?
- Maybe. But we'll all be going, won't we?

704
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,680
The younger men, anyway.

705
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,990
As you wish. I'll make enquiries.

706
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,170
Thank you very much, Doctor.

707
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:57,790
Mr. Molesley walked in and there
he was, as bold as brass,

708
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,410
taking my wallet
out of my change coat.

709
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,440
Mr. Molesley would have no
reason to make it up, my lord.

710
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,940
He doesn't know Thomas.
Why would he lie?

711
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,740
So Thomas has been
caught red-handed.

712
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,580
Well, we knew he was a thief.

713
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,450
And now we have unimpeachable proof.

714
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,050
I'm afraid he has to go.

715
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,740
I hate this sort of thing,

716
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,300
with Lady Grantham's
condition and everyrhing.

717
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,940
Can we at least wait
until after the garden party?

718
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,080
Very well, my lord. But
then I think we must act.

719
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,200
How long will you wear them?

720
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,330
A week or so.

721
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,230
But I can see much better
already, even with them on.

722
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:39,430
Thanks heaven.

723
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,320
Now, we need to talk
about the garden party.

724
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,900
Mrs. Bird and I
have made some lists.

725
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:45,950
Mrs. Bird?

726
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,550
I think we can manage without
any help from Mrs. Bird.

727
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Can you?

728
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,670
Well, if you want your garden party to be
run by Blind Pugh, that's your business.

729
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,280
Mrs. Patmore, there's a lot to be done
and you're only just up on your feet.

730
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,620
We really cannot manage
without Mrs. Bird.

731
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,880
If you say so.

732
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,320
Now, I've been checking the stores

733
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,120
and I've ordered what
you'll need for the baking.

734
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,290
That's very kind, Mrs. Hughes, but

735
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,830
I believe WE should
check the stores,

736
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,390
when it's convenient.

737
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,290
Mrs. Bird, at Downton Abbey,

738
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,720
the housekeeper manages
the store cupboard, but...

739
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,830
I've never not run my own
store cupboard in my life.

740
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,410
Separate the cook from
the store cupboard?

741
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,430
Where's the sense in that?

742
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,910
How long have I been
saying this, oh, Lord?

743
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,670
We're the ones who cook it.

744
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,820
We should be the ones to order it.

745
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,640
Mrs. Bird, I shall be very glad
of your help with the garden party.

746
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,290
I'm sure we can manage it easily...

747
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,410
between the two of us.

748
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
Hello?

749
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,050
This is Downton Abbey.

750
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,470
Carson the butler speaking.

751
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,140
Hello.

752
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:18,580
This is Mr. Carson, the
butler, of Downton Abbey.

753
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,930
To whom am I speaking?

754
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,350
But I'm not shouting!

755
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,550
Who are YOU?

756
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,300
Mrs. Gaunt.

757
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,280
No, I don't want to place a call.

758
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,260
I was practising my answer.

759
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,830
Well, I daresay a lot of the things
you do sound stupid to other people!

760
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:46,690
I've written to your mother.
She's very anxious, naturally.

761
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,510
- She suggested coming over.
- Oh, God.

762
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,100
Well, that's what I thought.

763
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:54,360
So I put her off. Told her
to come and admire the baby.

764
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,730
- I'll just run Your Ladyship's bath.
- Thank you, O'Brien.

765
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,710
- Have you had any answers about the position?
- Quite a few.

766
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,290
<i>So what did they sound like?</i>

767
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,650
<i>One I think has real possibilities.</i>

768
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,180
<i>She learned to do hair in Paris</i>

769
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,380
<i>while working for the Ambassadress.</i>

770
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,150
<i>Sounds promising.</i>

771
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,150
- Carson, I've been meaning...
- Your Lordship?

772
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:29,760
- Anna, you're back safely, then?
- Yes, thank you, my lord.

773
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,610
And Mrs. Patmore's
fighting fit again.

774
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,450
"Fighting fit" is the phrase!

775
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,650
Is something the matter?

776
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,710
I wanted to see Your
Lordship because...

777
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,180
Please.

778
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,320
While I was in London, I learned

779
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,510
something about Mr. Bates.

780
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,620
- Not bad, I hope.
- No. Not bad at all.

781
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,210
I'd have told Mr. Carson, but

782
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,650
I thought you might like
to hear it from me first.

783
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,900
Go on.

784
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,000
I went to call on
Mr. Bates's mother.

785
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:09,940
O'Brien,

786
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,130
how long do you think it takes
a lady's maid to settle in?

787
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,810
Depends on the maid, my lady.

788
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,490
Of course it does.

789
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,860
Sorry.

790
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,510
The other half's under the bath.

791
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,560
Never mind. Thank you.

792
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,590
I'll just go and sort
out your clothes, my lady.

793
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,600
Thank you.

794
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,360
Sarah O'Brien, this
is not who you are.

795
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,160
My lady, if you could just wait...

796
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,120
The doctor's gone, Your Lordship,
but he's coming back after dinner.

797
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:26,870
Lady Mary's with her now.

798
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,420
Thank you.

799
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,070
I don't suppose
you'll want to change.

800
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,550
But is there anything
else I can do to be useful?

801
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,920
It was a boy.

802
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,970
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to embarrass you.

803
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,210
I'm not embarrassed.

804
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,050
I just wish
you could have been spared this.

805
00:48:52,051 --> 00:48:53,440
I know you do.

806
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680
Thank you.

807
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,180
By the way, Anna's told me what
she learned in London.

808
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,780
Has she?

809
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:04,790
She's not told me.

810
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,310
Well, the good news is
you won't be leaving Downton.

811
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,210
And I need some good news today.

812
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,730
That poor wee babe.

813
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,670
How's Her Ladyship doing?

814
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:35,430
I'll take her up
a tray in a minute,

815
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,810
but I dare say she won't touch
a bite.

816
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,040
What about you, Miss O'Brien?

817
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,120
What about me?

818
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,360
It must have been quite a shock.

819
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,460
Yes. Yes it was.

820
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,520
I think you'd better dine with us,
Mr. Branson.

821
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,980
We can't know
if you might be needed later.

822
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:54,950
Well, I'm to go for the doctor at ten.

823
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,950
What a long-faced lot!

824
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,130
Kindly show some respect.

825
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,240
Come on, Mr. Carson!
She'll get over it.

826
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,470
They're no
bigger than a hamster at that stage.

827
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,930
Will you shut up?

828
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,770
I agree. What is the matter
with you, Thomas?

829
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,620
I don't know. I suppose all
this makes me feel claustrophobic.

830
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,940
I'm sorry, of course I am,

831
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,280
but why must we live through them?

832
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,480
They're just our employers.
They're not our flesh and blood.

833
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,130
Thomas, don't be so unkind.

834
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,120
Is there nothing left on earth
that you respect?

835
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
OK.

836
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:33,430
Blimey, if he carries on
like this for the unborn baby

837
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,610
of a woman who scarcely knows
his name,

838
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:38,760
no wonder he fell to pieces
when his old mum snuffed it.

839
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,220
William!

840
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:48,170
Thomas! William! Parem!

841
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,360
Does it enough!

842
00:50:57,369 --> 00:50:58,369
Come Here!

843
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,171
Calm down!

844
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,260
Thomas!

845
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,560
I've done as I promised.

846
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,440
General Burton is commanding
a division at Richmond.

847
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,900
I think I may have a place there
for you.

848
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,620
And Colonel Cartwright.
These are the papers.

849
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,770
When you're ready,

850
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,130
pop to the local recruiting office

851
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,480
and they'll take it from there.

852
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,090
As a matter of fact, I'm

853
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:11,560
being drafted back
in as a Captain. So...

854
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,910
- I'll try to keep an eye on you
- That's very kind of you, Doctor.

855
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,740
With any luck,
there may be some advantage

856
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:19,130
in your having volunteered so early.

857
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,060
Hang on a minute.

858
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,190
Now give me yours and take
this one at the same time.

859
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,080
William, I'm sorry I've been
unkind to you lately.

860
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:28,090
That's all right.

861
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,950
Not, it is not. I don't know
why I said those things.

862
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,010
You were under an evil spell.

863
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,140
I'm not under it now.

864
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,470
- I'm glad.
- Friends?

865
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,180
Always friends.

866
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,710
I think we should start
the ices now.

867
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,610
If you agree, Mrs. Patmore.

868
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,070
Certainly, Mrs. Bird.

869
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,680
My Lord! Listen to that!

870
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,630
It's like the cry of the banshee.

871
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,330
Mr. Carson's telephone's ringing.

872
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,990
Isn't someone going to answer it?

873
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:59,940
I wouldn't touch that thing
with a ten-foot pole.

874
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,990
Well, I will, then.

875
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,400
No, Mr. Carson's busy,

876
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,340
but can I take a message?

877
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,790
I wish I supose.

878
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:18,660
I've got news, milady.

879
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:22,870
I'm sorry.

880
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,140
Mr. Bromidge has rung!

881
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,710
You've done it, Gwen!
You've got the job!

882
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,690
You could take it? Take it!

883
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,700
Something to calebrate?

884
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,910
I've got the job, Mrs. Hughes!
I'm a secretary! I've begun!

885
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,280
I'm very happy for yoy, Gwen,

886
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,950
and we'll celebrate after
we've finished today's work.

887
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,670
Of course, Mrs. Hughes.

888
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,090
- I don't supose...
- Lady Sybil.

889
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,860
Her Ladyship was asking after you.

890
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,200
Be carreful, my lad.

891
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,570
Or you'll end up with no job
and a broken heart.

892
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,510
What do you mean?

893
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:18,090
I don't seem to be able to find
your sister.

894
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,630
I wonder where she is.

895
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:21,980
Of course
she may have been cornered.

896
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:24,920
I know there was some old bore
she was trying to dodge.

897
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:26,660
Who is that?

898
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,870
I'm not sure.

899
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,510
He's simply ghastly, apparently.

900
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,820
But he's promised to propose today.

901
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,550
I can't tell you how funny she was
when she acted it out.

902
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,800
She ought to go on the stage.

903
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:36,870
Really?

904
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,110
How amusing.

905
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,280
Well done. Mrs. Hughes.

906
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,650
Beautifully executed as always.

907
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,490
The key is in the planning.

908
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,770
Mr. Carson, probably
this isn't the moment,

909
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:53,340
but I've heard from Dr. Clarkson I've
been accepted for a training scheme

910
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,970
for the Army Medical Corps.

911
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,250
- Have you indeed?
- Yes, I know want to do it.

912
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,670
So I'll be handing in my notice.

913
00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:00,780
I'll serve out the month, of course.

914
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:01,960
Thank you, Thomas.

915
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,690
We can talk abou it later.

916
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:10,340
And you couldn't have planned
that any better either.

917
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,550
You can't be leaving yet!

918
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,960
I'm afraid I must.

919
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,440
Please, make my excuses
to your mother.

920
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:22,810
But I...

921
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,840
I wish you'd come inside, milady.

922
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
No.

923
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,420
People mustn't think I'm really ill.

924
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,530
I don't want to cast a dampener
on the party.

925
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Very well.

926
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:16,710
But are you sure you have
everything you need, milady?

927
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,250
Dear O'Brien.

928
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,480
How sweet you are.

929
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,990
O'Brien! O' Brien.

930
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,890
Can I have a word?

931
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:41,240
I need a favour and I don't want
to bother Lady Grantham with it.

932
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:42,170
Certainly, my Lady.

933
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:44,640
She's been
helping me find a new maid

934
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,740
and we've had quite a few answers
from her advertisement.

935
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,520
Can you find where she's put them, and get
Branson to bring them to the Dower House?

936
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,040
Her Ladyship was helping you find
a new lady's maid?

937
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,050
Yes.

938
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,610
We should have asked you, really.

939
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,740
You might take a look at the letters
if you have a minute.

940
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:04,320
There was one we liked the sound
of who'd been trained in Paris.

941
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:08,440
Do you know
where she might have put them?

942
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,660
The answers?

943
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,410
Yes, milady. There are only two
or three places they could be.

944
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,680
Thank you, O'Brien. You
are a treasure. Thank you.

945
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,050
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

946
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,990
Pretty, though, isn't it?

947
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,110
Hard to believe the clouds
are gathering on a summer's day like this.

948
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,780
Mr. Bates,

949
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,760
I know you think I was
wrong to call on your mother...

950
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,980
I don't think that.

951
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,000
She likes you, by the way.

952
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,950
I had to find out the truth.

953
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,610
But, you see, you don't
know the whole truth.

954
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,260
Even now. You know
my mother's truth.

955
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:53,600
But not your wife's...

956
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:57,730
Where is she now?

957
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:59,510
I couldn't tell you.

958
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,200
I'd better get back.

959
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:11,510
Are you here, Mr. Molesley?
I didn't know that.

960
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:13,220
Just helping out.

961
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:16,180
Nice girl, that Anna.

962
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,060
Do you know if she's got anyone
special in her life?

963
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,220
I'd like to say she hasn't.

964
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:24,900
I would, truly.
But I'm afraid there is someone.

965
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,780
And do you think he's keen on her?
Or is it worth a go?

966
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:30,640
Well, he keeps himself to himself

967
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,260
and he's very hard
to read at times. But...

968
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,580
I'd say he's keen.

969
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,250
I'd say he was very keen, indeed.

970
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:41,910
Daisy!

971
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,060
I said ices not iced cakes.

972
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:49,010
Now, unclog your ears and get Mr.
William before they turn into soup.

973
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:54,090
But I don't understand.
Nothing's changed.

974
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,420
Everything's changed.

975
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,220
You can't be sure I
was going to refuse you,

976
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,710
even if it had been a boy,

977
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,580
because I'm not.

978
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:00,690
That's the point.

979
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:02,310
I can't be sure.

980
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,980
Of you or of anything, it seems.

981
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,810
The last few weeks
have taught me that.

982
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,410
But you can't leave Downton.

983
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:10,120
I can't stay.

984
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,150
Not now.

985
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,130
Well, what will you tell Papa?

986
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,660
That I'm grateful
for what he's trying to do.

987
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,690
But the experiment is at en end.

988
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:20,870
I'm not a puppet

989
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,050
and I must take charge
of my own life again.

990
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,840
Would you have stayed...

991
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,850
if I'd accepted you?

992
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,570
Of course.

993
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:35,130
So I've ruined everything.

994
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,910
You've shown me I've been living
in a dream.

995
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,090
And it's time to to return
to real life.

996
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,650
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

997
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,490
God knows I wish the best for you.

998
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:03,770
Well, Rosamund?

999
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,830
I'm afraid your
meddling has cost Mary

1000
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,470
the only decent offer
she'll ever get.

1001
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,090
I'm sorry mama, but you know me.

1002
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,570
I have to say what I think.

1003
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,680
Why?

1004
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,410
Nobody else does.

1005
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,070
Are you quite well, milady?

1006
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,830
Of course.

1007
01:00:31,650 --> 01:00:33,130
You know me, Carson.

1008
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,770
I'm never down for long.

1009
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,840
I know you have spirit, milady.

1010
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,670
And that's what counts.

1011
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,120
It's all that counts, in the end.

1012
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,070
There.

1013
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:01,480
So Mary is to be denied her
Countess's coronet after all.

1014
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:02,870
Don't crow at me.

1015
01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:05,680
I think she was very foolish
not to take him when she could.

1016
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,300
I told her so.

1017
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:09,650
If I'm perfectly honest,
I wonder if Mathew

1018
01:01:09,669 --> 01:01:11,910
isn't making the same
mistake right now.

1019
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,100
Are you warm enough?

1020
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,970
I am when you're holding my hand.

1021
01:01:23,470 --> 01:01:26,070
Your Lordship,
this has just arrived for you.

1022
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,080
Thank you.

1023
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,970
I'm happy to tell you

1024
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:31,570
that Thomas
has just handed in his notice.

1025
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:34,760
So we'll be spared any unpleasantness
on that score.

1026
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,070
What a relief.

1027
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,770
Please! Will you stop, please?

1028
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,930
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

1029
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,680
can I ask for silence?

1030
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,560
Because I very much regret
to announce...

1031
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:07,140
... that we are at
war with Germany.

1032

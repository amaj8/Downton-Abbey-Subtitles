1
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,090
Here we are, ma'am. Crawley House.

2
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,790
For good or ill.

3
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,160
I still don't see why I
couldn't just refuse it.

4
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,950
There's no mechanism
for you to do so.

5
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,440
You WILL be an earl, you
WILL inherit the estate.

6
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,990
Of course, you can throw it away
when you have it, that's up to you.

7
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,450
Can I help?

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm Molesley, sir.
Your butler and valet.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,350
- Mr. Molesley, I'm afraid...
- May I introduce ourselves?

10
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,590
I am Mrs. Crawley, and this is
my son, Mr. Matthew Crawley.

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,720
I'll just give Mr. Taylor
a hand with the cases.

12
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,480
- I can...
- Thank you, Molesley.

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,890
I won't let them change me.

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,620
Why would they want to?

15
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,000
Mother, Lord Grantham has
made the unwelcome discovery

16
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,080
that his heir
is a middle-class lawyer

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,990
- and the son of a middle class doctor.
- Upper middle class.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,690
He wants to limit the damage by
turning me into one of his own kind.

19
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,700
When you met him in
London you liked him.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,240
I simply do not understand
why we are rushing into this.

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,610
Matthew Crawley is my heir.

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,800
Patrick was your heir.
He never lived here.

23
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,080
Patrick was in and out of this
house since the day he was born.

24
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,480
You saw how many of the village
turned out for the service.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,360
- Nothing's settled yet. It
- Is settled, my dearest one,

26
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,850
whether you like it or not.

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,480
I wouldn't say that.

28
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,690
Not while your mother breathes air.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
Oh, Ellen,

30
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,850
this is much better than
I thought it would be.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,420
- You have done well.
- Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,740
Would you like this in here,
ma'am, or taken up to your room?

33
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,210
In here, thank you.

34
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,900
So, are you the whole
of our new household?

35
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,780
There's a local girl, ma'am, Beth.

36
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,350
She's to double under-housemaid
and kitchen maid.

37
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,650
- This is ridiculous.
- Thank you very much, Molesley.

38
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,660
- Might we have some tea?
- Very good, ma'am.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,250
- Well, he can go right now.
- Why?

40
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,450
Because we do not need a butler,
or a valet if it comes to that.

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,720
We've always managed perfectly
well with a cook and a maid,

42
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,350
- and they cannot expect us to...
- What they expect, Matthew,

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,140
is that we won't know how to
behave, so if you don't mind

44
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,110
I would rather not
confirm their expectations.

45
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,050
I have to be myself, Mother.

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,760
I'll be no use to anyone
if I can't be myself.

47
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,870
And before they, or you,
get any ideas,

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,930
- I will choose my own wife.
- What on earth do you mean?

49
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,160
They'll push one of
the daughters at me.

50
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,220
They'll have fixed on that when
they heard I was a bachelor.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,350
Lady Mary Crawley.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,860
I do hope I'm not interrupting.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,790
- Lady Mary.
- Cousin Mary, please.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
Mama has sent me down to welcome you
and to ask you dine with us tonight.

55
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,910
Unless you're too tired.

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,520
- We would be delighted.
- Good.

57
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,960
Come at eight.

58
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
Won't you stay and have some tea?

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,880
Oh, no. You're far too busy.

60
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,210
And I wouldn't want to push in.

61
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,090
Lynch, I think we'll go
back by the South Lodge.

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Very good, m'lady.

63
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,820
Lady Mary, I hope you
didn't misunderstand me.

64
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,380
I was only joking.

65
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,800
Of course. And I agree.

66
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,160
The whole thing is a complete joke.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
So what do you think
we'll make of them?

68
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,540
I shouldn't think much.

69
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,400
She hasn't even got a lady's maid.

70
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,700
It's not a capital offence.

71
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,710
She's got a maid. Her name's Ellen.

72
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,140
She's not a lady's maid.

73
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,240
She's just a housemaid

74
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,490
that fastens hooks and
buttons when she has to.

75
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,810
There's more to it
than that, you know.

76
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,850
Daisy!

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,330
We want some very precise
reporting when dinner's over.

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,040
- Are we to treat him as the heir?
- Are we 'eck as like!

79
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,530
A doctor's son from Manchester?!

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,890
He'll be lucky if he gets
a civil word out of me.

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,250
We're ALL lucky if we get
a civil word out of you.

82
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,590
Gwen, parcel for you.
Came by evening post.

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,920
Thank you, Mr. Carson.

84
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
William.

85
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,490
Have you seen them yet, Mr. Carson?

86
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,920
By "them", I assume you mean the
new family. In which case, no.

87
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,820
I have that pleasure to
look forward to this evening.

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,700
Daisy, did you hear me call or
have you gone selectively deaf?

89
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,760
- No, Mrs. Patmore.
Then might I remind you

90
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,160
we are preparing dinner
for your future employer?

91
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:10,690
And if it goes wrong,
I'll be telling them why!

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,430
Why are they here at all
when you're going to undo it?

93
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,260
Your father's not
convinced it can be undone.

94
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,920
But you'll still try.

95
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,940
Granny and I are willing to try.

96
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,610
And Papa is not?

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,550
We'll bring him round, you'll see.

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,480
We're trying to find a
lawyer who'll take it on.

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,850
So what are they like?

100
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,200
She's nice enough,

101
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,250
but he's...very full of himself.

102
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,430
- Why do you say that?
- Just an impression.

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,260
Let's go down and you
can decide for yourself.

104
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,990
Hello again.

105
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,120
It's a pleasure to meet
you at last, Mrs. Crawley.

106
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,850
We're delighted to be here.

107
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,680
- Aren't we, Matthew?
- Delighted.

108
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,660
Welcome to Downton.

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,180
Thank you. You've been so kind.

110
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,480
What a reception committee!

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,680
Yes. Thank you.

112
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,820
This is Carson. We'd
all be lost without him.

113
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,280
Mama, may I present Matthew Crawley
and Mrs. Crawley?

114
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,070
My mother, Lady Grantham.

115
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,660
What should we call each other?

116
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,990
Well, we could always start with
Mrs. Crawley and Lady Grantham.

117
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,420
Come into the drawing room and
we can make all the introductions.

118
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,820
<i>Thank you, Carson.</i>

119
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,290
Do you think you'll
enjoy village life?

120
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,620
It'll be very quiet
after life in the city.

121
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,630
Even Manchester.

122
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm sure I'll find
something to keep me busy.

123
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,170
- You might like the hospital.
- What sort of hospital is it?

124
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,400
How many beds?

125
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,750
Well, it isn't really a hospital.

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,640
Don't let Dr. Clarkson hear you.

127
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,080
He thinks it's second
only to St Thomas's.

128
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,480
It's a cottage hospital, of
course, but quite well equipped.

129
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,630
Who pays for it?

130
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,070
Oh, good. Let's talk about money!

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,550
My father gave the building
and an endowment to run it.

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,640
In a way, he set
up his own memorial.

133
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,760
But how splendid.

134
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,090
And Mr. Lloyd George's new
insurance measures will help.

135
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,880
Please don't speak that man's name.
We are about to eat.

136
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,410
I will hold it steady and
you can help yourself, sir.

137
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,960
Yes, I know.

138
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
Thank you.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,530
You'll soon get used to the
way things are done here.

140
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,580
If you mean that I am accustomed
to a very different life from this,

141
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,910
then that is true.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,820
What will you do with your time?

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,580
I've got a job in Ripon.

144
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,940
I said I'll start tomorrow.

145
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,910
A job?!

146
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,710
In a partnership. You might have
heard of it. Harvell and Carter.

147
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,860
They need someone who understands
industrial law, I'm glad to say.

148
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,850
Although I'm afraid most of it
will be wills and conveyancing.

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,450
You do know I mean to involve
you in the running of the estate?

150
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,310
Well, don't worry. There are
plenty of hours in the day.

151
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,360
And of course I'll
have the weekend.

152
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,450
We'll discuss this later.
We mustn't bore the ladies.

153
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
What is a weekend?

154
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,410
- Why shouldn't he be a lawyer?
- Gentlemen don't work, silly.

155
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,470
Not real gentlemen.

156
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,510
- Don't listen to her, Daisy.
- No, listen to me!

157
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
And take those kidneys
up to the servery before I

158
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,240
knock you down and serve
your brains as fritters!

159
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,540
Yes, Mrs. Patmore!

160
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,970
I wonder what that Mr.
Molesley makes of them.

161
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,210
Poor old Molesley. I pity
the man who's taken that job.

162
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,000
Then why did you apply for it?

163
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,610
I thought it might help me
to get away from you, Mr. Bates.

164
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,830
I'm so interested
to see the hospital.

165
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,870
Well, you would be, with
your late husband a doctor.

166
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
Not just my husband.

167
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,350
My father and brother too, and I
trained as a nurse during the war.

168
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,380
Fancy.

169
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,310
I'd love to be
involved in some way.

170
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,950
Well, you could always help with
the bring-and-buy sale next month.

171
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,320
That would be most appreciated.

172
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,450
I should say so.

173
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,750
She's a match for the old lady.

174
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,230
She wasn't going to give in.

175
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,010
What old lady are you
referring to, Thomas?

176
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,490
You cannot mean her ladyship
the Dowager Countess.

177
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,330
Not if you wish to
remain in this house.

178
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,850
No, Mr. Carson.

179
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
William.

180
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,230
Are you aware the seam at
your shoulder is coming apart?

181
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,780
I-I felt it go a bit earlier
on. I'll mend it when we turn in.

182
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,570
You will mend it now! And you
will never again appear in public

183
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,230
- in a similar state of undress!
- No, Mr. Carson.

184
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,930
To progress in your
chosen career, William,

185
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,590
you must remember that a
good servant at all times

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,020
retains a sense of pride and dignity

187
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,510
that reflects the pride and
dignity of the family he serves.

188
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,750
And never make me
remind you of it again.

189
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,960
I'll do it.

190
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,310
And cheer up. We've all
had a smack from Mr. Carson.

191
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,260
You'll be the butler
yourself one day.

192
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,990
- Then you'll do the smacking.
- I could never be like him.

193
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,920
I bet he comes from
a line of butlers

194
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,090
that goes back to the Conqueror.

195
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,330
He learned his business,
and so will you.

196
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,110
Even Mr. Carson wasn't
born standing to attention.

197
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,250
I hope not, for his mother's sake.

198
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
This was at the back door.

199
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,740
Thank you, William.

200
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,970
It's kind of you
to take an interest.

201
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,010
I'm afraid it's a case of
the warhorse and the drum.

202
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,000
You know my late
husband was a doctor.

203
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,940
I do. I'm familiar
with Dr. Crawley's work

204
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,630
on the symptoms of
infection in children.

205
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,080
Even I studied nursing
during the South African war.

206
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,090
Really?

207
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,490
Very distressing.

208
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,060
Young farmer. John Drake.
Tenant of Lord Grantham's.

209
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,130
He came in today.

210
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,370
It's dropsy, I'm afraid.

211
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,950
- May I see him?
- Yes, by all means.

212
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,290
Is the dropsy of the
liver or the heart?

213
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,040
Everything points to the heart.

214
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,400
Alright, Mr. Drake.
You're in safe hands now.

215
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,120
What will happen to his wife?

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,840
She may try to keep the farm on.

217
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,590
Grantham is not a
harsh landlord, but...

218
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,430
her children are young.

219
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,270
What can I do to help?

220
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,720
If I'm to live in this village,
I must have an occupation.

221
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,770
Please. Let me be useful.

222
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,260
He chooses his clothes himself.

223
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,980
He puts them out at night

224
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,370
and hangs the ones he's worn.

225
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,440
I get to take the linen down to
the laundry, but that's about all.

226
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,630
That's all?

227
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,460
"I'll do this," he says. "I'll
take the other." "I'll tie that."

228
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,650
And I'm just stood
there like a chump,

229
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,020
watching a man get dressed.

230
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,450
To be honest, Mr. Bates,

231
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,240
I don't see the point of it.

232
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,410
- I thought you didn't like him.
- So what?

233
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,840
I have plenty of
friends I don't like.

234
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,930
Would you want Mary
to marry one of them?

235
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,180
Why do you always have to pretend
to be nicer than the rest of us?

236
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,480
Perhaps I am.

237
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,910
Then pity your wife,

238
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,610
whose fortune must go
to this odd young man

239
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,690
who talks about weekends and jobs.

240
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,880
If Mary were to marry him,
then all would be resolved.

241
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,960
- What have you got there?
- Nothing.

242
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,140
What kind of nothing?

243
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,450
You haven't got an admirer.

244
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,030
I might have. Why shouldn't I?

245
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,560
Don't tell Mrs. Hughes.

246
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,680
She'll bring the vicar
round to have you exorcised.

247
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,380
How are we supposed
to find husbands

248
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,270
if we're never allowed to see
any men?

249
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,020
Perhaps she thinks
the stork brings them.

250
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,250
'Ey, Lady Mary's in for a surprise.

251
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,690
Thomas was in the library when
old Violet came in from the garden.

252
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,650
Seems they want to fix
her up with Mr. Crawley.

253
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,100
Well, it makes sense. She
was gonna marry Mr. Patrick.

254
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,050
Would she have, though,
when it came to it?

255
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,790
That's the question.

256
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,280
Ah, there you are, dear.

257
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,340
I was hoping you'd be home in time.

258
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,710
In time for what?

259
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,400
I've been paid the
compliment of a visit.

260
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,150
- Hello!
- Good afternoon, Cousin Matthew.

261
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Good afternoon.

262
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,490
We were just saying how
charming this room is now.

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,110
Mm. It always seemed rather dark
when my mother-in-law lived here.

264
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,420
But then she made
everything rather dark!

265
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,750
Sir.
No, thank you.

266
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,210
- Cup of tea, sir?
- It's alright, I'll help myself.

267
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,070
So, Molesley,

268
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,160
how do you find being home again?

269
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,340
Your father must
be glad you're back.

270
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,100
He is, your ladyship.

271
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,260
- Might I give you this cup?
- Ma'am.

272
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,250
I'm afraid we must be going.

273
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
Thank you.

274
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,180
You'll think about it?

275
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,770
Oh. I thought no one was here.

276
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,490
Can I help, Mr. Carson?

277
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,400
No. No thank you, Anna.

278
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,880
May I?

279
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,990
I must compliment
you, Mrs. Crawley.

280
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,480
When you made your offer I thought
you might be a Great Lady Nurse

281
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,150
and faint at the sight of blood,

282
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,440
but I see you're
made of sterner stuff.

283
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,370
It's definitely the heart.

284
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,740
It's almost too
quiet to hear at all.

285
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,950
I'm afraid so.

286
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,450
I've been thinking about
the treatments that are available.

287
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,700
Considerable success has been
achieved over the last few years

288
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,550
by draining the pericardial
sac of the excess fluid

289
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,410
and administering adrenalin.

290
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,830
Mrs. Crawley, I appreciate
your thoroughness...

291
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,220
But you're unwilling to try it?

292
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,300
Injection of adrenalin is a
comparatively new procedure.

293
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,030
It's a while ago now, but
I saw my husband do it.

294
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
- I know how.
- Please, Mrs. Crawley,

295
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,540
don't force me to be uncivil.

296
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,790
We will be setting
an impossible precedent.

297
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,210
When every villager could...

298
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,840
could demand the
latest fad in treatment

299
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,690
for each new cut and graze.

300
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,360
I would remind you that we're
not talking of a cut or a graze,

301
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,470
but the loss of a man's life
and the ruin of his family.

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Of course.

303
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,140
But I beg you to see
that it is not reasonable.

304
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,010
I'm sorry, but I have standards.

305
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,060
I've just seen
something ever so odd.

306
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,720
If anyone thinks I'm going to
pull my forelock and curtsey

307
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,140
to this Mr. Nobody from nowhere...

308
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,150
O'Brien!

309
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,220
Were you discussing Mr. Crawley?

310
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
Yes, m'lady.

311
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,390
Is it your place to do so?

312
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,700
I've got my opinions,
m'lady, same as anybody.

313
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,580
Can I help your ladyship?

314
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,440
This is the button we're
missing from my new evening coat.

315
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,880
I found it lying on the gravel.

316
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,150
But... I was shocked

317
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,360
at the talk I heard as I came in.

318
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,430
Mr. Crawley is his
lordship's cousin and heir.

319
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,750
You will, therefore, please accord
him the respect he is entitled to.

320
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,430
But you don't like
him yourself, m'lady.

321
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,440
You never wanted him...

322
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,590
You're sailing perilously
close to the wind, O'Brien.

323
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,900
If we're to be friends, you
will not speak in that way again

324
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,780
about the Crawleys or any
member of Lord Grantham's family.

325
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,270
Now I'm going up to rest.
Wake me at the dressing gong.

326
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,260
I don't think that's fair.
Not here in the servants' hall.

327
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,720
I agree. If she was a real lady,
she wouldn't have come down here.

328
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,020
She'd have rung for me
and given me the button.

329
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,200
This isn't her territory. We
can say what we like down here.

330
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,120
- Who says?
- The law.

331
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,480
And parliament.

332
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,830
There is such a
thing as free speech.

333
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,780
Not when I'm in charge!

334
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,580
Don't push your luck, Thomas.

335
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
Now, tea's over. Back to work.

336
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,440
You'd better take this.

337
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Friends!

338
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,420
Who does she think she's fooling?
We're not friends.

339
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,020
- No?
- No!

340
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,280
And you're not friends
with the girls neither.

341
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,340
We're servants, you and me.

342
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,850
And they pay us to do as
we're told. That's all.

343
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,510
- May I...?
- I can manage.

344
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,620
Where have I put my cuff links?

345
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,520
- I thought these would make a change.
- Where are my usual ones?

346
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,710
I know I'm a disappointment
to you, Molesley,

347
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,010
but it's no good.

348
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,780
I'll never get used to being dressed
like a doll.

349
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,620
- I'm only trying to help, sir.
- Of course.

350
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,020
And if I've offended
you, I apologise.

351
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,930
But surely you have
better things to do.

352
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,960
This is my job, sir.

353
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,280
Well, it seems a very silly
occupation for a grown man.

354
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,180
Look, I'm sorry if I'm...

355
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,320
Why are you so against him?

357
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,120
Aside from the fact he's
planning to steal our inheritance?

358
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,840
Your inheritance.

359
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,080
It makes no difference
to Sybil and me.

360
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,950
We won't inherit, whatever happens.

361
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,140
He isn't one of us.

362
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,260
Cousin Freddy's
studying for the bar.

363
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,780
And so is Vivian MacDonald.

364
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,060
At Lincoln's Inn!

365
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,510
Not sitting at a dirty
little desk in Ripon.

366
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,890
Besides, his father was a doctor.

367
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,250
There's nothing wrong with doctors.
We all need doctors.

368
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
We all need crossing sweepers
and draymen too,

369
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,900
it doesn't mean
we have to dine with them.

370
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,850
Whom don't we have to dine with?

371
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,710
Mary doesn't care for
Cousin Matthew.

372
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,300
Sybil, be a dear and fetch
my black evening shawl.

373
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,960
O'Brien knows which one.

374
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,780
And Edith, can you see that
the drawing room's ready?

375
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm glad to catch you alone.

376
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,950
- You've driven the others away.
- Perhaps I have.

377
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
Pretty.

378
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,670
The point is, my dear, I
don't want you, any of you,

379
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,950
to feel you have to dislike Matthew.

380
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,500
- You disliked the idea of him.
- That was before he came.

381
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,420
Now he's here, I don't
see any future in it.

382
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,640
Not the way things are.

383
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,480
I don't believe a woman can be
forced to give away all her money

384
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,280
to a distant cousin
of her husband's.

385
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,240
Not in the 20th century.
It's too ludicrous for words.

386
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,680
It's not as simple as that.
The money isn't mine anymore.

387
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,530
- It forms a part of the estate.
- Even so, when a judge hears...

388
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,120
For once in your life,
will you please just listen!

389
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,100
I believe there's an answer.

390
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,180
Which would secure your future
and give you a position.

391
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,510
You can't be serious.

392
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,060
Just think about it.

393
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,860
I don't have to think about it!

394
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,270
Marry a man who can barely hold
his knife like a gentleman?!

395
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
Oh, you exaggerate!

396
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,300
You're American, you don't
understand these things.

397
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,710
Have you mentioned this
to Granny? Did she laugh?

398
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,270
Why would she? It was her idea.

399
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,450
Have you been able to explore
the village?

400
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,800
Indeed I have.
And I thought the hospital

401
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,820
a great credit to
your father's memory.

402
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,550
But I'm afraid the good doctor
and I did not see eye to eye.

403
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,700
Oh! You amaze me!

404
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,580
He's treating one of your
tenants, John Drake, for dropsy.

405
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,940
But seems reluctant to embrace
some of the newer treatments.

406
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,480
Drake is a good man and
far too young to die,

407
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,890
but I suppose the doctor
knows his business.

408
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,770
Not as well as Mrs.
Crawley, apparently.

409
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,010
By the way, if ever you want
to ride, just let Lynch know

410
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,100
and he'll sort it out for you.

411
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,140
Oh, Papa,
Cousin Matthew doesn't ride.

412
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,200
I ride.

413
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,670
- And do you hunt?
- No, I don't hunt.

414
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,870
I dare say there's not much
opportunity in Manchester!

415
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,940
Are you a hunting family?

416
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,420
Families like ours are
always hunting families.

417
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,600
Not always. Billy Skelton
won't have them on his land.

418
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,130
But all the Skeltons are mad.

419
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,790
- Do you hunt?
- Occasionally.

420
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,480
I suppose you're more interested
in books than country sports.

421
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,800
I probably am.

422
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,030
You'll tell me that's
rather unhealthy.

423
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,140
Not unhealthy. Just unusual.

424
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,190
Among our kind of people.

425
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm changing round
the dessert services.

426
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,650
We're missing a sugar sifter.
I know I put three out.

427
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,090
I was talking to Anna earlier.

428
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,890
Why? What's she been saying?

429
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,720
- Whatever's the matter?
- What did Anna say?

430
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,220
Only that she thinks
Thomas is bullying William.

431
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,590
Ah. Yes, she may have a point.

432
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,920
I'll keep an eye out.

433
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,260
Here it is.

434
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,650
I've been studying the story of
Andromeda. Do you know it?

435
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,950
- Why?
- Her father was King Cepheus,

436
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,850
whose country was
being ravaged by storms.

437
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,950
And in the end, he decided
the only way to appease the gods

438
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,860
was to sacrifice his eldest daughter
to a hideous sea monster.

439
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,950
So they chained her
naked to a rock...

440
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,720
Really, Mary!

441
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,310
We'll all need our
smelling salts in a minute.

442
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,040
But the sea monster
didn't get her, did he?

443
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
No.

444
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000
Just when it seemed he was the only
solution to her father's problems,

445
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,670
she was rescued.

446
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,740
- By Perseus.
- That's right.

447
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,320
Perseus.

448
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,680
Son of a god.

449
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,580
Rather more fitting,
wouldn't you say?

450
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,490
That depends.

451
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,820
I'd have to know more about the
princess and the sea monster in question.

452
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,660
I wish I could dance like that.

453
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,150
Like what?

454
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,540
Don't you know the Grizzly Bear?

455
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,410
The Grizzly Bear! As if you do.

456
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,280
Certainly I do. Miss
O'Brien, shall we show them?

457
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,820
Not likely!

458
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
William, give us a tune.
Come on, Daisy.

459
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,480
Hands up.

460
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,660
Daisy! Daisy!

461
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,580
Stop that silly nonsense
before you put your joints out!

462
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,770
See to the range and go to bed.

463
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,590
Thank you. That was beautiful.

464
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,360
I'm sorry, Mary was
rather sharp this evening.

465
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,380
I doubt if Cousin Mary and I
are destined to be close friends.

466
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,950
I don't blame her.

467
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,580
Her father's home and her mother's
fortune are to be passed to me.

468
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,810
It's very harsh.

469
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,510
Well, what would you say...

470
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,870
... if the entail were
set aside in Mary's favour?

471
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,180
I should try to accept it with
as good a grace as I could muster.

472
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:18,840
Would you?

473
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,600
Good evening, Taylor.

474
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,260
- Good evening, m'lady.
- Thank you.

475
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,490
I'll say good night, Mr. Carson.

476
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,960
Look at that scratch.

477
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,630
I'll have to get that sorted
out while they're up in London.

478
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,640
- You can hardly see it.
- Well, I'll know it's there.

479
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,140
Are you alright now? Only you
seemed a little upset earlier.

480
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,710
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
I'm just um...

481
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
... a bit tired.

482
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,160
And no wonder.
Did the dinner go well?

483
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,610
Oh, well enough.

484
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,620
They won't make a match between
them, if that's what they're thinking.

485
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,530
Lady Mary doesn't like him.

486
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,900
And why should she like the
man she's been passed over for?

487
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,310
And why has she been?

488
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,300
- That's what I'd like to know.
- It's the law.

489
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,630
Well, it's a wicked law.

490
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,840
Why does Mr. Carson let you do that?

491
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,730
Because my dad was a clock maker.

492
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,670
Did you really ask him for
the job with the Crawleys?

493
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,780
I'm sick of being a footman.

494
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,780
I'd rather be a footman
than wait on someone

495
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,450
who ought to be a footman himself.

496
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,220
But Mr. Carson shouldn't
have told Bates.

497
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,690
How are things with Lady G?

498
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,150
Same as usual.

499
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,560
Yes m'lady, no m'lady,
three bags full.

500
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,840
I'd like to give her three bags
full, preferably on a dark night.

501
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,860
Will you hand in your notice?

502
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,160
And let her ruin me
with a nasty reference?

503
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,320
Oh, I think not.

504
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,300
I don't want to exaggerate. She's
been very generous, in many ways.

505
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,340
Generous?

506
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,410
To instruct you
in your own practice?

507
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,040
She may even have a point.

508
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,060
But it does not
seem to me realistic.

509
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,810
Well, nor is it!

510
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,070
Put an end to her meddling.

511
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,820
I am your President and
I say get rid of her.

512
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,100
Will that not be awkward?

513
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,980
She's planning to stay in the
village for the foreseeable future.

514
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,240
No one can foresee the future,
Doctor.

515
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,020
Not you, not I, and
certainly not Mrs. Crawley.

516
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,550
You do not love the place yet.

517
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,000
- Well, obviously it's...
- No, you don't love it.

518
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,050
You see a million
bricks that may crumble,

519
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,850
a thousand gutters and pipes
that may block and leak,

520
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,190
and stone that will
crack in the frost.

521
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,360
But you don't?

522
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,400
I see my life's work.

523
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Was it ever in danger?

524
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,950
Many times.

525
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,540
My dear Papa thought the balloon
would go up in the 1880s.

526
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,840
What saved it?

527
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,460
Cora.

528
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,970
Where is everyone?

529
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,280
They've gone down to the village.

530
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,440
Some travelling salesman set
up at the pub for the afternoon.

531
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,510
Alone at last.

532
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,530
We shouldn't be
without both footmen.

533
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,670
Does Mr. Carson know?

534
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,790
Mrs. Hughes does.
She's gone with them.

535
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,760
They won't be long.

536
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,260
So, you see to the girls

537
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,330
and you're supposed
to be head housemaid.

538
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,080
You should put in for a raise.

539
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,270
What do you mean "supposed to be"?

540
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,000
I said they shouldn't
have let both footmen go.

541
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,170
Well, you'll have to answer it.

542
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,630
Mr. Carson wouldn't like a
maid answering the front door.

543
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,580
Sorry to have kept
you waiting, sir.

544
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,470
I'm here to see Lord Grantham.

545
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,250
- Is he expecting you?
- No.

546
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,720
But he'll be very interested
in what I have to tell him.

547
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,730
His lordship is not at home, but
if you will leave your name...

548
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,340
Don't come all high
and mighty with me.

549
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,950
I don't know who you are, but
you're certainly not the butler

550
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,920
so don't try and make out you are.

551
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,020
How do you know?

552
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,370
Because Charlie Carson's
the butler round here.

553
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,800
Does your business concern him?

554
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
It might do.

555
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,480
Excuse me for one moment, sir.

556
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,200
Fetch Mr. Carson
as fast as you can.

557
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,750
Use the front door.

558
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
- If you would like to follow me, sir.
- No, no.

559
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,530
If you think you're
tucking me away somewhere

560
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,830
you've got another think coming.

561
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,950
- You'll be more comfortable, sir.
- Sorry, chum.

562
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,210
Oh, aye,

563
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,760
I'll not mind waiting in here.

564
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
Bates?

565
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,240
This gentlemen is an acquaintance
of Mr. Carson, m'lady.

566
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,150
What's he doing in here?

567
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,510
He says he has urgent
business with his lordship.

568
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Urgent.

569
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,570
I've sent for Mr.
Carson to come at once.

570
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,770
Then I'll stay with you.

571
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,290
In case explanations are needed.

572
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,390
(Thank you.)

573
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,750
Mr. Carson!

574
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,920
You're needed at
once in the library.

575
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,420
How long are you
expecting me to wait?

576
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,440
I'm a very busy man, you know.

577
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,180
If you could just be patient
for a little longer, sir.

578
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,410
May I ask who this is and
precisely what is going on?

579
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,860
<i>Mr. Bates, what are you...</i>

580
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,990
I'm sorry, your lordship.

581
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,530
- Mr. Bates, you may go now.
- Stay where you are.

582
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,730
Nobody's going anywhere.

583
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,290
Do I take it you know this man?

584
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,530
Don't try and deny it.

585
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,090
No, I won't deny it.

586
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,170
I do know him, my lord,

587
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,040
but not what he is
doing in the library.

588
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,070
I tried to take him downstairs out of
sight, Mr. Carson. But he wouldn't come.

589
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,710
Yes, thank you,
that was thoughtful.

590
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,250
But who is he?

591
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,220
Will you tell him, or shall I?

592
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,360
His name is Charles Grigg.

593
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,630
We worked together at one time.

594
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,290
Oh, I'm a little more than
that, aren't I, Charlie?

595
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,150
- We're like brothers, him and me.
- We are not like brothers.

596
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,510
We were a double act.

597
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,280
On the halls.

598
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,190
You were on the stage?!

599
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,180
Carson, is this true?

600
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,790
It is, my lord.

601
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,580
The Cheerful Charlies,
that's what they called us.

602
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,960
We did quite well, didn't we?

603
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,360
Until you couldn't keep
your hands out of the till.

604
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,460
- Would you like us to go, Mr. Carson?
- No.

605
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,100
You know it now.

606
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,050
You might as well bear witness
to my shame.

607
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,130
He turned up in the village
with no warning some days ago.

608
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,920
On the run. Asking for somewhere
to hide and, of course, for money.

609
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,930
God in heaven.

610
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,900
He is wanted for some petty crime,
of which he is, of course, guilty.

611
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:21,990
Here, steady on.

612
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,940
He threatened... to expose my past,

613
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,430
to make me a laughing
stock in this house.

614
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,010
And in my vanity and pride,

615
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,380
I gave him what he wanted.

616
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,040
You did not!

617
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
I put him in an empty cottage
and fed him from the kitchens.

618
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,860
I couldn't buy food in the village,

619
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,420
it would raise to many questions.

620
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,790
I stole.

621
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:47,850
I'm a thief.

622
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,930
She...saw it.

623
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,480
- I've never have said anything, Mr....
- And now my disgrace is complete.

624
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,210
My lord, you have my resignation.

625
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,880
Really, Carson, there's no need
to be quite so melodramatic.

626
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,690
You're not playing Sidney Carton.

627
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,980
So why have you come here

628
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,820
if he has done everything
you asked of him?

629
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,380
Because he hasn't.

630
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,380
He wouldn't give me any money.

631
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,190
If I had, how could I prevent
his returning to Downton

632
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,580
once it was spent?

633
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,440
My dear Mr. Grigg...

634
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,880
Oh, it's nice to see
someone's got some manners.

635
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,240
Hold your tongue!

636
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,330
I'll tell you what
is going to happen.

637
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,170
When I have given you £20, you
will leave Downton immediately

638
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,110
and we will never
set eyes on you again.

639
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,740
I'll have to see about that.

640
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,490
If you return to this area,

641
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,310
I will personally ensure your
conviction for theft and blackmail.

642
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,370
- Just a minute.
- You will serve from five to 10 years

643
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,000
in His Majesty's custody.

644
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,060
You think you're such
a big man, don't you?

645
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,960
Just cos you're a lord, you think
you can do what you like with me.

646
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,080
I think it...

647
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,650
... because it is true.

648
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:12,360
You'll not always be
in charge, you know!

649
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,650
The day is coming when your
lot will have to tow the line

650
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,880
- just like the rest of us!
- Perhaps.

651
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,200
But happily for Carson,

652
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,100
that day has not come yet.

653
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,750
I... take it my resignation
has not been accepted.

654
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,720
My dear fellow, we all have chapters
we would rather keep unpublished.

655
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,510
To be honest, Carson...

656
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,090
... I'm rather impressed.

657
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,990
Did you really sing and
dance in front of an audience?

658
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,800
I did.

659
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,780
And do you ever miss it?

660
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,340
Not in the least, my lord.

661
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,560
Poor Mr. Carson.

662
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,080
We'll have to treat him like a
god for a month to calm his nerves.

663
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,660
He'll be afraid this will
change the way we think of him.

664
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,790
- Then we mustn't let it.
- Oh, but it will.

665
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,290
The Cheerful Charlies?!

666
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,460
For all his talk of dignity,
we know his story now.

667
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,900
- And admire him more because of it.
- Maybe.

668
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,980
But it will change the way we
think of him. It always does.

669
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,680
I don't see why.

670
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,790
I shouldn't care what
I found out about you,

671
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,950
whatever it was.

672
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,110
It wouldn't alter
my opinion one bit.

673
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,250
But it would. It certainly would.

674
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,940
<i>We're running out of options!</i>

675
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,330
The lawyers I write
to only huff and puff.

676
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,230
They echo Murray and
say nothing can be done.

677
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,460
Or they don't want the
bother of opposing him.

678
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,280
Precisely.

679
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:53,440
I wish Mary wasn't so confident
it could all be put right.

680
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,100
Meanwhile, we have to watch
that dreadful woman

681
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:59,620
parade around the village
as if she owned it.

682
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,480
- I think she means well.
- Meaning well is not enough.

683
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,940
Poor Dr. Clarkson.

684
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,410
What has he done to
deserve that termagant?

685
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,160
I think he's in for an
uncomfortable afternoon.

686
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,970
Really? Why?

687
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,150
On my way here, I saw
her go into the hospital.

688
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,660
She looked extremely determined.

689
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,860
Not as determined as I am.

690
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,380
I have the adrenalin
here in my hand.

691
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,740
Will you really deny the
man his chance of life?

692
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,460
I just wish it was a treatment
I was more familiar with.

693
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,700
Will that serve as your
excuse when he dies?

694
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,800
Nurse!

695
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,710
Will you prepare Mr. Drake
for his procedure, please?

696
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,130
Well, Mrs. Crawley,

697
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,560
I have a feeling
we will sink or swim together.

698
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,260
Mr. Drake, your heart
is not functioning properly.

699
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,820
And as a result, the
pericardial sac is full of fluid.

700
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,380
I am proposing first
to withdraw the fluid

701
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,570
and then to inject the adrenalin
to stimulate the heart and

702
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,300
restore normal activity.

703
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,110
Is it dangerous, Doctor?

704
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:18,180
The draining may stop the heart.

705
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,210
And the adrenalin may
not be able to restart it.

706
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:24,190
Mrs. Drake, the choice is simple.

707
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,170
If your husband endures
this procedure, he may life.

708
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,620
If not, he will die.

709
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,980
<i>- He's with a patient.
- No, let me pass!</i>

710
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,290
<i>I must see the doctor...at once!</i>

711
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,680
Your ladyship.

712
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,930
It is just as I thought.

713
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,490
Doctor Clarkson,

714
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,050
tell me you will not
permit this amateur

715
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,240
to influence your
professional opinion.

716
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,050
- Amateur?
- My dear woman,

717
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,890
do not let them bully you.

718
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
They'll not disturb the peace
of your husband's last hours

719
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,490
if I can help it.

720
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,110
But that's just it, my lady.

721
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,450
I don't want them
to be his last hours.

722
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,990
Not if there's a chance.

723
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,080
Please, Doctor,

724
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,460
do what you must.

725
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,200
As...

726
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,720
Steady.

727
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,870
Yep, alright.

728
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,620
Nice and steady.

729
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,830
As President of this hospital,
I feel I must...

730
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,840
Valve.

731
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,180
..tell you...

732
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,280
... I shall bring this to
the attention of the board.

733
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,710
You're doing very well.

734
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,880
Have you no pity?

735
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,230
Adrenalin.

736
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,420
Quickly, quickly.

737
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,680
His heart's stopped.

738
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,420
Ready?

739
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Yes.

740
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,870
Oh, John!

741
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,000
My dear.

742
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,400
You don't have to worry...

743
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,620
she may be President,
but I am the Patron

744
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,480
so you're quite safe with me.
Please.

745
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,190
My mother was right, then.

746
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,250
The man's life was saved.

747
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,110
Well, I like to think
we were both right.

748
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,900
But I'm not sure Lady Grantham
will be so easily convinced.

749
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,760
Then we must
strengthen the argument.

750
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,760
Cousin Isobel wants
something to do? Very well.

751
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,600
Let's make her
Chairman of the Board.

752
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,620
- She'd like that, wouldn't she?
- Certainly she would.

753
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,950
Then my mother will
have to listen to her.

754
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,910
She's been an absolute
ruler there for long enough.

755
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,810
It's time for some loyal opposition.

756
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,120
Well, if you're quite
certain, my lord.

757
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,920
What were you going to say?

758
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,840
Well, at the risk
of being impertinent,

759
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,480
on your own head be it.

760
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,040
About your scheme for
restoring the estate cottages.

761
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,850
You don't mind my interfering?

762
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,060
My dear fellow,
I brought you here to interfere.

763
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,940
In fact, why don't you stay for
dinner and we'll talk about it?

764
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,750
We'll send down to
Molesley for your clothes.

765
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,810
I better not.
My mother's expecting me.

766
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,520
In fact, I've been meaning to
speak to you about Molesley.

767
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,270
Would you find me very ungrateful
if I dispensed with his services?

768
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,250
Why? Has he displeased you
in some way?

769
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,880
Not at all. It's simply that he's
superfluous to our style of living.

770
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,650
Is that quite fair?

771
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,600
To deprive a man of his livelihood
when he's done nothing wrong?

772
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,100
- Well, I wouldn't quite put it...
- Your mother derives satisfaction

773
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,590
from her work at the hospital, I
think, some sense of self-worth?

774
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,090
- Well, certainly.
- Would you really

775
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,420
deny the same to poor old Molesley?

776
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,340
And when you are master here, is the
butler to be dismissed, or the footman?

777
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,550
How many maids or kitchen
staff will be allowed to stay?

778
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,560
Or must every one be driven out?

779
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:32,480
We all have different
parts to play, Matthew.

780
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,480
And we must all be
allowed to play them.

781
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,180
<i>Why must we all go to the hospital?</i>

782
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,160
I'm afraid Papa wants
to teach Granny a lesson.

783
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,040
Poor Granny. A month ago,
these people were strangers.

784
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:56,300
Now she must share power with the
mother and I must marry the son.

785
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,450
You won't marry him
though, will you?

786
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,150
What, marry a sea monster?

787
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,490
We shouldn't laugh.
That's so unkind.

788
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,430
But he must marry someone.

789
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,390
Edith, what are you thinking?

790
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,140
You know, I don't dislike
him as much as you do.

791
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,240
Perhaps you don't
dislike him at all.

792
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,780
Perhaps I don't.

793
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,990
Well, it's nothing to me.
I've bigger fish to fry.

794
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,460
What fish? Are we talking about E-N?

795
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,550
How do you know that? Have you
been poking around in my things?

796
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,390
Of course not. Come on.

797
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,100
Who is he? It's not
fair if you both know.

798
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,380
You won't be any the wiser,
but his name is Evelyn Napier.

799
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,690
The Honourable Evelyn Napier.

800
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,600
Son and heir to Viscount Branksome.

801
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,410
Who wants an old sea monster
when they can have Perseus?

802
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,960
If you're going to the ceremony,
I thought we might walk together.

803
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,220
Certainly I'm going.

804
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,250
I want to see the old bat's
face when they announce it.

805
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,370
I must try not to
look too cheerful.

806
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,980
Or shouldn't I talk like
that in your presence?

807
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,090
Do you find me very ridiculous,
Mrs. Hughes?

808
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,110
Putting on airs and
graces I've no right to?

809
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,640
What's brought this on?

810
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,820
Nothing.

811
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:15,310
Except at times I wonder
if I'm just a sad old fool.

812
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,360
Mr. Carson,

813
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,100
you are a man of
integrity and honour,

814
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,720
who raises the tone of this
household by being part of it.

815
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,520
So no more of that, please.

816
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,060
<i>Come on! We mustn't be late!</i>

817
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,650
I wondered if you'd like
to walk with me down to...

818
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,150
Is Thomas going?

819
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,410
Well, I think everyone is.

820
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,930
Sorry, what were you saying?

821
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,180
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

822
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:46,730
Put this away before you go.

823
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:50,840
- And never mind your flirting!
- I wasn't flirting. Not with him.

824
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,390
William's not a bad lad.

825
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,380
He's nice enough,
but he isn't like Thomas.

826
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,320
No, he's not.

827
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,330
Cuff links, sir?

828
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,330
Those are a dull option
for such an occasion.

829
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,540
Don't you agree?

830
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,910
Might I suggest the
crested pair, sir?

831
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,260
They seem more appropriate,
if you don't mind me saying.

832
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,100
They're a bit fiddly. I
wonder if you could help me.

833
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:22,650
Certainly, sir.

834
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,930
Oh, I see you got that mark out
of the sleeve. How did you do it?

835
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,390
I tried it with this and tried
it with that until it yielded.

836
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,490
Very well done.

837
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,330
Thank you, sir.

838
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,040
You go in, Mrs. Hughes. I want
a quick word with Mr. Bates here.

839
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:06,320
Mr. Bates.

840
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,020
I must thank you,

841
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,410
both for what you did
and for keeping silent afterwards.

842
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,170
It was kind of you, and Anna.

843
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,750
It was nothing, Mr. Carson.

844
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,030
Well, I hope you don't
judge me too harshly.

845
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,300
I don't judge you at all. I have
no right to judge you, or any man.

846
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:43,120
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this happy event..

847
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,750
the investiture of our first
Chairwoman, Mrs. Reginald Crawley,

848
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,890
who has graciously agreed to share
the duties of our beloved President,

849
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,280
the Dowager Countess of Grantham.

850
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,900
Our little hospital must
surely grow and thrive

851
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,620
with two such doughty
champions united as they are

852
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,150
by the strongest ties of
all... family and friendship.

853
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,190
Lady Mary Crawley, I presume.

854
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,670
Mary has more suitors tonight
than the Princess Aurora.

855
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,160
Is that one mine?

856
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,630
I hope the day's living
up to your expectations.

857
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,760
Exceeding them in every way.

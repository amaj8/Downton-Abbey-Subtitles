1
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
~ Did you sleep well? ~ Very.

2
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,750
It hasn't taken me long to get used
to sharing a bed again.

3
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,350
~ Who is it? ~ Breakfast, madam.

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
One moment.

5
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,190
Ah. Thank you so much.

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I can manage.

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,230
Have you ordered something
for yourself? You can't have mine.

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,030
It'll be here any second.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,910
~ You've worked up a good appetite.
~ I can't bear vulgar jokes.

10
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,880
I'll make note of that. I've made
note of everything.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,870
How you look in the morning. How you
dress.

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,910
How you put on your make-up.

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Why particularly?

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,710
Because I want to acclimate myself

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,830
with the routines and rituals that
will govern the rest of my life.

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,150
Are you governed by ritual and
routine?

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,350
~ I don't think I am. ~ Do you really
have to leave today?

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
I'm afraid so.

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,150
Surely there are delights
in Liverpool we have yet to share.

20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,870
We've driven round Cheshire and
dined in public for almost a week.

21
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,550
By some miracle, we have managed to
get away with it.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,030
~ Let's not push our luck.
~ Does it matter if we get found out?

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,830
~ We're gonna be down the aisle before
you can say, "Jack Robinson." ~ No.

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,630
And yes, it does matter.

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,510
I've been tarnished once and I won't
be tarnished again.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,590
Nothing is going to happen that
isn't properly announced

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,590
organised and executed.

28
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
Isn't that your breakfast?

29
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,470
Miss Bunting says I've quite a gift
for it now I've got started.

30
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,510
I left school when I were 11.

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,630
What were I supposed to learn by
then?

32
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,230
If I were at school now, I'd be
there at least till I were 14.

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,350
What's the matter?

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,920
~ Sorry, love. What were you saying?
~ Nothing.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,390
Before he left, Mr Bricker said he
wants to show us the della
Francescas

36
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,230
in the National Gallery when we're
next in London.

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,510
You go. Actually, I wouldn't mind
knowing if ours is any good.

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,750
We don't often see you for
breakfast.

39
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,430
We've got a meeting to organise the
church flowers.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,030
~ The rota seems to have gone wrong.
~ Is Mary back today?

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,630
~ Supposed to be. ~ Good. ~ We've been
sent a proposition from
a man in Leeds.

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,920
~ What's that? ~ Let's wait till Mary
gets home then we can talk about it.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,030
~ Do you have any plans? ~ I may walk
down to Yew Tree Farm.

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,830
~ I'll give you a lift if you like.
~ Has Rose left? ~ I think so.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,350
She planned to get an early train to
York.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,350
She wanted to spend the day with her
Russians which is nice.

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you ready to go?

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,510
Edith is getting so fond of that
little girl.

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,880
I only hope she isn't driving
the mother mad.

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,750
Mr Carson, please may I make a
telephone call?

51
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,470
Don't make it a habit.

52
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,190
I'm sorry to ask but I wonder if I
might be alone.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,920
If you wish.

54
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,710
Hello. I've read your advertisement
in the London Magazine.

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,280
Choose Your Own Path.

56
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,920
This is me. We'll talk soon.

57
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,440
We're settled now. We just have to
get organised.

58
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,510
Oh, what is the latest
from your ageing Romeo?

59
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,150
If it's of interest, I haven't heard
anything from him

60
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,510
~ since you and I last met.
~ Oh, how disappointing.

61
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,750
To you, perhaps.
Not especially to me.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,110
~ By the way, how is Spratt?
~ He's well, I think. Why do you ask?

63
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,870
He wasn't there to open the door. I
wondered if he might be ill.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,670
Oh, no. He's not ill. He's in
Liverpool.

65
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,870
His niece got married yesterday

66
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,510
~ and Spratt had to take her down the
aisle. ~ Oh.

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,630
It seems unlikely to think of Spratt
with a private life.

68
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,950
Hm. Yes. Unlikely and extremely
inconvenient.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,670
But you can't begrudge him that.
Servants are human beings too.

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,270
Yes. But preferably only on their
days off.

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,950
So they want to take this witness
business further?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,110
I'm afraid so. It's a young woman,
apparently.

73
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,990
She was on her way to meet a friend
by the Statue of Eros in Piccadilly.

74
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,750
Now, she swears she heard Green
speak as she walked by.

75
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,550
There was clatter from traffic but
she heard him say,

76
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,590
"Why have you come?"

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,630
~ Who was he talking to?
~ She couldn't see.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,710
She was quite short and behind his
back. She looked up when he spoke

79
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,430
~ but it was only to see him fall into
the road. ~ She kept quiet.

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,630
Well, it was in the paper and they
said it was an accident.

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,950
But that phrase haunted her.
"Why have you come?"

82
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,200
~ Till she felt she had to report it.
~ I still don't see what brings you here.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,350
Green complained of a quarrel

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,710
while he was staying at Downton.

85
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,390
He felt badly treated, was angry
about it and...

86
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,310
~ he told Lord Gillingham's other servants.
~ Why didn't they report it?

87
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,270
Because everyone thought his death
was an accident.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,310
Until now.

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,110
I'm sorry but as I remember, he was
in high spirits while he was here.

90
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,790
Rather too high, if you get my meaning.

91
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,950
He had the maids and footmen playing
Racing Demon

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,990
and screaming the house down.

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,270
~ So you had no reason to believe he
fell out with anyone? ~ None at all.

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,870
He was rather a bumptious type

95
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,960
but if anyone objected to that,
it was me.

96
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,870
Isobel was asking about your travels.

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,990
She's coming for dinner this evening
so you can tell her yourself.

98
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,310
~ Another cup of tea, M'Lord?
~ Thank you, no.

99
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,830
You can show her your sketches.
Where are they anyway?

100
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,910
~ Can't we see them?
~ Now that you're back,

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,510
a building company has been in
touch.

102
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,550
~ They want to put up 50 houses. ~ 50?

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,670
Modest ones. He's got his eye on
Pip's Corner.

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,550
He wants to widen the lane to the
green

105
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,230
~ to access the village centre.
~ They want to buy Pip's Corner?

106
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,430
They want to build on Pip's Corner.
We take a percentage of sales.

107
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,350
~ It's a good offer. ~ I won't have 50
ugly modern houses

108
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,710
built over a field of mine.

109
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,080
Well, we don't have to make a
decision now.

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,950
~ Hello, darling. ~ Hello, Sybbie. ~ Now,
let's go and sit by the fire.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,960
We want to hear all about your...

112
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,840
~ The police must have muddled Downton
with some other place. ~ I expect so.

113
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,160
~ You don't remember any bad feeling
involving Mr Green, do you? ~ No.

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, better get moving. They'll be
down in a minute.

115
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,550
Oh, Mr Carson. There's a telephone
call for Mr Barrow.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Go and find him, Mr Molesley, seeing
as you're the First Footman now.

117
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,350
~ Are you free for a moment?
~ I've not got long.

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,840
No, well, it won't take long.

119
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,630
I've had a letter from my sister.

120
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,070
The mother of my nephew Archie.

121
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,390
~ He was shot, wasn't he, poor boy.
~ Yes. He was shot. For cowardice.

122
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,390
His parents live in Farsley near
Leeds.

123
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,870
Now, the Farsley people are putting
up their own memorial like we are.

124
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,670
~ That's nice. ~ Well, it is and it
isn't.

125
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,670
You see, the locals only know that
Archie died in the War.

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,430
~ They'll expect to see his name among
the rest. ~ Yes.

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,670
But the committee won't put him on
the list.

128
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,710
He's... He's not worthy.

129
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,520
Apparently. So says the War Office.

130
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,950
I am sorry. That must be terribly
upsetting for her.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,470
Well, it brings it back for us, you
see.

132
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,990
It brings it back
and makes his death nothing at all.

133
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,350
~ I wish I could do something. ~ Well, I
did just wonder...

134
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,310
I mean, if she were able to say he'd
been included in our memorial,

135
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,270
because of a family connection,
no-one would wonder

136
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,470
why he was missing from the one in
Farsley.

137
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,430
~ Have you spoken to Mr Carson? ~ No.
I was hoping you might do that.

138
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,630
~ Me? ~ Well, everyone knows you can
twist him around your little finger.

139
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,430
Then, EVERYONE is wrong.

140
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,430
Well, will you have a go, please?

141
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,150
We're about to start the Hollandaise.

142
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,080
~ So we've got time if it curdles.
~ Right. I'm coming.

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,960
Please.

144
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,950
I hope you're not too tired after
your exertions.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,030
Ooh, M'Lady. I'm not tired exactly.

146
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,710
Oh, good. I'm glad if the wedding was
a success.

147
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,430
Oh. The wedding was a success.

148
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,550
Yes.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,110
Spratt, I have told you before, I do
not appreciate a man of mystery.

150
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,550
If you have something to say, say
it.

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,510
I would, Your Ladyship, but it may
not be quite right for me to tell.

152
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, if that is the case
then do NOT say it.

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,710
Do you have some other business?

154
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,550
Only that it may not be mine to
tell,

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,270
but it is, in a way, yours.

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,150
You're testing me, Spratt.

157
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,550
And I warn you, being tested does
not bring out the best in me.

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,230
~ No, Your Ladyship. ~ I will not repeat
myself.

159
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,550
Either impart this piece of
information,

160
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,190
if you can empower yourself
to do so,

161
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,670
or go.

162
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Very well.

163
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,270
I hope Lady Mary enjoyed her time in
Liverpool.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,390
~ What? ~ I was standing outside the
Grand Hotel this morning, M'Lady,

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,470
when I saw her come out with her
suitcases.

166
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,230
She was accompanied by Lord
Gillingham

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,360
who had clearly also been staying in
the hotel.

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,160
Well, yes. They were both staying
there.

169
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,230
They were attending an informal
conference of northern landowners.

170
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,190
Lord Gillingham thought Lady Mary
might derive benefit from it.

171
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,230
So you knew about it?

172
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,280
Of course I did.

173
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,030
Why?

174
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,590
What do you imagine you were
witnessing?

175
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,760
~ Well... ~ Nothing vulgar, I hope!

176
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,110
Nothing beneath the dignity of a
butler of this house.

177
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,320
Oh. Nothing...of...that...sort,
M'Lady.

178
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm glad to hear it.

179
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,310
Now, if you'll be good enough to let
me drink my brandy in peace.

180
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Your Ladyship.

181
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,180
You don't think Mr Bates ever knew
it was Mr Green, do you?

182
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
What are you asking me for?

183
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,410
I don't know anything you don't
know.

184
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:03,210
Anyway, Mr Carson wasn't impressed
by the sound of the witness.

185
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,850
But they could make out he was
in London that day, couldn't they?

186
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
He left at dawn. He was back late.

187
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,570
They'll say he could have managed
it.

188
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,210
Even if Mr Bates was in London, we
have no reason to suppose

189
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,780
~ he had anything to do with it. ~ What
do you mean, 'even if he was'?

190
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,730
~ Do you think he was? ~ I don't know if
he was there or not.

191
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Why would I if you don't?

192
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,210
They'll find out.

193
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
About Mr Green.

194
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,220
~ They'll find out what he did.
~ How?

195
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,650
There's no-one in this house knows,
except you, me and Lady Mary.

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
And she won't give it away.

197
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,570
~ No, I don't think she will. ~ There
you are, then.

198
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,620
But they'll find out somehow.

199
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,210
Of course you must bring them. If
you want to.

200
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,740
~ They do so love an excursion.
~ It'll be fun. I'll come and help.

201
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,730
What are you going to do in London?

202
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,250
I have a fitting with Monsieur
Molyneux. He's over from Paris.

203
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,050
~ The Dowager Lady Grantham is on the
telephone for you, M'Lady.
~ Thank you.

204
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,290
~ Will you stay at Rosamund's?
~ If she'll have me.

205
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,450
~ Robert, any chance you could come
to? ~ I'm afraid I can't.

206
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,490
I've a dreary meeting all afternoon.

207
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,170
What about you, Edith? I'm taking Mr
Bricker up on his offer

208
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,530
~ to show me the National Gallery.
~ I'm watching little Marigold.

209
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,930
Mrs Drewe is taking the youngest boy
to the dentist.

210
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,570
~ Can't someone else step in? ~ I said
I'd do it. ~ Rose.

211
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,330
We're taking my Russians to Howarth
where the Brontes lived.

212
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,890
~ What will they make of the Brontes?
~ Good things surely.

213
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,610
Hopeless lovers wandering over a
desolate moor.

214
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,610
If it wasn't Emily Bronte, it could
be Tolstoy or Gogol.

215
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,530
That's why I want to bring them to
Downton.

216
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,410
They can compare the old Chekhovian
vie de chateau

217
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:52,690
~ with the way the English do it.
~ Won't that make them unhappy?

218
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,810
A little nostalgic maybe but they
seem to enjoy that.

219
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,410
We have some Russian things here from
when Papa and Mama went in 1874.

220
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,410
I shall look them out. What did your
grandmother want?

221
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,450
She wondered if I'll have time to
look in tomorrow. That's all.

222
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,850
I hope your flurry of telephonic
communication

223
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,980
does not involve bad news, Mr
Barrow.

224
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,970
My father's ill, Mr Carson.

225
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,410
Oh, I am sorry.
Will you need time off?

226
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,330
Well, I ought to leave in the
morning.

227
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,690
~ Really? ~ If you want me to see him
alive. ~ Oh, my heaven.

228
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,220
Of course I do.
Of course you must go.

229
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,410
I'm sorry to hear it.
I remember your father very well.

230
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,650
Don't pretend. You couldn't care
less.

231
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,090
I've known your family for a good
long time.

232
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,020
I may not want to be your spy but
nothing changes that.

233
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,970
~ If you say so. ~ Your dad was always
kind to me. ~ Was he?

234
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,010
Because he was never very kind to
me.

235
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,290
~ You're quiet. ~ Am I? I don't mean to
be.

236
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,370
I was thinking we might get out for
a night when we're due time off.

237
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,730
Somewhere peaceful. Away from here.

238
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,810
Do you ever wonder what it would be
like to go

239
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,850
to a place where no-one knows us?

240
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,130
~ And just start again. ~ Why do you say
that?

241
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,490
I'm being stupid.

242
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,090
That's why.

243
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,420
I hear you're getting on well with
your mathematics, Daisy.

244
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,770
~ An extra feather in your cap.
~ Yes, it is.

245
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,770
~ But now I wonder... ~ You wonder what?
~ Well, should I stop there?

246
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,700
That's enough, Daisy. Come and carry
the spotted dick.

247
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Good night, Baxter.

248
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,370
M'Lady, I hope you don't mind but I
would like to know

249
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,370
whether I'm staying or going.

250
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,970
You're right. I have made you wait
an unreasonable time.

251
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,850
I just feel I need to plan if you've
come to a decision.

252
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
I have. I think I have.

253
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,890
Tomorrow I want you tell me
the missing element of your story.

254
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
If you do, I'll give you a decision.

255
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,410
~ Is everything planned for the trip?
~ It is.

256
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,090
~ I'm looking forward to it. ~ Really?

257
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,250
I'm afraid I find those journeys a
slog these days.

258
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,450
~ Do you ever think of the War?
~ What do you mean?

259
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,250
How it was. When the girls were
working with the officers

260
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,930
and I was running everything with
Barrow.

261
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,770
I don't remember Mary doing much.

262
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,770
Sometimes I find myself thinking how
busy we were. How useful.

263
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,420
~ You can't wish those days back again.
~ Well...

264
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,620
..I wouldn't admit it outside this
room.

265
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,890
What was that business about
building houses at Pip's Corner?

266
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,100
Nothing to trouble you with.

267
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,370
~ So you had fun? ~ Don't ask me to
elaborate.

268
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,810
Have you set the date?
For the wedding, M'Lady.

269
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,250
~ No. ~ He's not trying to get out of it?
~ No.

270
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,890
But there's no hurry. We don't have
to rush into it.

271
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,650
By the way, would you do me
the greatest possible favour?

272
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,130
~ I will if I can. ~ Would you hide this
in the cottage?

273
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,610
~ You mean the thing. ~ Well, I can't
leave it here.

274
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,570
Suppose Mrs Hughes found it. Or
Edith. Or Mama.

275
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,890
Please take it. And the book.

276
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,010
There must be a corner cupboard
in the cottage where no-one goes.

277
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,620
~ Very well, M'Lady. ~ Thank you.

278
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,890
But I do feel I'm aiding and
abetting a sin.

279
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,700
I just hope I won't be made to pay.

280
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,970
I gather the local bobby was here
today.

281
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,810
Carson said a witness had turned
up who'd seen that man die.

282
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,010
But wasn't it a crowded pavement?
Surely there were hundreds of them.

283
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,570
This one says she heard Mr Green
talking just before he fell.

284
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,330
Sergeant Willis was asking if he'd
quarrelled with anyone

285
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,570
~ when he was at Downton. ~ Why?

286
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,610
Mr Green had told the people he
worked with

287
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,170
that he'd been treated badly while
he was here.

288
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,900
~ HE was treated badly?! ~ I know.
But...

289
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,410
..we have to be on our guard.

290
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,650
I mean, I'm sure Mr Bates never knew
it was him

291
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,130
but if they find out what Mr Green
did, then...

292
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,020
There can't be any evidence against
Bates. They'd have found it by now.

293
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,970
What are you doing?

294
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,820
~ Nothing. ~ Is this some mysterious
present for me?

295
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,770
~ No, it's something of Lady Mary's.
~ What is it?

296
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,330
That's private. For her.

297
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,170
~ Then why has she given it to you?
~ She wants me to keep it.

298
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,620
~ Why are you putting me off?
~ I'm not doing any such thing.

299
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,410
Add the name of a coward to our
memorial?

300
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,450
Are you quite well?

301
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,930
Mr Carson, surely by now we know
enough about shellshock

302
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,290
to be more understanding than
we were at the start of the War.

303
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,450
Look, I don't mean to sound cruel but
the lad was troubled

304
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,490
and off his head for all we know.

305
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,410
I'm sorry for him. I'm sorry for his
family and for Mrs Patmore.

306
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,370
~ Well, then. ~ But is it fair to the
millions of men

307
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,130
who stood by their posts up to their
waists in mud,

308
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,330
terrified out of their wits
yet determined to do their best

309
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,010
~ for King and country? 
~ What do you mean?

310
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,570
Is it fair to say to them,
"Your sacrifice weighs just the same

311
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,810
as the man who abandoned his duty
and ran for it"?

312
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,930
~ I... ~ I'm sorry, Mrs Hughes, but I
don't think it's right

313
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,940
to make so little of the gift those
young men gave us when they died.

314
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,860
I see.

315
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,770
~ I hoped I'd catch you before we go.
~ Oh, yes?

316
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
She's given me an ultimatum.

317
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,650
~ What's she said? ~ I must either tell
her the rest of my story or leave.

318
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,490
And if you do tell her, does that
mean you can stay?

319
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,530
She wouldn't commit herself.

320
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,010
~ So what will you do? ~ I don't know.

321
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,890
There is a story, and maybe she has
a right to hear it.

322
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,730
But once it's told, I want it back
in the ground and buried.

323
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,650
~ Then make that your condition. ~ What?

324
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,770
She's made conditions so can you.
The worst that can happen

325
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,810
is that she refuses and you go.

326
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,900
Which will happen anyway if you say
nothing. Oh.

327
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,770
You don't think he'll relent?

328
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,810
I'm afraid not.

329
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,700
I just wanted to be sure you knew
there'll only be four for dinner.

330
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,690
She's told you, then.

331
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,850
~ I have. ~ They'd never have allowed
it.

332
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,890
~ Is that so? ~ But I don't want you to
think I'm unsympathetic.

333
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:51,570
Yes, well... Sympathy butters no
parsnips.

334
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,610
I'd better get on.

335
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,650
What's the matter with her?

336
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,690
She's had bad news.

337
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,770
~ Oh, by the way, Mr Carson...
~ Yes, Daisy.

338
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,690
..you wouldn't mind if I were to sit
an examination, would you?

339
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,530
~ Not now. But when I'm ready.
~ That's a question for Mrs Patmore

340
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,010
~ or Mrs Hughes. ~ But you don't object?

341
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,530
Well, since you ask, I'm not
convinced any of this extra work

342
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,090
is necessary for your place in the
scheme of things.

343
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,130
Mr Carson, Sergeant Willis is here.

344
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,380
Hm.

345
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,500
My advice Daisy is to go as far in
life as God and luck allow.

346
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,250
Are you sure about this? I'm never
convinced surprises

347
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,730
~ are all they're cracked up to be.
~ Don't be silly.

348
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,170
I'll give her a treat.
I thought we might go dancing.

349
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,370
I hear the new band at Claridge's is
marvellous.

350
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,890
~ Does Aunt Rosamund know you're
coming? ~ I'll tell her when I arrive.

351
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,490
They were just going to have supper
together and go to bed. Bates.

352
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,770
Mr Carson said you were looking for
me, M'Lord.

353
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,330
My meeting's been cancelled.
I've decided to run up to London.

354
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,890
Would you make up a bag for me?
Black tie not white.

355
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,290
~ Would you like me to come with you?
~ No need. I'll be back tomorrow.

356
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,850
~ Mr Bates? ~ Well, that's it. He didn't
like Mr Bates. Not at all.

357
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,650
And we know now that he said so to
Lord Gillingham's butler.

358
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,090
Well, I don't remember that.
He mentioned Mr Bates by name?

359
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,490
He called him 'the valet' and there
isn't another, is there?

360
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,690
~ Not now. ~ You do surprise me.
Mr Bates keeps himself to himself.

361
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,850
~ You won't mind if I talk to him?
~ Not at all. Be my guest.

362
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,010
You can take a seat and I'll send
for him.

363
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
Thank you, Spratt.

364
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,460
I trust you enjoyed your stay in
Liverpool, M'Lady?

365
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:36,330
You found it extremely interesting,
didn't you, dear?

366
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,130
Yes, I did.

367
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,050
I think we'll have some tea. Thank
you, Spratt.

368
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,220
Very good, Your Ladyship.

369
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,930
Obviously, it's very shocking
to someone of your generation.

370
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,930
Don't let us hide behind the changing
times, my dear.

371
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,650
~ This is shocking to most people in
1924. ~ Yes.

372
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,490
Can we be confident that there will
be no unwanted epilogue?

373
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,380
You can be quite sure.

374
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Well, I must say that makes a nice...

375
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,650
A nice what?

376
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,290
A nice kettle of fish.

377
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,090
~ Is there any chance of a proposal?
~ Every chance.

378
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,570
He already has.
He wants to set the date.

379
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,370
Oh. Oh, I see.

380
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,930
Well, I'm not saying I approve
because I don't.

381
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,250
But it does put things in rather a
different light.

382
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,090
Yes.

383
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,010
~ When will you announce it?
~ I'm not sure. We haven't decided.

384
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,050
Then you'd better get on with it.

385
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,330
If I was seduced by a man,

386
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,490
I would not let any grass grow
under his feet

387
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,090
~ if he'd offered to do the decent
thing. ~ I wasn't seduced, Granny.

388
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,770
A young woman of good family who
finds herself in the bed

389
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,770
of a man who is not her husband has
invariably been seduced.

390
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,010
She couldn't have gone to bed with
him of her own free will?

391
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,810
NOT if she was the daughter of an
Earl.

392
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,330
Oh, there you are, Spratt.

393
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,370
Lady Mary's been telling me all
about her conference.

394
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,450
I hope you found it interesting,
M'Lady.

395
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,060
I learned a great deal that I never
knew before.

396
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,900
Thank you, Spratt.

397
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,450
You've had the journey to think
about, Baxter,

398
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,570
and I accept your condition. We have
time.

399
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,540
I don't have to be anywhere till
later.

400
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,410
At the house in Ovington Square,
there was a footman.

401
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
His name was Coyle. Peter Coyle.

402
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,170
He was very handsome and after a
while,

403
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,500
I could do nothing but by his
permission.

404
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,660
He was a cruel man although I
couldn't see it then.

405
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,860
At least...

406
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,370
..I could see it, really.

407
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,810
He was nasty. And he made me nasty.

408
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,290
And I embraced it.

409
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,330
Tell me about the robbery.

410
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,850
He handed in his notice and on his
last night, I took the jewels.

411
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,210
He wanted them all but I only took
some.

412
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,250
And you gave them to him and he
left.

413
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,290
He said where to meet him the next
day and I thought he'd be there.

414
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,890
~ But he never came. ~ I never saw him
after. He got clean away.

415
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,730
And you took the blame but why?

416
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,170
I was ashamed.

417
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,330
I'd let him change me. I'd abandoned
everything I believed

418
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,370
to please a worthless man.

419
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,130
~ Surely if you told the police now...
~ No, M'Lady.

420
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,700
I won't bring it back to life. Leave
him be.

421
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,410
As it is, he'll never know a day's
happiness

422
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
for there is nothing good in him.

423
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,730
So what might you have done in York
that would place you there?

424
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,490
Now, let me think. I posted a letter
to an old army pal.

425
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,370
~ Would he still have it? ~ That I
couldn't tell you.

426
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,930
~ Anything else? ~ I made enquiries at a
shoe shop.

427
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,650
~ Do you recall which one? ~ Browns.
In Queen Street.

428
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,570
They were opening up. Then I had
a cup of coffee at the Royal York.

429
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,650
I went back there for a drink later
on before I caught the train home.

430
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,690
In the middle of the day?

431
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:37,420
I walked around. I had a sandwich at
lunchtime in some pub or other.

432
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Let me think.

433
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,660
Don't worry. I've got enough. Thank
you for your time.

434
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,290
No need to frown, Mrs Bates. Just
routine.

435
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,170
But why would Mr Green say such
things about Mr Bates?

436
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,010
Who knows? Anyway, everything seems
to be in order.

437
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,180
Good day to you.

438
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,500
I don't know why Mr Green would want
to make trouble for you.

439
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,410
Well, I never liked him so I suppose
he never liked me.

440
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,580
Yes, but to invent a quarrel then
tell the world about it.

441
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,490
It's as if he were expecting me to
make trouble first

442
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,930
and so he was covering himself in
case I did.

443
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
It does seem like that, doesn't it?

444
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,250
~ I have to get a mark out of His
Lordship's tails. ~ Go.

445
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,300
Of course. You go.

446
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,140
Every figure shows a different kind
of reverence.

447
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,610
Some eager, some contemplative.

448
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Some amazed.

449
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,690
Even the magpie seems to have been
struck dumb.

450
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,740
You're very sharp.

451
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,170
Umbria was full of magpies

452
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,610
so della Francesca chose a bird known
for its chatter

453
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
and made it silent in wonder.

454
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,410
How beautiful it is.

455
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,620
I think your picture may be a study
for this angel.

456
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,970
There are elements common to both.

457
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,010
It was painted at the end of his
life.

458
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,770
I envy him.

459
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,500
To be able to create something like
this when death was closing in.

460
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,810
I'd love to think I could still do
something

461
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,650
that people talk about more than
four centuries later.

462
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,250
You don't sound confident.

463
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,570
I doubt they'll remember anything
I've done by the time my
body's cold.

464
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,090
~ I'm sure that's not true. ~ You're not
but I like you for saying it.

465
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,140
Come and look at this one.

466
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,570
I'm afraid I'm taking up far too
much of your time.

467
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,860
Not true. I'm enjoying myself.

468
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
M'Lady.

469
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
M'Lady?!

470
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,660
Are you there?

471
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900
M'Lady?

472
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Wait here. Wait here.

473
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,970
I didn't know where you were.

474
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,370
Oh, you're back. She's been no
trouble at all.

475
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,650
She should have gone when Tim got
home, M'Lady.

476
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,490
~ I was enjoying myself. ~ That's very
kind, I'm sure.

477
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,780
Hey. Hello.

478
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:51,170
Well, I suppose I should be off.

479
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,850
Unless you'd like me to stay while
you settle Billy.

480
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,170
~ That's generous, M'Lady but there's
no need. ~ Good.

481
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,890
Right. I'll be off then.

482
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,940
~ Can I look in tomorrow?
~ You must be so busy.

483
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,380
Why don't I come and then you can
turn me out if you like.

484
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,690
Goodbye, darling.

485
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,020
~ Bye. ~ Bye.

486
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,530
Honestly, Tim!

487
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,850
She'll hear you. Let her get away.

488
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,410
I can't manage it much longer.

489
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,090
I'm sorry if she's lonely and
wants a child

490
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,610
~ but she can't have ours. ~ You're not
being reasonable.

491
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,650
Just now, I thought she'd taken her.

492
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,890
I did, truly. I wish we'd never
started it.

493
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,370
Think what she could do for the girl
if she's a mind to.

494
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,570
In 10 years or 15. Are we all to live
together in a threesome until then?

495
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,170
~ Is that what you want? ~ Me?

496
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,890
I thought she was soft on you
but it's the other way round.

497
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,340
You're the one who's soft. Soft in
the head!

498
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,290
She keeps being engaged. I wonder if
there's a fault on the line?

499
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,050
~ I'll send a telegram. ~ I don't know.
I probably should go back.

500
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,890
~ I'm in quite the wrong clothes for
dinner. ~ Please.

501
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,890
You said yourself she wouldn't mind.

502
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,370
As for your clothes, you'll be the
best-looking woman

503
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,730
~ in the Ritz dining room whatever
you're wearing. ~ Oh, golly.

504
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,770
~ That's cheered me up. ~ I mean it.

505
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,850
I so want to hear what you have to
say about it.

506
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,450
~ I can't think why. I don't know
anything. ~ Nonsense.

507
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,570
You have an instinct for the key
elements of every picture.

508
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,210
They speak to you. I envy that.

509
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,300
Well, I probably shouldn't but I
guess I will.

510
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,810
~ I won't stay out late, though.
~ Don't worry.

511
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,410
You'll be home and safe as the clock
strikes 12.

512
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,730
A lot sooner than that, please.

513
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,570
But surely if Bates convinced Willis
he was in York that day...

514
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,290
~ I only said it may not be over.
~ Why not?

515
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,090
The sergeant's a nice man but he's
not the brightest button in the box.

516
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,530
According to Mr Carson, Mr Bates
told the Sergeant

517
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,850
he visited a shoe shop as it was
opening.

518
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,330
The shoe shop is in Queen Street,
10 minutes walk from the station.

519
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,650
~ Oh. ~ He also had a cup of coffee at
the Royal York

520
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,490
which operates as a station hotel.

521
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,730
You mean he still had time to get to
London and back?

522
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,290
~ Do you think Carson registered any
of this? ~ I doubt it.

523
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,730
And he wouldn't give Mr Bates away
if he did.

524
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,330
But there's a danger that Sergeant
Willis or someone he talks to

525
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,810
~ may put two and two together. ~ They'd
still have to prove it.

526
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,890
Yes, they would still need proof.

527
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
Let's keep a hold of that.

528
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,730
I had such a nice evening.

529
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,780
~ Me too. ~ I love London.

530
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,650
Sometimes I forget how much but I
do.

531
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,530
I remember when I first arrived.

532
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,260
~ You don't want to hear about all
that. ~ But I do.

533
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,330
London scared me at first.

534
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,690
I'd only been in a school room a few
months before.

535
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,730
But my mother was eager.

536
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:51,210
Why especially?

537
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,170
We weren't really in the first rank
in Cincinnati.

538
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,220
Still less when we moved to New
York.

539
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,900
My father was Jewish and the money
was new.

540
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,730
But there was a lot of it and I was
pretty.

541
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,660
I suppose I can say that now I'm an
old lady.

542
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,010
She thought you'd make a better match
over the Atlantic.

543
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,450
And suddenly, here I was in these
vast ballrooms.

544
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,890
And all the other girls seemed
to know what to do and what to wear.

545
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,690
~ And how to flirt. ~ I bet you were
more beautiful than all of them.

546
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,900
More original. More real.

547
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,090
I certainly got a lot of
names on my dance card.

548
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,050
Listen to me bragging.

549
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,930
Please forgive me. I never talk
about myself.

550
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,890
~ Why did I say all that? ~ Because I'm
interested.

551
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,330
Well, it's time for me to stop.
We're nearly there.

552
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,210
Can't we pretend we're not? And walk
round the square again?

553
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:47,610
The truth is, I am quite
light-headed.

554
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,650
Going out for a night on the town.

555
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,380
Seems more my daughters' territory
than my own.

556
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
You can't know what a good time I
had.

557
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,010
Please may we do it again.

558
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,060
I doubt it.

559
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
But I hear the offer as a
compliment.

560
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,740
Rosamund.

561
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,220
I hope you got my cable.

562
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:25,050
~ But I've had such a... ~ Such a what?
~ ..nice time. Robert!

563
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,370
I didn't know you were coming up
to London. You never gave me a clue!

564
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,090
It was meant to be a surprise. I got
a table at Claridge's

565
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,490
~ so we could make a night of it.
~ I am sorry.

566
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,570
~ Shall we telephone? ~ Don't worry. I
cancelled everything

567
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,530
when we got Mr Bricker's telegram.

568
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,810
~ Where's Rosamund? ~ Upstairs. She gave
me your dinner and went to bed.

569
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,850
~ I'm dreadfully sorry. ~ So you said.

570
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,970
Wait a minute. I don't see I've done
anything to make you angry.

571
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,570
No? I travel to London in order to
give my wife a treat

572
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,170
only to find she's out dining with
another man.

573
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,970
Mr Bricker wanted to discuss the
paintings.

574
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,090
Rosamund said she needed an early
night.

575
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,170
Why was it so wrong to accept his
invitation?

576
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,210
Bricker was interested in discussing
the pictures with you?

577
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,650
Yes. Is that so difficult to
believe?

578
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,370
That an art expert would find your
observations on the work

579
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,410
of Piero della Francesca impossible
to resist? Yes.

580
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,330
~ It IS hard to believe. ~ I'm going to
bed.

581
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,250
~ Cora. ~ It's quite all right.

582
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,580
You've said what you think
and you've every right to do so.

583
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,610
Tell me, does Edith seem very
distracted to you?

584
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,610
~ I'm not sure I'd notice. ~ Well, she
does to me.

585
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:44,490
As if she were always thinking about
something else.

586
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,460
~ I might say the same of you. ~ It can
be hard to know what to do
for the best.

587
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,890
You don't want to hurt people but
you may have to.

588
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,090
I know what you mean.

589
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,500
Sorry. That just slipped out.

590
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,940
~ Are you talking about Tony?
~ Maybe.

591
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,220
I don't know. I'm not sure.

592
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:08,220
~ I was beginning to think you'd
settled on him. ~ I had. I think.

593
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
But now, I seem to have unsettled.

594
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,740
Goodness! I haven't said it out loud
before.

595
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,290
~ So, what's he done wrong? ~ Nothing.

596
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,450
We'd never spent much time together
until recently.

597
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,490
And when we did, I began to wonder
how much we really had in common.

598
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,020
How recent was this time you spent
together?

599
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
VERY recent.

600
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,170
Are we talking about your so-called
sketching trip?

601
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,330
Because I never believed in that for
a moment.

602
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,500
The point is, I wasn't seeing him
clearly but now I do...

603
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,010
He's a nice man. A very nice man.

604
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
But not...

605
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,330
I mean, of course, we talked about
things.

606
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,090
But I think my judgement was rather
clouded by...

607
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,420
By what Miss Elinor Glyn likes to
write about in her novels.

608
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,090
Maybe.

609
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,130
But I seem to have got over that now.

610
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,570
Well, I won't ask how.

611
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
Please don't.

612
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,370
Well, I'll back you up if you
support me.

613
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,330
Are we talking about Miss Bunting or
your move to America?

614
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,210
I'm not sure. Either or both.

615
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:22,210
Well, you're asking a lot. I'm not
very keen on Miss Bunting

616
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,050
and I can't bear the thought of your
leaving.

617
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,300
Well, if you love me, you'll support
me.

618
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
Then I suppose I'll have to.

619
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,410
I was wondering about Rose's Russian
tea. Shall we go together?

620
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,370
~ Well, when is it?
~ This afternoon.

621
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,370
Oh, good heavens. I'd forgotten all
about it.

622
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,410
~ Well, I'm not sure I'll have the
energy. ~ You must come.

623
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,170
You've been to Russia. None of us
have.

624
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,970
~ Did you get to know any when you
were there? ~ Oh, yes.

625
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,010
Oh, yes.

626
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,570
~ Did you keep up with them?
~ Oh, I'm afraid not.

627
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,770
An unlucky friend is tiresome enough.

628
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,130
An unlucky acquaintance is
intolerable.

629
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,700
You're all heart (!)

630
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,210
~ We're back. ~ Phew. I was terrified you
were going to miss it.

631
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,490
No, not likely. By the way, before I
left, I asked Pattinson

632
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,650
to look out the Russian things from
my father's visit. Did it happen?

633
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,570
Oh, it did. And they'll be so
thrilled.

634
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,450
If we're going to do it, we might as
well do it properly.

635
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,530
~ Don't you agree, Mrs Patmore?
~ Yes, M'Lord.

636
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,410
~ What's the matter with her? ~ Nothing
for you to worry about.

637
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,130
~ I'm not but what is it? ~ Something
beneath your Lordship's notice.

638
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,490
~ She'll get over it.
~ There's not nearly enough lemon.

639
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,490
~ Well, shall I go down and tell them?
~ No, I'll do it.

640
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Tony, I don't believe it.

641
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,730
~ What's going on? ~ Don't ask. Rose
wanted to invite Russians for tea.

642
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,530
And it's turned into a Jubilee
celebration.

643
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,530
~ How was London? ~ How is it always?
Large and noisy.

644
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,090
Lady Grantham. Isobel.

645
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,810
~ Well, I wanted to see you. ~ You've
spent a day in a car for that. ~ Yes.

646
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,810
I didn't want to nag you over
the telephone when if I drove up

647
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,970
~ we could make our plans together.
~ Good afternoon, my dear.

648
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,090
Granny. Now, Granny, there's
something I'd love to show you.

649
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,330
Hello, Lord Gillingham. It's
very nice of you to come for this.

650
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,890
~ I came to see Mary, really.
~ Of course you did.

651
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,650
~ And so you should.
~ You were always very kind to me.

652
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,050
Mrs Crawley. Thank you.

653
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,460
~ I don't think I am. ~ Yes, you are.
I appreciate it.

654
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,730
~ I'm sorry to add to your labours.
~ Don't worry, M'Lady.

655
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,730
I'll have them sliced in no time.

656
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,210
~ Daisy, are you ready? ~ Daisy's busy
I'm afraid. ~ I've got too much on.

657
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,530
~ Why? What's happening? ~ There's a big
tea for the Russian refugees.

658
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,300
~ Your displaced Tsarist aristos. ~ You
could always stay if you like.

659
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
Lots to eat.

660
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,770
I hope his arrival means you intend
to make it public.

661
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,290
Darling, granny, you know how much I
value your advice...

662
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,730
Which means you intend to ignore it.

663
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,370
I won't be hurried into anything.
Not by you or him.

664
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,810
But if you weren't certain, why on
earth did you go to bed with him?

665
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,850
Well, in my day...

666
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,810
a lady was incapable of feeling
physical attraction

667
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,010
until she had been instructed to do
so by her mama.

668
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,050
I don't believe that.

669
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,700
Seriously, my dear, you have to take
control of your feelings...

670
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,260
..before they take control of you.

671
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,490
Baxter...

672
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,770
~ M'Lady. ~ ..I thought a lot about what
you told me yesterday.

673
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,730
And I still think you should report
Mr Coyle.

674
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,050
I won't, M'Lady. And if that makes a
difference...

675
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,580
It won't. You may stay.

676
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Thank you.

677
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Thank you so much.

678
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,570
Have you seen what we've dug out for
the Ruskies?

679
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,090
Well, I say, 'we', it was Pattinson
who did it.

680
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,850
Does it matter? You place no value
on my opinions.

681
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:27,250
Cora, I was cross. I had travelled
the length of England

682
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,570
to spend the evening with you and
you had gone out.

683
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,730
~ Aren't I allowed to be cross? ~ Cross
but not unjust.

684
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,100
Would you excuse me? I think they're
here.

685
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,530
M'Lady. Mr Drewe is at the back door
downstairs.

686
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,100
~ He's asking for you. Should I ask
him to come up? ~ No, I'll go down.

687
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,810
~ They told me you were here. ~ I didn't
know you were entertaining.

688
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,050
It doesn't matter. What is it?
Tell me there's nothing wrong.

689
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,490
~ Please. ~ There's nothing wrong with
Marigold.

690
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,290
~ Thank God. ~ No. What's wrong is
Margie.

691
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,810
~ I know I've annoyed her. ~ I'm afraid
you must stay away, M'Lady.

692
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,610
That's all. Not forever.

693
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,660
But for now, you must stay away.

694
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,330
M'Lady.

695
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,890
~ You have Russian connections, Miss
Bunting? ~ No.

696
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,770
~ I'm here under false pretences.
~ Nonsense. You're welcome.

697
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,410
~ What is THAT woman doing here?
~ Rose found her in the kitchen

698
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,530
~ and asked her to join us. ~ Why?
~ Don't be silly. She had to.

699
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,570
Why do you let her irritate you so?

700
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,810
How dare you say such things to me?!

701
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,370
~ I don't think she meant any... ~ She
curses the name of our Holy Father.

702
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,810
~ The Tsar. ~ I said he was misguided in
his policies.

703
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,850
No. No. I can't listen to this!

704
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,810
Lady Rose, would you please arrange
for us to return to York
immediately.

705
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:07,170
Oh, but before you go, won't you
come and see the mementoes

706
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,090
of the wedding of Tsar Alexander
II's daughter?

707
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,690
Lord Grantham had them put out
especially for you to see.

708
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,850
You have Romanov's relics here?

709
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,530
My parents went to St Petersburg in
1874.

710
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,570
When Queen Victoria's son, Prince
Alfred,

711
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,570
~ married the Grand Duchess Maria.
~ Grand Duchess Maria.

712
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:29,050
Those words... They already make...

713
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,570
~ me weep. ~ Oh, dear.

714
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,610
Oh, we can't have that.

715
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,170
Thank you.

716
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,210
Now do you see why she irritates me?

717
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,300
~ Tom, keep her under control.
~ She only wants...

718
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,850
I feel rather guilty. I thought
they'd enjoy the things we found.

719
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,970
Oh, dear, no. They ARE enjoying them.

720
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,130
What were you doing in Russia?

721
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,570
Lord Grantham was in the household
of Prince Alfred.

722
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,730
And we went to St Petersburg for
their wedding.

723
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,050
~ I suppose it was very splendid.
~ Oh, you've no idea.

724
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,490
Receptions and balls. Glittering
parades.

725
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,100
Rides in a horse-drawn sleigh.
Flying across the snow at midnight.

726
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,220
Excuse me. Make way. Make way.

727
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,370
Oh. Oh, how funny.

728
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,730
I wondered what had happened to that
fan.

729
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,370
~ That wasn't given to your father. It
was given to me. ~ Who by? The Tsar?

730
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,890
No. No. Not by the Tsar. No.

731
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,930
No, we were at a ball.

732
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,050
In the Winter Palace. And it was
so...

733
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,450
Oh, it was so hot. There were
icicles hanging outside the window.

734
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,810
But the rooms were as hot as the
tropics.

735
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,410
I was wearing pale blue velvet.

736
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,450
Trimmed with silver lace.

737
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,490
And when I gave you this fan you hid
it in your reticule

738
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,700
in case Lord Grantham should be
angry.

739
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,290
Good heavens.

740
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,530
I hope you can forgive me.

741
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,610
When I knew the others are coming, I
could not resist the temptation.

742
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,890
This is amazing. You know each other.

743
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,930
You met in St Petersburg?

744
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,940
We did.

745
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,050
Allow me...

746
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,300
to present my son, Lord Grantham.

747
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Prince Kuragin.

748
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,930
I am flattered to be remembered.

749
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,460
How is the princess? Well, I hope.

750
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,180
I don't know.

751
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,890
Why don't we go back to the hall and
have some more tea?

752
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,660
Yes. Thank you.

753
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,140
Thank you.

754
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,530
Granny has a past.

755
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,450
Thank heavens Papa and Aunt Rosamund
were already born

756
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,980
or we could spin all sorts of fairy
tales.

757
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,490
~ How's it going? ~ There seems to be a
good deal of emotion being vented

758
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:07,420
among the guests in the library but
then they are foreigners.

759
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,580
Right. Now, I must get on.

760
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,570
Stop giving me such knowing looks.

761
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,650
I met the prince when I was
travelling with your grandfather.

762
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,770
~ Nothing could be more respectable.
~ Whatever you say.

763
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,570
Away with your impertinent
conclusions!

764
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,610
My only conclusion is this -

765
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,220
I know you understand my predicament
far better than you let on.

766
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,740
Have you made plans to see your
admirer again?

767
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
Drive on.

768
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,810
I'm studying the Glorious Revolution
of 1688.

769
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,370
They'll be a glorious revolution
here if you don't watch!

770
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,810
~ I do hope this won't be something
you'll regret. ~ I won't.

771
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,330
~ You only say that to sound clever.
~ I know. You should try it.

772
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,410
Good heavens. There's Charles Blake.

773
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,010
I think you know Lady Mary Crawley.
Miss Lane Fox.

774
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,330
~ We don't know each other exactly.
~ We know OF each other.

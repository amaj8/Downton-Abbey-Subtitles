2
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,814
Oh, Mr Barrow, you're back.

3
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:56,552
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon,
but you're in time to help upstairs.

4
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:59,729
Maybe there's something left.
Don't bother. I'm not hungry.

5
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,662
Charming as ever!
How's your father doing?

6
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:06,147
Oh, much better, as it happens. In
fact, he's quite well again.

7
00:01:06,162 --> 00:01:08,233
That's good news.
Yes. It is.

8
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,915
You remember we're meeting Mr Wavell
at three? Pip's Corner.

9
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,958
Yes, but I don't see the point in
it, since I'm not going to agree.

10
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:19,268
He's driven all the way from Leeds.

11
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:22,778
I had a letter from your father.
He says he's in London for a visit.

12
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:25,680
Shrimpie's in England?
Have you made any plans to see him?

13
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:28,988
Not yet. He wonders if you might let
him stay here.

14
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:30,938
Of course, whenever he wants.

15
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,029
Is Susan with him?
No.

16
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:36,091
Their time's up soon and she
couldn't face another voyage.

17
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:38,886
Where will they send him, do you
think? After Bombay.

18
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,949
How are your Russians getting on?

19
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,039
Oh, it's so sad.

20
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,149
They talk about the old days -
dances at the Winter Palace,
picnics on the banks of the Neva -

21
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,744
but there are holes in their shoes,
and they've got no money for food.

22
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:57,270
This is where Tom says it serves them
right.

23
00:01:57,286 --> 00:02:00,150
Well, I don't approve of how things
were managed in Russia,

24
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,844
but I'm still sorry for people who have
to make a new life in a foreign land.

25
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:07,851
Honestly, Papa, every time you challenge
Tom, you sound much more
unreasonable than he is.

26
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:09,517
Do I?

27
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,656
How's your old beau managing, Mama?
Prince Thingummyjig.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,714
He is not my old beau.

29
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:19,105
Your father would have called out
any man who said such a thing.

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,203
Even so, I do hope you see him
again. Poor old boy.

31
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,241
You don't know anything about it.

32
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:30,905
How far would the houses stretch?

33
00:02:30,906 --> 00:02:32,853
Well, the whole field, really.

34
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:37,043
But why can't they be built in a
row, like the other streets?

35
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:41,596
They'd sell more quickly as
separate dwellings, and we'd
get a percentage of the sales.

36
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:44,878
So, we're paid once, and in return
the field is lost,

37
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:49,153
the village is spoiled and Mr Wavell
moves on in search of his next victim.

38
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:00,721
Why didn't you tell them we were
coming here today?

39
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,445
Oh... They'll find out as soon as
Rose gets home.

40
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:06,757
I didn't want to be a 'topic' for
the rest of luncheon.

41
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,694
But what are we here for'?

42
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:11,721
Well, somethings been troubling me.

43
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:15,666
Oh, why on earth didn't we get a
taxi from the station?

44
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,536
We must be mad.

45
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:20,179
Well, we'll get a taxi home - that's
for sure.

46
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,116
It's saying it's in the crypt.

47
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,509
Oh, Isobel, I didn't think it would
be like this.

48
00:03:31,526 --> 00:03:33,346
No, neither did I.

49
00:03:44,852 --> 00:03:48,652
Aunt Violet? Mrs Crawley?
You never said you were coming.

50
00:03:48,654 --> 00:03:50,509
We wanted to surprise you.

51
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:53,454
Well, you've succeeded.

52
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,295
Ah, there he is.

53
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:01,783
I must be the last person you
expected to see.

54
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,726
No. I thought you would come.

55
00:04:06,026 --> 00:04:08,734
I've brought my cousin, Mrs Crawley.

56
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:12,119
Do you remember Rostov?

57
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:14,103
Count Rostov, I think.

58
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,928
Thank you. Yes. Please, ladies.
Please.

59
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:25,812
I'm sorry I didn't say very much...

60
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:27,645
Thank you... at Downton.

61
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,372
But I was... I was so surprised.

62
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:35,576
You haven't changed. I have.

63
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:37,348
It's true.

64
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:41,432
Then, you were the young and
beautiful Countess of Grantham,

65
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,434
turning eyes in a ballroom or out in
your carriage.

66
00:04:46,454 --> 00:04:51,528
Now you are the great lady -
imperious, magnificent.

67
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:55,515
But these are two sides of the same
coin.

68
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:59,089
Your life has not much altered in
half a century.

69
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:01,631
It doesn't seem so to me.

70
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:06,331
Whereas the handsome and powerful
Prince Kuragin,

71
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:10,335
with his thousands of acres and his
golden palaces...

72
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,127
That man does not exist. Not any
more.

73
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:21,268
Ah, Mr Molesley. I've put out some
silver to be cleaned.

74
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,322
I'd be grateful if you could see to
it.

75
00:05:23,352 --> 00:05:26,276
Very good, Mr Carson.
I was looking for Mr Barrow.

76
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,030
He's gone out.
Precisely.

77
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:30,967
But then I thought: No.
This is down to Mr Molesley.

78
00:05:30,975 --> 00:05:33,057
After all, he is the First Footman.

79
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,744
Oh...

80
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:48,883
I have thought a good deal about
what you said the other day,

81
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,630
when I asked after the Princess.

82
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,337
That I don't know how or where she
is?

83
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:56,306
It's true.

84
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,899
We were arrested together,

85
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:06,682
and when I came out of prison, I heard
she'd been exiled a year earlier.

86
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:09,879
There must be someone in authority
who - Who?

87
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,455
The Soviet Ambassador.

88
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:17,405
Do you think he cares where Princess
Irina Kuragin is presently lodged?

89
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,607
Well, what about the Foreign Office?

90
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:22,954
Do they help the losing side in any
revolution? No.

91
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,916
You mustn't give up hope.

92
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,746
When you go through a storm like
ours,

93
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:31,251
you give up hope quite early on in
the proceedings.

94
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:38,269
I agree. Hope is a tease, designed
to prevent us accepting reality.

95
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:40,424
Oh, you only say that to sound
clever.

96
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:42,396
I know.

97
00:06:42,437 --> 00:06:44,371
You should try it.

98
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,061
I want to call on the blacksmith.
I'll see you back at the house.

99
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,294
Mrs Patmore?

100
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:03,137
Oh, good afternoon, m'lord. M'lady.

101
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:07,412
I wish I knew what that was about.

102
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,443
And why the funny look when I asked
after Shrimpie at luncheon?

103
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:15,139
I suspect he's come to tell Rose
they're getting a divorce.

104
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:18,128
Are you serious?
I'm afraid so.

105
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,222
He's hinted at it in his letters,
apparently,

106
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,237
and I gather things have not been
improving.

107
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,000
That's the end of his career.

108
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:26,412
Well, the Martboroughs have survived
divorce.

109
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:30,650
Well, the Martboroughs are very
rich. Shrimpie hasn't got a bean.

110
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,853
People will drop them like hot
potatoes.

111
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,661
Will we drop Shrimpie?
Susan's your cousin, not him.

112
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,949
No, I won't take sides, whatever
Susan wants.

113
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,093
Would you give me a hand with these?

114
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,706
When are you leaving? Lady Mary
wants to get the eight o'clock.

115
00:07:55,707 --> 00:07:59,158
She's going to a dress show with
Lady Rosamund in the afternoon.

116
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,119
I'll miss you.
So I should hope.

117
00:08:03,654 --> 00:08:06,840
Are you all right? I hope you
haven't let the sergeant worry you.

118
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,806
No, he doesn't worry me.

119
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:12,916
I just wish we could all forget
about Mr Green.

120
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:20,603
Why did you want me to go with you
today?

121
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:26,337
Oh, it was just in case things
turned mawkish.

122
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:30,935
I prevent Lord Merton saying
anything to embarrass you -

123
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:33,145
I wanted the same protection myself.

124
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,269
I presume you and Prince Kuragin
were once... attracted to each other.

125
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,344
'Attracted to each other'?
Is that what you call it?

126
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:47,751
As it happens, he asked me to run
away with him.

127
00:08:47,752 --> 00:08:52,656
But you didn't go. No, Lord Grantham
gave me a frame by Faberge,

128
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,265
with two pictures of the children in
it, and I saw sense.

129
00:08:57,283 --> 00:09:00,127
Lord Grantham sounds rather more
subtle than I'd realised.

130
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:02,612
Well, like all Englishmen of his
type.

131
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:07,112
He hid his qualities beneath a thick
blanket of convention,

132
00:09:07,124 --> 00:09:10,847
so I didn't see who he really was at
first.

133
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,737
It was lucky you found out in time.

134
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:15,607
If it was in time.

135
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,994
I forget.

136
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:23,339
Daisy! Will you put those bally
books away and come and help?

137
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:25,240
And where are the pastry casings?

138
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,818
I'll make them now.
You should have made them before!

139
00:09:27,826 --> 00:09:31,421
What is all that? I'm studying the
Glorious Revolution of 1688.

140
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:35,041
Well, there'll be a glorious revolution
down here, if you don't watch it!

141
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,927
Did you hear that in there?

142
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:40,938
I mean, mathematics is one thing. She's
studying to be a revolutionary now!

143
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:45,028
I hope there's no cooking going on
up in your room.

144
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:48,469
I should find out what he's up to.
I'm sure it's nothing.

145
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:12,865
Lord Merton?

146
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:15,892
Oh! I er... Well, that is...

147
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,711
You're here.

148
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,102
Well, hadn't you better come in?
Thank you.

149
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,224
Well, how can I help?

150
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:39,127
I nearly flunked it,

151
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,635
but I've put it off so many times,

152
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:45,159
and as I was sitting all alone at
luncheon today, I just thought:

153
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,898
'No. I'm jolly well going over there
to say it.'

154
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,508
I do hope this won't be something
you'll regret.

155
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:52,346
You may regret it. I won't.

156
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:59,335
Very well. I'm listening.

157
00:11:01,232 --> 00:11:04,930
I really should go down on one knee,
but I fear I'd never get up again.

158
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:11,573
I'm sure you realise by now - I'm
asking for your hand in marriage.

159
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:14,737
Dear Lord Merton, you see -

160
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,828
Please. Please.

161
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,510
I want to be quite dear.

162
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:26,130
I'm not speaking out of loneliness
or with a view to my comfort.

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,258
I'm sure -
No, you're not.

164
00:11:30,936 --> 00:11:34,744
When men of my age marry, that's
usually the reason.

165
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,461
But my proposal is a romantic one.

166
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:41,148
I state freely and proudly, Isobel,
that I have fallen in love with you.

167
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,198
And I want to spend what remains of
my life in your company.

168
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,590
I believe I could make you happy.

169
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,623
At any rate, I... I should very much
like the chance to try.

170
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,779
Well, goodness, Lord Merton...

171
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:01,249
I freely admit you have taken me by
surprise.

172
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:07,703
Not with your proposal, but with
your... talk of love.

173
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,861
I mean it.

174
00:12:12,056 --> 00:12:13,922
And before you refuse me...

175
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:18,614
...I'd like to ask you to leave it on
the table, so to speak.

176
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:20,747
Say nothing for the time being.

177
00:12:20,748 --> 00:12:23,312
Just think about it.

178
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:26,164
I'm not sure it would change my
answer,

179
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:28,792
but after such eloquence,

180
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:31,961
to refuse your request would seem
ungenerous.

181
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,127
I will think about it.

182
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,467
Well...

183
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,358
Now I think I'll take my leave.

184
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:47,796
I suspect ordinary conversation
would be difficult after that.

185
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,579
What do you mean, that man Bricker
is coming back? Why?

186
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:03,842
'That man Bricker'? What has he done
to deserve such a welcome?

187
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,920
Hasn't he seen what he came to see?

188
00:13:05,944 --> 00:13:10,381
He wants to investigate a possible
link between our picture and a later
work by Della Francesca.

189
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,127
Shrimpie is coming this week.

190
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,381
Well, then, he and Mr Bricker will
get to know each other, won't they?

191
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,656
Edith, darling, why so glum?

192
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:21,726
I'm not glum, am I?

193
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,797
How's your prodigy child?

194
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,867
I haven't seen her for a while.

195
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:30,135
I was getting rather under their feet,
so I thought I'd give them a rest.

196
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,540
I knew that would happen.

197
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:34,849
Why don't you leave it for a few
months?

198
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,588
A few months?
I should.

199
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:39,329
Then they'll be pleased to see you
when you do go back.

200
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,206
Any thoughts on Pip's Corner?

201
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:43,347
I'd love to understand the merits of
the argument.

202
00:13:43,362 --> 00:13:45,103
You want us to do it, don't you?

203
00:13:45,121 --> 00:13:48,068
Well, it's capital with no outlay.
We have to consider it.

204
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:50,693
Consider it, yes. But it's complex.

205
00:13:50,694 --> 00:13:54,517
Do we really want to start breaking bits
off the estate and selling them piecemeal?

206
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:57,131
You wanted to sell land when Matthew
died.

207
00:13:57,143 --> 00:14:00,528
And I was wrong. I didn't see how many
owners would chip away at their land

208
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:02,479
until there was nothing viable left.

209
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:04,341
Anyway, we can talk about it
tomorrow.

210
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,823
Not me.
I'm going up to London first thing.

211
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,148
Aunt Rosamund's taking me to a dress
show.

212
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:12,064
It's good to know you've got your
priorities straight.

213
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:23,098
Hello? Who's in there?

214
00:14:24,986 --> 00:14:27,489
Please, let me know who's in there.

215
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,444
Go away.

216
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,400
Mr Barrow?

217
00:14:31,414 --> 00:14:34,008
Would you like me to fetch a man to
help you?

218
00:14:36,784 --> 00:14:38,695
Mr Barrow...

219
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,449
What man?

220
00:14:41,454 --> 00:14:44,162
There isn't a man in
this house who'd help me.

221
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,562
What's the matter with you?

222
00:14:49,076 --> 00:14:50,953
Just mind your own business!

223
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:00,549
Now, you're sure there's no big
evening event?

224
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:02,955
No, and we're only there one night.

225
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:05,815
When are you seeing His Lordship?
Friday morning.

226
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,640
Before we catch the train home.

227
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,846
It's right to do it face to face.

228
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,802
But of course I'm dreading it.

229
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:26,971
Daddy!
Hello, Sybbie, my love. Kiss.

230
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,791
Thank you, Nanny. Morning, George.

231
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:33,231
Morning, Donk.

232
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,168
Morning, Sybbie. Morning, George.

233
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,436
Do we think Lady Mary made the
train? She was cutting it fine.

234
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,963
Mr Stark saw them both on board.

235
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,932
Carson, may I ask you something?

236
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:47,073
Is Mrs Patmore quite happy?

237
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:51,279
I'm afraid there is a particular
matter that has upset her, m'lord.

238
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,114
May I know what it is?

239
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,240
But why make him wait?

240
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,430
You mean I must refuse him now?

241
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:02,169
Well, you said yourself the whole
idea was ridiculous.

242
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:07,280
Yes, but I can only tell you, when it
came to it, he was not... ridiculous.

243
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,248
You surprise me.

244
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:13,492
One kind word and your judgment
takes flight.

245
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:17,115
Surely Prince Kuragin has reminded
you what one kind word can do.

246
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:21,485
He's asked me to think about it.

247
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:24,765
And I will think about it.

248
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:31,873
It was Michael's office on the telephone
- there's been a development.

249
00:16:33,255 --> 00:16:36,134
Apparently, there's a trial going on
in Munich.

250
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,963
Of the leader of a group of thugs
there.

251
00:16:39,986 --> 00:16:43,900
I've read about this. They wear brown
shirts and go around bullying people.

252
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,766
The leader tried to start a
revolution.

253
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,923
That's it. It was absurd.

254
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,838
Maybe. But I'm afraid we're going to
see a lot more of this sort of thing.

255
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:55,021
We pushed Germany too hard with our
demands after the war.

256
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,473
It seems it was this gang that got
into a fight with Michael.

257
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,982
I can easily believe it. They're a
horrid bunch, from the sound of it.

258
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:06,135
Yes, but we might be dose to
finding out what happened to him.

259
00:17:06,933 --> 00:17:08,879
That's why his office telephoned?

260
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:17,166
It will be very hard for you, my
darling,

261
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:21,880
but I promise it's better to know the
truth

262
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:24,821
than to live in a cloud of mystery
and despair.

263
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:29,507
But as long as I don't know for sure,
then, in a way, I'm keeping him alive.

264
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:32,685
I hate to let go of that.

265
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:37,600
Can you keep this to yourself, Papa?

266
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:39,460
Until we're told for certain.

267
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,367
I don't want to put up with Mary's
pity any longer than I have to.

268
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:48,175
She will pity you, and God knows, so
do I.

269
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,481
I'm fearfully late.

270
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,786
Where are my gloves?
Don't worry.

271
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:01,055
It will all be unpacked before you
get back.

272
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:03,360
You're a dream. I must run.

273
00:18:03,902 --> 00:18:07,634
Oh, wait a minute.
Could you post this?

274
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:11,024
Or give it to Mead if he hasn't
emptied the box in the hall.

275
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:15,169
I never said where to meet me,
and Kensington Gardens
would be nice and neutral.

276
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,240
I thought about dining with him
tonight,

277
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,848
but midday seemed more appropriate
for bad news.

278
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:21,699
Very good, m'lady.

279
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,442
And how is Edith getting on?

280
00:18:43,454 --> 00:18:47,061
Actually, she's rather gloomy at the
moment. Do we know why?

281
00:18:47,065 --> 00:18:50,205
She's taken an interest in a child
of one of the tenants,

282
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,408
and now the parents are sick of her.

283
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,010
And why this child in particular?

284
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,184
I don't know.
She took a fancy to it.

285
00:18:57,196 --> 00:18:59,585
Now she seems to have overplayed her
hand.

286
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,580
Golly. That'd be useful.

287
00:19:02,581 --> 00:19:05,528
So, tell me more about this farmer
and his little girl.

288
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,149
How did you know it was a girl?
Well, you must have said.

289
00:19:08,644 --> 00:19:10,954
He looks after the pigs.

290
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,811
Oh, yummy.

291
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,518
Good heavens. There's Charles Blake.

292
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,351
What's he doing here?

293
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:59,664
Excuse me. Is this right for Lord
Gillingham?

294
00:19:59,678 --> 00:20:01,957
That doorway. First floor.

295
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,926
Thank you.

296
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,082
Hello.

297
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:31,147
Nice to see you.
Are you shopping for your trousseau?

298
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:32,591
Ha-ha.

299
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:35,722
Oh, I think you know Lady Mary
Crawley. Miss Lane Fox.

300
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,835
Oops.

301
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,998
I've suddenly remembered the
significance.

302
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:41,769
Try not to be an ass, Charles.

303
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,727
Well, we don't know each other,
exactly.

304
00:20:43,737 --> 00:20:46,331
But we certainly know OF each other.
Don't we?

305
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:49,828
It's not often you meet the woman
you were jilted for. Well, I -

306
00:20:49,841 --> 00:20:53,118
Don't worry. I wouldn't want a man
who preferred someone else.

307
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,024
You're quite over him, then?
Absolutely.

308
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,236
Now I must go.
I'm meeting Ralph Kerr later.

309
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:00,292
He's very tetchy if he's kept
waiting.

310
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:05,548
I thought you knew each other.
No.

311
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:08,303
And I must say, she wasn't at all
what I imagined.

312
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:09,917
What was that?

313
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:13,219
I don't know.
Someone meeker and more virtuous.

314
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,042
I don't think Mabel's very meek.
No. Obviously not.

315
00:21:17,338 --> 00:21:20,421
How long are you in London?
I go home tomorrow.

316
00:21:20,451 --> 00:21:23,250
I'll see Tony in the morning and
then catch the train.

317
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,210
Why? What are you doing tonight?
Nothing.

318
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,937
Then why not have dinner with me?
Don't you have plans?

319
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,763
None that I want to honour.
I'll come for you at eight.

320
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,803
Nowhere too swanky.
I haven't brought the right clothes.

321
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:09,332
I'll do them! Mrs Patmore, His
Lordship is asking for you.

322
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,077
Come up to the library, please.

323
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:14,212
Oh, my heaven! What, now? Oh, Lord!

324
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,537
You look fine. Give me your apron.

325
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:20,684
Ah, Mr Molesley. Just the man. Can you
cast your eye over the dining table?

326
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:23,748
I won't have time before dinner, and
you're the First Footman.

327
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,715
I was just going to -
While you're up there,

328
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:28,452
check the bedrooms for Lord
Flintshire and Mr Bricker.

329
00:22:28,453 --> 00:22:31,943
I haven't got a moment and, as Mr
Carson says, you are the First Footman.

330
00:22:31,944 --> 00:22:33,900
Right. I'm ready.

331
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,427
Go on, then, Mr Molesley.
It doesn't seem quite fair.

332
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,159
You wanted to be First Footman.
What did you think?

333
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,218
That you'd spend all day with your
feet up?

334
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:56,530
I thought I'd pop in and see how
Marigold's getting on.

335
00:22:57,473 --> 00:23:00,329
I'm afraid I'm just taking her up
for a rest, m'lady.

336
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:03,826
They've been playing outside and
she's tired.

337
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:06,768
Does she have to go up right away?
I think so, yes, m'lady.

338
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:17,326
M'lady?

339
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:26,411
The... the trouble is, Margie thinks
you're unsettling the child.

340
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:37,105
There are laws that govern the whole
business of war memorials.

341
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:39,535
So Mr Carson's told me, m'lord.

342
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,471
I appreciate how distressing this is
for you and your family.

343
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,339
Do you, m'lord?

344
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,737
Because I'm not sure Mr Carson does.

345
00:23:46,751 --> 00:23:49,675
Carson is as sorry about it as I am.
Aren't you, Carson?

346
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:53,936
I'm sorry that Mrs Patmore should be
distressed, m'lord.

347
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:57,644
But you're not sorry Archie's name's
to be left off the memorial.

348
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:01,459
He volunteered.
He didn't wait to be called up.

349
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:06,468
He went to the Front to fight, and
as for his so-called cowardice...

350
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,991
that were like a wound in battle, a
wound to his brain,

351
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:13,912
so he didn't know what he was doing.

352
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,882
He were a good and decent lad.

353
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:19,370
Of course he was. But doesn't that
make him a casualty of war, m'lord?

354
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:21,362
Same as our William or any of them.

355
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:26,261
He could have stayed here, safe and
well, until they came for him.

356
00:24:26,304 --> 00:24:30,070
But instead, he chose to
fight for his country.

357
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:33,907
It may surprise you to learn, Mrs
Patmore, but I agree with you,

358
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:36,110
even though I can do nothing about
it.

359
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:38,373
It's not helpful, but I do.

360
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,266
No, it is helpful.

361
00:24:40,297 --> 00:24:44,279
It helps to think that decent folk
can see our Archie was a victim.

362
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:46,905
Even if Mr Carson can't.

363
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:51,609
Thank you, Carson.

364
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:56,711
When does Shrimpie get here?
And your ghastly art dealer.

365
00:24:57,689 --> 00:25:01,523
They're on the same train and
the car's meeting them, so they'll
have time to change.

366
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,612
And he isn't a dealer. He's a
historian.

367
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:05,900
Is he, indeed? Lawks a-mercy.

368
00:25:06,984 --> 00:25:09,612
I wish I knew why he was coming.

369
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:12,009
He wants to discuss the painting.
With you?

370
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:13,962
Yes. Is that so shocking?

371
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,025
I'd better get on.

372
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:24,928
Oh, Mr Molesley. I've not been told

373
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:28,217
whether Lord Flintshire and Mr
Bricker will be bringing valets.

374
00:25:28,222 --> 00:25:30,852
Could you see they're properly
attended?

375
00:25:30,853 --> 00:25:32,981
Well, I've got a lot on my plate, Mr
Carson.

376
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:35,396
I am sorry, Mr Molesley,
but you are -

377
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,467
Yes, I know. I know. I'm the First
Footman.

378
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:43,572
50, you're happy?

379
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:48,614
Well, I'm not delirious, but who is?
I have a pretty good life.

380
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:50,453
Well, I'm glad.

381
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,023
I was never the type to die of a
broken heart, you know.

382
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:58,426
I'm sorry if that offends you.

383
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:02,148
On the contrary. I only hope Tony
feels the same.

384
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:06,274
Goodness. I wasn't expecting that.

385
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:14,020
I wish I could work you out.

386
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:15,994
I wish I could work me out.

387
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,029
When will you tell him?
Tomorrow.

388
00:26:21,886 --> 00:26:23,763
I'm meeting him at noon.

389
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:26,849
By the Peter Pan statue in
Kensington Gardens.

390
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,017
Won't that make him dream of happy
families?

391
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:30,869
Well, it's too late to change it
now.

392
00:26:31,497 --> 00:26:33,238
What's he done wrong?

393
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:35,214
Nothing.

394
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,110
I'm very fond of him.
I'll always be fond of him.

395
00:26:40,157 --> 00:26:44,185
I want him to be the godfather of my
children. Just not their father.

396
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:48,447
How will he take it?
Not as well as you.

397
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:56,744
Well, you've got a way to soften the
blow. If you want to.

398
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't see how.
Don't you?

399
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,468
You seem a little subdued tonight.
Do I, Granny?

400
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:08,963
How strange. I wonder why.

401
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:13,820
I know it sounds hard, but you must
learn to leave things behind.

402
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,852
I suppose you mean I'm to leave
Michael behind now,

403
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:20,018
as you've already made it quite
clear I'm to leave the baby behind.

404
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,940
I would never suggest anything that
is not in your interest.

405
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,854
In my interest? Or the family's?

406
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,313
To me, they are the same.

407
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,134
And that is where we differ.

408
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:36,743
I've been thinking about your
missing person.

409
00:27:36,744 --> 00:27:39,341
Oh, I don't want to be a nuisance,

410
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:44,061
but aren't there departments devoted
to finding people who are lost?

411
00:27:44,062 --> 00:27:47,326
Alas, not at my command.
And the Russians who were driven out

412
00:27:47,335 --> 00:27:49,397
have spread to the four corners of
the earth.

413
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:51,572
Who is this woman?
An old friend of yours?

414
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:55,719
No, she's the wife of an old friend.

415
00:27:55,732 --> 00:27:58,804
Oh, just see what you can do,
Shrimpie.

416
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:03,038
Aunt Violet - if I can still call
you Aunt Violet -

417
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:05,326
I ought to warn you about something.

418
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:08,161
I can guess what it is.
You won't approve.

419
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:09,619
No. I don't.

420
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,716
You may even feel the need to take
sides. Susan is your niece.

421
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:18,232
Well, I think you're making
a serious mistake, but you may
rest easy on that score.

422
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,913
I never take sides in a broken
marriage.

423
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,931
Why is that?

424
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,535
Because, however much the couple may
strive to be honest,

425
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,201
no-one is ever in possession of the
facts.

426
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:32,390
Are you in a hurry to leave
tomorrow?

427
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:35,432
Not at all. In fact, at the risk of
being a burden,

428
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,429
I thought I might stay another
night.

429
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:40,496
When are you off tomorrow?
He's staying for a couple of days.

430
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:44,179
Is he? Well, I hope we've got enough
here to amuse you.

431
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:50,444
Come into the library.
Excuse me.

432
00:28:51,173 --> 00:28:54,143
Why not invite Miss Bunting to
dinner tomorrow night?

433
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,845
Mary will be back - we'll be quite a
party. Edith, persuade him.

434
00:28:57,857 --> 00:29:00,155
I don't think Papa would think it a
very good idea.

435
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:03,647
What's this? I wanted Torn to invite
Miss Bunting to dinner tomorrow,

436
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,833
but Edith says Robert won't allow
it.

437
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:08,971
Nonsense. Of course you must bring
her, if you like. I insist.

438
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:14,667
So, you've enjoyed Bombay for the
most part? Oh, yes.

439
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,516
It's a wonderful city, the gateway
to the glories of the East.

440
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:20,461
I felt very privileged.

441
00:29:22,424 --> 00:29:25,359
I gather things have not improved
with Susan.

442
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:27,010
No.

443
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:30,254
The times I've blessed you and Cora
for keeping Rose out of it.

444
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:33,134
What happens now?

445
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,513
Divorce, I'm afraid.
I can't see any other way.

446
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,375
But my dear chap, is it worth it?

447
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,073
Why can't you just live apart?

448
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:45,543
If you'd ever been as unhappy as I
am, you'd know why not.

449
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:53,986
Has Molesley gone to bed?

450
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes. Why?

451
00:29:56,814 --> 00:30:00,432
Mrs Patmore needs two more chafing
dishes first thing tomorrow.

452
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:03,024
You can tell him in the morning.

453
00:30:03,037 --> 00:30:05,438
You're not so pally now, are you?

454
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:07,399
Why are you still up?

455
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:10,673
I just want to get this finished.

456
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:15,617
Your father was never ill, was he?

457
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,577
I'm sorry?

458
00:30:17,578 --> 00:30:20,843
Are you the one who's ill? Is that
it? Is that why you went away?

459
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:26,190
What's it to do with you?
I'm right, aren't I?

460
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,396
You're ill, and you went away to be
treated,

461
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:31,544
and now you're trying to carry on
with the treatment yourself.

462
00:30:31,574 --> 00:30:34,589
Well, it has nothing to do with you,
so just leave me alone.

463
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:40,507
Robert asked why we couldn't stay
together, for the look of the thing.

464
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:42,457
I hope you see that we can't.

465
00:30:43,224 --> 00:30:45,431
But Daddy, where are you going to
live?

466
00:30:45,449 --> 00:30:47,599
Your mother will keep Upper Brook
Street.

467
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:50,637
I'm not sure where I'm going to go
yet, but I'll find something.

468
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,304
Oh, can I live with you?

469
00:30:53,316 --> 00:30:56,581
To be honest, I think you should
stay here for a while.

470
00:30:56,598 --> 00:30:59,204
The next part could be quite
unpleasant.

471
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:01,443
I'm learning from it, though.

472
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:05,085
I don't care how eligible some chap may be
- I'm not going to be bullied.

473
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,117
Fighting talk.
I mean it.

474
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:13,357
You all think that now I'm officially
'out', it's time to find my man.

475
00:31:13,376 --> 00:31:17,188
But I'm only going to marry if I'm
totally, absolutely in love.

476
00:31:18,939 --> 00:31:20,998
Of course.

477
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,053
When I find him, will you promise to
be on my side?

478
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:29,415
Promise you won't try to force me into a
'suitable' marriage, like you were forced.

479
00:31:29,423 --> 00:31:32,700
In other words, you're asking for a
blank cheque.

480
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:34,361
Yes.

481
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:36,626
That's just what I want.

482
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,034
Oh, my dearest one.

483
00:31:39,035 --> 00:31:43,051
On the subject of marriage, I have
no right to give advice,

484
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,016
let alone orders.

485
00:31:49,147 --> 00:31:52,196
'You must make haste to reach
Dieppe,

486
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:55,711
where you are to seek out a Mr
Avebury.

487
00:31:55,727 --> 00:31:59,550
He will arrange for you to be taken
aboard a packet and conveyed to safety,

488
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:03,046
but do not delay, if you hold your
mother dear.'

489
00:32:03,066 --> 00:32:05,228
Poor woman. I know how she felt.

490
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:10,814
'As for your collection, Mr Avebury
will do what he can,

491
00:32:10,815 --> 00:32:15,184
but I'd rather every canvas or
carving were tossed in the sea

492
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:19,337
to your being one extra hour in that
unhappy country.'

493
00:32:21,075 --> 00:32:23,681
I'm glad he didn't take her advice.

494
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,624
He did not.
He brought crates and crates over,

495
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:29,467
then went back after the Reign of
Terror to buy more.

496
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,086
And you have preserved them safely
in this beautiful place.

497
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,263
I'm glad you think it's beautiful.

498
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,193
I think everything about Downton is
beautiful, including its mistress.

499
00:32:39,206 --> 00:32:42,358
You mustn't say such things.
I have to, or I'll burst.

500
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,888
What's burst?

501
00:32:44,892 --> 00:32:47,486
I was just saying that...

502
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:52,015
being allowed to touch a painting
like this will make me burst.

503
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:55,696
It's wonderful to show it to someone
so appreciative. Yes.

504
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:58,511
No-one could say you're not
appreciative, Mr Bricker.

505
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:10,437
I can't be hearing this correctly.
I'm afraid you are.

506
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,609
So, you sleep with a man because he
wants to marry you,

507
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,870
but now you change your mind.
It's insane!

508
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,643
I'm sorry if you think so.

509
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:20,248
Well, I won't let it happen.
I love you and you love me.

510
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:21,909
At least, you told me so in
Liverpool.

511
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:24,104
I know, and I thought I meant it.

512
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:26,502
Well, what's changed?
I can't explain, exactly.

513
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:28,544
But something has. That's all.

514
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,360
Am I a bad lover'? Is that what
you're trying to tell. me?

515
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:33,560
Don't be silly. It's not that at
all.

516
00:33:33,573 --> 00:33:37,066
It's just, I feel I've sort of...
woken up out of a dream.

517
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:40,375
How flattering! We go to
bed together and you wake up!

518
00:33:40,376 --> 00:33:43,528
I'm just not sure we have enough in
common, to make a go of things.

519
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:45,364
Well, I refuse to accept it.

520
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:48,188
I refuse to believe that a woman
like you, a lady,

521
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:51,715
could give herself to a man without first
being certain that he was the one.

522
00:33:51,724 --> 00:33:55,103
So, what are you saying? This is
something we've got to get through.

523
00:33:55,107 --> 00:33:58,065
And we will. We will get through
this together.

524
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,211
Mr Molesley. You wanted to see me?

525
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:15,749
Only to say

526
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:19,336
that I'm not sure I should be called the
First Footman, after all, Mr Carson.

527
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:21,292
Are you not?
No.

528
00:34:21,308 --> 00:34:23,822
Well, it's not like the old days, is
it?

529
00:34:23,847 --> 00:34:29,263
I mean, the duties of the First Footman
are shared between a lot
of people now, aren't they?

530
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:31,993
Are they?
Well, they should be...

531
00:34:31,997 --> 00:34:35,695
because I've got the duties of the
Second and Third Footman to deal with.

532
00:34:35,702 --> 00:34:40,401
So, you don't feel you need the precedence
that the title 'First Footman' confers?

533
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:45,193
Er... well, not really, no.

534
00:34:46,064 --> 00:34:47,919
Very well.

535
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,651
I'll see what I can do.

536
00:34:59,956 --> 00:35:03,005
I wasn't sure you'd want to come.
Nonsense.

537
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:05,182
I'm flattered to be asked.

538
00:35:05,183 --> 00:35:08,483
I didn't think I would be again.
Not after last time.

539
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:10,414
Try to be nice to him tonight.

540
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:15,118
I will be, if he's nice to me.

541
00:35:15,142 --> 00:35:19,409
I know you don't like him, or any of
them, much,

542
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,422
but you forget one thing -
they are good to me, in their way.

543
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:25,585
And I love them.

544
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:31,441
I don't want you to hate them.

545
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,120
Just to realise that you're more
than a retainer.

546
00:35:34,135 --> 00:35:37,821
I can't bear for you to waste your life
propping up a system that's dying.

547
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:41,427
Well, it won't die before dinner.

548
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:47,777
Someone's dropped this in the
passage. The London Magazine.

549
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:51,614
Does it belong to any of you?
Mr Barrow was reading it earlier.

550
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:55,093
Would you give it to him when he
comes down, Miss Baxter? Of course.

551
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,928
Where did you get this?
Have you been in my room?

552
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:13,998
Of course not. You dropped it in the
passage. Mrs Hughes found it.

553
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:17,491
Mrs Hughes found it, but Miss Baxter
read it.

554
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:20,746
I'm sorry for what you've gone
through, if what I think is correct.

555
00:36:20,758 --> 00:36:22,726
Don't you pity me.

556
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,219
Don't you dare pity me.

557
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:32,156
Did you bring the photographs of
Della Francesca's Nativity?

558
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:36,265
I certainly did. We can compare them
to the painting tomorrow.

559
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:39,630
It would be so lovely if it does
turn out to be a study for it.

560
00:36:39,641 --> 00:36:42,599
Yes. It would be absolutely lovely.

561
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:46,628
Mr Bricker, one more word and I will
ask you to sit somewhere else!

562
00:36:46,647 --> 00:36:50,038
He flatters her. He keeps asking her
opinion on everything.

563
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,980
Well, don't you ever ask her
opinion?

564
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,995
Of course I do. Sometimes.

565
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,450
Did you have a good time in London?
Quite good.

566
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:59,780
I set myself rather a difficult
task,

567
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:02,450
and it's always a relief when it's
done, isn't it?

568
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:08,600
- How are your lessons going?
- What's this?

569
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:11,775
Miss Bunting is giving instruction
to Mrs Patmore's undercook.

570
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,608
Oh, yes. I heard about that.

571
00:37:13,623 --> 00:37:16,490
You sound as if you don't approve.
I approve.

572
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:19,831
As long as you're not making... her
unsettled.

573
00:37:20,285 --> 00:37:22,891
You don't know her name, do you?

574
00:37:22,928 --> 00:37:25,630
Sarah, please.
Of course he does.

575
00:37:25,631 --> 00:37:27,565
Daisy.

576
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,817
Well, he knows it now.
I knew it before.

577
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:36,320
And it sounds as if you're upsetting
her and Mrs Patmore.

578
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,602
I think you should drop this.

579
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:42,904
Why don't you send for her'?
Bring Daisy in and ask her yourself.

580
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm sure she's too busy. Not too busy
to answer a summons from you.

581
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:48,430
We don't want to embarrass her.

582
00:37:49,388 --> 00:37:51,083
Carson?

583
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:55,881
This is the busiest time of their day,
m'lord. Maybe it would be better -

584
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:58,061
No. Fetch her.

585
00:37:58,065 --> 00:38:00,022
And ask Mrs Patmore to come up, as
well.

586
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,503
Very good, m'lord.

587
00:38:07,887 --> 00:38:09,844
Your father may regret this.

588
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,728
I wondered if you wanted a hand.
Almost done.

589
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,976
You could put the cases away, if
you've a mind.

590
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:26,658
Did you enjoy yourself?
We weren't there long enough.

591
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:31,063
I went to deliver a letter to Lord
Gillingham in Albany.

592
00:38:31,064 --> 00:38:32,778
Oh, yes?

593
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,089
Then I walked into Piccadilly.

594
00:38:35,116 --> 00:38:37,016
His Lordship's lucky to live there.

595
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:40,539
Do you recall Mr Green saying that?
Saying what?

596
00:38:41,534 --> 00:38:44,572
Jimmy heard where he lived and
called him a lucky tyke.

597
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,068
He wasn't very lucky in the end,
though, was he?

598
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:49,812
No. He wasn't lucky in the end.

599
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:53,751
Right. I'll take these up to the
luggage room.

600
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:11,359
Is something wrong with the dinner,
m'lord? Not at all.

601
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,506
We apologise, Mrs Patmore,

602
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:19,188
for interfering with your duties in
this strange and inconsiderate way.

603
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,273
Mrs Patmore, Carson tells me

604
00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:25,097
you feel Daisy's lessons have
disturbed the peace of the kitchen.

605
00:39:25,107 --> 00:39:28,029
Did you say that?
I don't know what I said.

606
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,233
I was upset
about that other business.

607
00:39:30,266 --> 00:39:32,753
I wondered if it were true. Daisy?

608
00:39:32,754 --> 00:39:35,030
Well, I'm sorry if I've made trouble
downstairs.

609
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:36,910
Well, you haven't. Not really.

610
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:39,109
But I must say this, m'lord.

611
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,308
Miss Bunting here has opened my eyes to
a world of knowledge I knew nothing of.

612
00:39:43,325 --> 00:39:45,510
Maybe I'll stay a cook all my life,

613
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:50,326
but I have choices now, interests,
facts at my fingertips.

614
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:53,966
And I'd never have had any of that
if she hadn't come here to teach me.

615
00:39:53,973 --> 00:39:55,759
Brava. Well said.

616
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,373
Quite a testimonial.
May we go, m'lord?

617
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,559
We've still got the pudding and the
savouries.

618
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,515
Of course. Thank you.

619
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:10,542
Obviously, the lessons have proved
successful.

620
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:12,495
I'm pleased to hear it.

621
00:40:12,915 --> 00:40:14,679
Are you, Lord Grantham?

622
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:17,517
Oh, for heaven's sake, let it go.
You've proved your point.

623
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,256
Have I, though? All I've proved is
that Lord Grantham

624
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:23,510
would like us serfs to stay in our
allotted place from cradle to grave.

625
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:26,036
There is only one thing I
would like...

626
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,310
and that I would like passionately.

627
00:40:28,311 --> 00:40:31,591
It is to see you leave this house
and never come back!

628
00:40:36,711 --> 00:40:38,611
Happy now?

629
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:45,592
Edith, dear, are you still writing
that very interesting column?

630
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:47,095
Yes, Granny.

631
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,301
Oh, you must show me some of them.

632
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:51,137
What is the latest one about?

633
00:40:52,477 --> 00:40:56,050
What are they all about?
The way the world is changing.

634
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:03,145
What's happening? What's all the
commotion?

635
00:41:04,692 --> 00:41:06,660
He just left the room.

636
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:08,607
Oh, I don't mean to interrupt.

637
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:11,607
No, no. We were just discussing the
Battle of Little Bighorn.

638
00:41:11,608 --> 00:41:13,318
The Battle of Little Minx, more
like.

639
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,585
To speak to His Lordship in that
manner! In his own house.

640
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,548
It's true, then? I thought Mr Barrow
might be exaggerating.

641
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:21,404
It seems he wasn't, for once.

642
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:24,786
Mr Branson must be horrified to have
brought her here.

643
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,564
I don't know.

644
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,787
I like him, but sometimes I think
we've forgotten the Mr Branson
that was down here with us,

645
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:33,845
spouting Keir Hardie between every
mouthful.

646
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:36,777
They've made him one of them in a
way, but it's not who he really is.

647
00:41:36,781 --> 00:41:40,001
Then it makes me wonder whether
Downton is the place for him.

648
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,131
A question I'm sure he's asked
himself many times.

649
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:47,408
I can't stand that woman.
No great surprise there.

650
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:49,691
I suppose you think I made a fool of
myself.

651
00:41:49,703 --> 00:41:52,968
What does it matter? I don't see
that you were much better.

652
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,322
Flirting and twinkling with that
ghastly travelling salesman.

653
00:42:00,596 --> 00:42:03,736
Go to sleep, and when you wake up,

654
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,590
make sure you get out of bed on the
right side.

655
00:42:23,401 --> 00:42:25,520
Good night, Tom.

656
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:28,365
And cheer up.
You gave Granny a wonderful evening.

657
00:42:37,397 --> 00:42:39,343
Well, what a to-do!

658
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,422
It seems to me your friend Miss
Bunting is out to make trouble.

659
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,132
She's brought me to life, Mrs
Patmore.

660
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:50,191
All the same, she wouldn't win a
popularity contest upstairs.

661
00:42:50,198 --> 00:42:52,565
Would you like to write a letter to
the War Office?

662
00:42:52,566 --> 00:42:55,210
Oh, don't be daft.
I mean it.

663
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:58,907
If you think Archie's been badly
treated, you must protest.

664
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:01,774
I wouldn't know how to write a
letter like that.

665
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:04,600
I can write it for you.
It won't do any good.

666
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:07,705
His Lordship says there are rules in
place. He wouldn't lie.

667
00:43:07,706 --> 00:43:11,450
No, but if you protest and then, over the
years, more and more others protest,

668
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:13,660
then they might change their blessed
rules.

669
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:16,039
This is your learning, isn't it?

670
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,685
That's what you're trying
to show me - you're not afraid.

671
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:20,625
No, I'm not.

672
00:43:21,218 --> 00:43:23,277
Well, go on, then.

673
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:25,105
We'll do it tomorrow.

674
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:40,730
How can we help you this time?
It's an odd business.

675
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:43,809
Since all this started, they've kept
a plain-clothes man on watch

676
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,871
at Lord Gillingham's set in Albany,

677
00:43:45,896 --> 00:43:50,265
and now I'm told that Mrs Bates was
seen there, loitering outside.

678
00:43:50,281 --> 00:43:52,636
Well, I know why that would be.

679
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,371
Lady Mary must have wanted to see Lord
Gillingham while she was in London.

680
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:59,192
No doubt, Anna was sent with a
message to arrange a meeting.

681
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,696
I knew you'd have something sensible
to say. Sergeant?

682
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,994
Well, it seems likely.

683
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:08,363
But from there, Mrs Bates walked
into Piccadilly,

684
00:44:08,372 --> 00:44:11,086
to the spot where Mr Green died.

685
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:13,966
There's no possibility she might
have a grudge against him,

686
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:15,767
that Mr Bates might share?

687
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:19,612
Not that I'm aware.
As I recall, she rather liked him.

688
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:23,334
Mrs Hughes?
Yes, she liked him. So she said.

689
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:27,033
They may want to question her, but before
they do, they want me to check one thing.

690
00:44:27,045 --> 00:44:30,743
She was definitely here on the day
of his death? Here at Downton?

691
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,020
I believe so.
Surely, you can't think that Mrs -

692
00:44:36,045 --> 00:44:39,117
I'm not paid to think, Mrs Hughes.
Just to record the facts.

693
00:44:40,773 --> 00:44:44,641
Hong Kong? A lot of the Tsarist
sympathisers ended up there.

694
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:48,681
How did they survive?
As servants and taxi drivers.

695
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,998
Milliners and prostitutes. Anything
they could lay their hand to.

696
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:57,874
I will not suggest to which of those
callings the Princess Kuragin
was most suited.

697
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,880
If you dislike her so much, why are
you going to all this trouble?

698
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:02,950
Because I owe it to her.
Why?

699
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,336
By the way, Susan has written to
Annabel

700
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:09,181
to say that she's furious that
you've all taken me in.

701
00:45:09,182 --> 00:45:13,556
Oh, dear Susan has been in a rage
since she was playing with her dolls.

702
00:45:13,603 --> 00:45:15,742
I am proof against her tantrums.

703
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,508
I would rephrase that if you want to
stay neutral.

704
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,977
I won't take sides - it's true.

705
00:45:21,938 --> 00:45:24,942
But I don't think I could ever be
described as 'neutral'.

706
00:45:29,165 --> 00:45:32,117
Have you apologized to Tom?

707
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:36,043
I never knew anyone who could provoke me
into saying so many things I don't believe.

708
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:38,786
But I am sorry, Tom.
Please forgive me.

709
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,957
She knows how to goad you.
With the precision of a surgeon.

710
00:45:41,958 --> 00:45:44,703
Why do you go on with her?
Since Sybil. died,

711
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:48,489
I've forgotten what it's like to be with
someone who feels about things as I do.

712
00:45:48,508 --> 00:45:51,250
That's why. Or that's been why.

713
00:45:51,257 --> 00:45:55,046
To me, it's as if you'd joined us
and now you're backing away.

714
00:46:00,185 --> 00:46:02,597
What are we doing here?

715
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:06,198
I want to explain why I think we
should turn down Wavell's offer.

716
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:09,930
I know. We are only the caretakers
of Downton.

717
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:11,868
But Papa, some things have to
change.

718
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:15,463
True. But we mustn't destroy what
we're trying to protect.

719
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:19,638
Wavell would wreck this lovely place
for ever, with his ugly, cheap houses.

720
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:22,477
But you can't block all development.
I won't.

721
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:25,300
I intend to expand, but without
spoiling.

722
00:46:25,311 --> 00:46:27,598
I'm going to make a plan and find a
solid builder

723
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:30,316
who can fit in to the village and not
ruin it.

724
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:32,648
That may be hard to achieve.
It may be harder

725
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:36,430
than cashing Wavell's cheque, but
does that mean we shouldn't we

726
00:46:36,457 --> 00:46:38,300
No.

727
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,147
We will build.

728
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,994
We'll even make money for the
estate.

729
00:46:42,995 --> 00:46:46,290
But we won't destroy what people
love about this place.

730
00:46:46,295 --> 00:46:48,127
Do you think that's wrong?

731
00:46:48,133 --> 00:46:50,431
No. It's not wrong.

732
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:52,381
That's all I'm asking.

733
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,946
Have any of you heard of someone
called Atticus Aldridge?

734
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:06,254
I should think carefully before you
say one more word.

735
00:47:06,265 --> 00:47:09,784
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing.

736
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:13,257
Margie feels you want the child to be
your plaything. How can she say that?

737
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:16,618
And you liked Mr Green?
Yes, I did. Very much.

738
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:20,248
You despise the family, but I think
you forget - my child is one of them.

739

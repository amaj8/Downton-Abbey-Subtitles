1
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,080
Are you taking it out? Oh...

2
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,510
Look at this. A man in misery.

3
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,950
-Who's in misery?
-The King, according to Robert.

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,670
-Why? -He has to deal with a Labour
government. Why do you think?

5
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,430
He doesn't look miserable to me.
He just looks like himself.

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,790
What is your objection to Mr
MacDonald? That the Prime Minister
is the son of a crofter?

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,030
I couldn't care less if he was
the son of Fu Manchu.

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,430
What worries me is that our
government is committed

9
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,430
to the destruction of people like us
and everything we stand for.

10
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,030
Well, let's wait and see what
happens before we panic.

11
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,870
-Where's Edith? -She had some old lady
to see in the village.

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,470
-What about you? Is everything
settled at the school? -What's this?

13
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,310
They swore in Mr Adams' replacement
on the school board. It all went off
smoothly.

14
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,430
-I thought they might have asked me.
-I feel guilty about the school.

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,990
I ought to support it more.

16
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,670
Well, I'm giving away the prizes
this year. Come with me.

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,390
Barrow, can we clear the tea?

18
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,030
Lady Edith's missed it, and Nanny
will be down shortly.

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,110
-I'd better run.
-Oh, stay and see them.

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,790
Just as soon as they're able to
answer back.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,750
-Sybbie CAN answer back.
-True. Why does she call me Donk?

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,310
That game you played - pinning the
tail on the donkey.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,790
Can't I be Grandpapa or something
dignified?

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,750
I'm afraid it's Donk for the moment.

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,510
-I don't want George to catch it.
-Here they are.

26
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,030
-Here's your grandfather now.
-Bye-bye, darlings. -Goodbye, Donk.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,160
George, come and sit here, darling.

28
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,070
-Put it there and I'll see to it.
-Oh, don't be like that.

29
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,670
Ena can manage.

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,910
Why should she, any more than me?
We've no proper kitchen maid now, so
we must all muck in.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,950
-What's the matter? -Daisy's grumbling
because they didn't replace Ivy.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,110
At Skelton Park, they're down to a
butler, a cook, two maids and a
cleaning woman, and that's it.

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,510
-How on earth does it work?
-I couldn't tell you.

34
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,710
Why have the people left?

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,470
They prefer to be in factories or
shops. They like the hours better.

36
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,790
Oh...I'll forget my head next.

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,150
I came in to remind you it's their
34th wedding anniversary on Saturday
week,

38
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,830
so, if you want to do a cake, this
is an advance warning.

39
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,790
-I suppose there'll be a dinner of
some sort. -Oh, I don't know.

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,430
34 years! If I were to marry this
year, what would life be like in
1958?

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,110
I doubt I'll be troubled by it.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,070
Do you think we'll leave service?

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,390
Well, you'll be fine. You've got Mr
Mason's farm to go to. What about
me?

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,990
But could I? What do I know about
farming or ordering supplies or doing
accounts?

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,070
Suppose I can't tackle a new life.

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,870
If it's all right with you, I've to
tackle tonight's dinner.

47
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Now, start the salmon pates,
while I do a lemon mayonnaise.

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,710
We had good news today. Tim was asked
to be chief of the estate firemen.

49
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, how nice. Many congratulations.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,080
-Can I give you some more tea?
-No, thank you.

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,110
How about you, Marigold? Are you
quite finished?

52
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,310
I just love to see her gurgling
away, so peaceful and happy.

53
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,950
We've almost forgotten she's not one
of our own, haven't we, Tim?

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,190
She's just lovely. How pretty your
hair is, darling.

55
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,950
I do wonder where she got her
colouring, but I never knew her
parents.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,790
-No?
-No.

57
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,560
Her mother was an old friend of
Tim's, but I never met either of
them.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,960
Oh, is that the time? We mustn't
hold you up.

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Good girl.

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Good girl.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,510
-I should probably go.
-Have you got your teddy?

62
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Say goodbye.

63
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Goodbye.

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,320
Thank you for... Thank you.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,710
She's got a soft spot for you.

66
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't be daft.

67
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,390
I do love this evening light.

68
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Oh, I must tell Lord Merton.

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,670
Tease me if you will, but I don't
want to be pursued by him or Lord
anyone.

70
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,630
Well, that's a pity - he's asked me
to help him in his courtship.

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,790
-What?
-He doesn't want to pester you,

72
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,110
so he's asked if I could give another
luncheon party.

73
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,190
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, why the lamentation?

74
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,150
You don't have to see him.

75
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,830
Well, you make it sound so easy.

76
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,510
There's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like.

77
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,470
Avoiding one's friends - that's the
real test.

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,230
But I do like him.
I think he's very nice.

79
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,230
It's just, he wants something from
me that I cannot give.

80
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,150
He just wants what all men want.

81
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

82
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I was referring to companionship.

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,800
As I hope you were.

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,590
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.

85
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,870
I'm sorry. It's a letter from Lady
Anstruther again.

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,030
Blimey. She doesn't give up easily.

87
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,630
Well, you know me.
'Irresistible' is my middle name.

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,790
-Well, was she like this when you
were working for her? -Not as bad.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,270
She had to be more discreet with the
other servants.

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,270
Hadn't you better go up to London
and put her out of her misery?

91
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,750
Oh, don't tempt me...

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,950
because I know this: If I weaken,
I'll pay for it.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,190
This sounds very like the kind of
boys' talk I do not allow.

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,950
If you can both tear yourselves away
from your smutty deliberations,

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I need you both upstairs.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,830
-Where is she?
-I hope I'm not late.

97
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,310
-No, Carson hasn't come in yet.
-That reminds me.

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,990
We're to receive a village delegation
tomorrow. I ran into the
Postmistress.

99
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,030
She asked if they might pay us a
visit.

100
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,710
-Mrs Wigan?
-What was it that reminded you?

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,390
-She asked for Carson to be present.
-Why? What's it about?

102
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,550
-They want to erect some kind of
memorial to the war. -What?

103
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,710
Well, not to the war, but to the men,
the local men, who died in it.

104
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,910
They'll be all over the country.
I suppose they want me as chairman.

105
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,590
-Who was it?
-Tony Gillingham.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,310
He had some business up here, and
you told him he could stay.

107
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,470
-When does he want to come?
-That's the problem. The 16th.

108
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,150
-And...?
-It's our anniversary.

109
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,470
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Ring him and say yes.

110
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,950
-We don't have to.
-No. I'd like to see him.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,270
Right. That's dinner, everyone.

112
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,150
-You don't mind Tony coming, do you?
-Not if it's what you want.

113
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,080
I'll tell you what I want.
I want to inspire Tony Gillingham
with thoughts of marriage.

114
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,910
So, does that mean Lord Gillingham
wins and Mr Blake can go whistle?

115
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,390
I'm glad for them. Viscountess
Gillingham - it sounds quite smart.

116
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,310
I think they'll be happy, and it'll
be good for Master George.

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,910
It's a big thing, to take on the
task of raising another man's son.

118
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,600
There's nothing to worry about
there. His Lordship's a kind man.

119
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,960
I wish you'd tell me what you know
about those two.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,150
I don't know anything.

121
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,830
What you suspect, then. And don't
deny it, because I've seen you.

122
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,790
You can't stop looking at them when
you think no-one's looking.

123
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,030
-Can I join in?
-Do you have to?

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,110
How was it in York? Did you find
what you were looking for?

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,070
I did. Took a bit of a search,
but I think I'm suited.

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,270
-What's that, then?
-Oh, just something.

127
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,990
A group's arriving from the village
tomorrow morning.

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,390
Can you get one of the footmen to
bring coffee and something to eat
at 11?

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,510
-Well, find me when you want it.
-I can't. I'm in the meeting myself.

130
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,350
That's why I'm telling you now.

131
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,950
-What's it for? -I don't know, but His
Lordship asked me to be there.

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,670
Well, I think it's fantastic.

133
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,430
When did we last have a Prime
Minister who understood the working
class? Never.

134
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,910
It's a qualification that is
meaningless in terms of government.

135
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,030
I'm not sure I can agree with you
there. I think it's important.

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,790
Me too. Mr MacDonald will have real
experience of a hard life.

137
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,630
He knows what most people go
through.

138
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,150
-Up the workers.
-So, James is a revolutionary now!

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,510
He's not a revolutionary.
He believes in justice for the
majority. What's wrong with that?

140
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,590
Nothing, but I suppose he can fight
his own battles.

141
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,480
We'll have no fighting here,
thank you very much.

142
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,150
You wouldn't mind heading
the war-memorial appeal, would you?

143
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,510
I feel a bit embarrassed.
I wasn't wounded.
I wasn't even allowed to fight.

144
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,790
They should ask a man like General
McKee or Johnnie Raymond. Someone who
did their bit.

145
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,430
You're their traditional leader and
they like you to pray with them, in
mourning and in gratitude.

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
But I should be praying in the back
row, not the front. That's all.

147
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,510
-Please don't think us too forward.
-You have no need to worry.

148
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,270
I'm happy to play my part.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,670
-But we don't know yet where we want
the memorial to be, m'lord. -So...?

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,630
Well, if you're to give us a piece
of land, you'd better know where it
is before you agree.

151
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,110
I'm sure I will agree, but is that
why you're here?

152
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,790
To ask for a piece of land as the
site for this thing?

153
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,950
That's why we're here to see you,
m'lord.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,230
But we'd also like to offer the
position of Chairman of our
Committee -

155
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,910
-I'll take over now.
-You were saying...?

156
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,840
We'd like Mr Carson to be Chairman
of our Committee.

157
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,630
But surely, His Lordship...?

158
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,950
No, Carson.
They don't want me - they want you.

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,790
I wouldn't put it like that, m'lord,

160
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,150
but Mr Carson knew more of the young
men that died than you did.

161
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,830
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Well, he knew them better.

162
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,710
That's it. And he's a considerable
figure in the village.

163
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Tea, please.

164
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,470
-Carson? What do you say?
-I am honoured by the invitation,

165
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,430
but I shall have to think about it.

166
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,470
Of course you will.
But please don't take too long.

167
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,000
Can you put my milk in first,
if that's for me?

168
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,910
-Did that come in the second post?
-It did.

169
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
From Lady Anstruther.

170
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,910
Not again? What's stoked her up?

171
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,310
My fault. I shouldn't have sent her
the Valentine.

172
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,390
-Yes, but that was -
-And I sent her another this year.

173
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,870
-How did she know they were from you?
-Because I bloody signed them. -Oh!

174
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,310
I don't know what I was thinking.
It was supposed to be a joke.

175
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,110
But, well, now it's got out of hand.

176
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,430
Don't worry.

177
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,470
One day I'll be a good boy and
settle down. We all settle down one
day.

178
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
We don't all have the option.

179
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,470
Heavens! I wasn't expecting you.

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,870
I've been to see Smithers at Oak
Field Farm. I just thought I'd look
in on my way home.

181
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I'm glad you did.

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,110
I had a delegation from the village,

183
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,430
about the new war memorial
they're putting up.

184
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,870
-Oh, they want you to head it?
-No.

185
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,150
They've invited Carson to be the
Chairman.

186
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,910
-Well, why not you?
-The village wanted Carson.

187
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,630
Your father always told the village
what they wanted.

188
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,990
Hmm.

189
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,550
Is it true old Dicky Merton
is paying court to Isobel?

190
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,870
Isn't it absurd?

191
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,310
Oh, it might be rather fun for her
to reinvent herself as a great lady
of the county

192
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,350
and put us all in our proper place.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,390
Yes, I suppose it would be fun.

194
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,470
But you don't think she's keen?

195
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Oh, no, far from it. She never tires
of telling me.

196
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,510
Daisy, this came for you in the
post.

197
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,710
-Thank you, Mr Carson.
-Oh, what is it?

198
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,710
Something I ordered.

199
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,630
-May we know what, O Queen?
-Something I need.

200
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,630
Why must it be a secret?

201
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,160
Well, it would be a bit sad if she
had no secrets at her age.

202
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,950
Have you made your decision about
the memorial?

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,230
Oh, not yet.

204
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,430
I'm not comfortable being placed
ahead of His Lordship.

205
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,790
You should have seen his face,
Mrs Hughes. He felt very let down.

206
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,390
It's the Committee's choice,
and they've chosen you.

207
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,040
And the country's chosen a Labour
government, so people don't always
get it right.

208
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,830
What are you afraid of?

209
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,670
I feel a shaking of the ground
I stand on.

210
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,190
That everything I believe in will be
tested and held up for ridicule
over the next few years.

211
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,230
Mr Carson, they've been testing the
system since the Romans left.

212
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,030
Oh, I suppose that's true.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,520
The nature of life is not permanence
but flux.

214
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,790
Just so...

215
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,320
even if it does sound faintly
disgusting.

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,030
There you are, m'lady.
Madge said you were going out.

217
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,470
We were giving a turn-out to the
blue room,

218
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,190
and this had been put on the shelf
with the other books.

219
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,150
-What is it? -A German primer, but the
point is, it's not ours.

220
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,830
-Mr Gregson's written his name
in the fly-leaf. -I see.

221
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,310
I nearly gave it to Her Ladyship,
but it seemed more suitable -

222
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,160
No. I'm the one who should have it.

223
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,550
Can you please put it on the table
beside my bed?

224
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,600
-Of course.
-Thank you.

225
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,390
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon. -Thank you, Molesley.

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,590
It's good of you to come with us.

227
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,670
I must have something to do.

228
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,320
-Where's your mother?
-In the library.

229
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,230
I'm not sure Tom's visiting the
school is such a good idea.

230
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,390
He made a friend there of one of the
schoolmistresses when we were in
London.

231
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,190
What's wrong with that?

232
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,110
I don't intend to explain, but I was
rather disappointed in him.
I would have hoped for better.

233
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,950
You're being very mysterious.
Can't I know the details?

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You really don't need to.

235
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,070
There you are. How were they?

236
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,670
As dull as ever. They sent love.

237
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,950
What was the meeting like?
Have you accepted?

238
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,070
It wasn't me they came to see.
Well, they want me to give them some
land for the thing,

239
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,150
but they asked Carson to be the
Chairman.

240
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,520
Carson? Well, how nice.

241
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm going upstairs to take off
my hat.

242
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Well, she's pleased, anyway.

243
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Congratulations.

244
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,510
I'm sure you will want me to thank
Lady Rose for consenting to present
the prizes today.

245
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,030
We're always glad of interest from
the Abbey.

246
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,430
And finally, thank you all for
coming.

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
It is most appreciated.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,350
I'm glad Peter won a prize for
Geography. Well done, him.

249
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
He didn't get that from his father.

250
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,040
-Is Mrs Drewe with you? -No, she's at
home, looking after the young 'uns.

251
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,840
We ought to talk, but not here.

252
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
Tomorrow. At 11. By the stone barn.

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,310
-You've been away.
-I've been on a course.

254
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,550
I nearly wrote to tell you, but
I thought it might be presumptuous.

255
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,270
-Well, I'm pleased to see you back.
-That's a relief.

256
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,470
I thought I must have earned a black
mark, making you take me up to the
house that night.

257
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,790
-Hello, Miss Bunting.
-Lady Rose. Well done.

258
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,990
Oh, it's not exactly difficult -
giving out prizes.
I think we get thanked too much.

259
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,870
But that's the custom, isn't it?

260
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,470
We ought to head off, if we're to be
back before the gong.

261
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,960
The Rule of the Gong. It sounds like
life in a religious order!

262
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Goodbye.

263
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,000
-I'll see you again.
-I hope so.

264
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,390
Spratt...

265
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,520
Offer Dr Clarkson some cake.
Then you may go.

266
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Thank you.

267
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,710
I'm afraid serving me is a bit
beneath his dignity.

268
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,190
Even Spratt cannot always
live for pleasure.

269
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,870
Tell me: how well do you know
Lord Merton?

270
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,710
Erm...I don't, really.

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,950
Oh.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Because I thought you might be
amused by how friendly he and Mrs
Crawley have become.

273
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,030
What Mrs Crawley chooses to do with
her private life is her own affair.

274
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,950
Oh, dear. I've annoyed you.

275
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, no, no, I'm not annoyed...

276
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,710
..although I am surprised to learn
that she entertains notions

277
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,310
of passing her time at drawing-room
receptions

278
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,470
and taking carriage rides in the
park.

279
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,990
Well, no-one takes carriage rides in
the park any more.

280
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,350
That's quite gone.

281
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,430
I wouldn't know.

282
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,150
You ought to meet Lord Merton
properly.

283
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,470
Come to luncheon on Saturday.

284
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,550
Mrs Crawley will be here
and so will he.

285
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,310
Well, that's quite an honour,
Lady Grantham. Are you sure?

286
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,870
Oh, it'll be fun. I'm hoping to
persuade dear Lady Shackleton

287
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
to be one of our number.

288
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,870
Mama's gone to bed. She wanted an
early night. I might go up too.

289
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Come and sit here for a minute.

290
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,550
It doesn't really bother you they
want Carson, does it?

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
They'd be lucky to get him.

292
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,510
Even so, it makes you think.

293
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,670
Would a village delegation have
arrived in my grandfather's day

294
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,550
to ask his butler to head an appeal?

295
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,350
-We're not living in your
grandfather's day. -No, we are not.

296
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,550
So, they don't want me at the school
and they don't want me for the
memorial.

297
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Well, I want you.

298
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,760
I think you, Tom and I make a pretty
good team.

299
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,350
By the way, I've been looking into
crop rotation and grain sales -

300
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,190
And not every father hears that from
his daughter.

301
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Mr Barrow...

302
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,870
I'm tired of waiting, Miss Baxter.

303
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
I'm tired of being bullied.

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,440
I got you this job and you knew what
I wanted in return.

305
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
So don't complain about it now.

306
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,360
Thank you, Madge. Good night.

307
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,270
Did you know Dicky Merton was in hot
pursuit of Isobel?

308
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,830
Mama says she's desperate to throw
him off.

309
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,230
-I wonder.
-What do you mean?

310
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,790
I don't believe your mother would
enjoy the transformation of Isobel
into Lady Merton,

311
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,710
complete with a living husband,
a proper house and a solid position
in the county.

312
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,670
That would not suit Mama at all.

313
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,920
Oh, don't be ridiculous. She'd be
thrilled, if that was what Isobel
wanted.

314
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,990
Daisy, whatever are you doing up at
this hour? I thought you'd gone to
bed long ago.

315
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,390
I just wanted to look at these.

316
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
What is it?

317
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
You can tell me.

318
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,950
Arithmetic Part 1?
Cost Accounting? What is this?

319
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,830
I was rubbish at numbers at school.

320
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,670
Well, all the best people were
rubbish at numbers at school.

321
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,510
But I don't know anything.
You talk about my working at
Mr Mason's farm, but how?

322
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,150
I couldn't balance the books if my
life depended on it.

323
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,310
-Why do you need to? -Because I want
to be grown up, Mrs Patmore.

324
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,030
I want responsibility.
I want to be an adult.

325
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,390
I can't just stand here, following
orders, for the rest of my life.

326
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,830
Well, I do see that.

327
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,630
The trouble is, I'm too stupid to
make out one solitary word.

328
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,430
You're not stupid, Daisy.
Far from it.

329
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,160
Then why can't I understand what's
written? Why can't I follow it?

330
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,910
Because...

331
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,230
Because I'm a pig-ignorant idiot.

332
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

333
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,990
Is this your secret lair?

334
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,350
It's not very secret,
but this is where I work.

335
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,600
And where you can hide away from the
rest of us?

336
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,950
Why do you never ask that
Miss Bunting up to the house?

337
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,790
Maybe I will. One day.

338
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,310
-You live there too, you know.
-I'm not sure where I live.

339
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,430
I feel sometimes I'm hanging in
mid-air.

340
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,390
Well, you mustn't think we don't
want you to have your own life.

341
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,710
I don't think that of Mary or Edith
or you.

342
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,950
But it would be hard for Lord and
Lady Grantham.

343
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,070
-They'd have to get used to it.
-Easier said than done.

344
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
I'd better get on.

345
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,550
So, I have your permission to
accept?

346
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,310
You don't need it.
It has nothing to do with your work.

347
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,510
No, but I wouldn't want to think it
was disagreeable for you.

348
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,750
We'd be delighted, Carson.

349
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,070
You'll be able to steer it through
the perils of village politics.

350
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,030
But traditionally, I feel it should
have been you, m'lord.

351
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Maybe this will be a new tradition.

352
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,950
I know you hate not to be wanted,
but you're on so many committees.

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,920
What do you mean,
I hate not being wanted?

354
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,670
You think I'm taking too much
of an interest in Marigold.

355
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,150
-It's Margie.
-She thinks I'm there too often.

356
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,830
Because you've got a crush on me.

357
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,360
Well, that's better than the real
reason...

358
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,080
The real reason is a good reason to
love a child, m'lady.

359
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,400
Mothers should love their children.

360
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,480
-How long have you known?
-Since you asked me to take her in.

361
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,750
But you're quite safe.

362
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,800
It's not my place to judge you, and I
wouldn't, anyway.

363
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,990
But I should control my feelings?

364
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,830
I could say yes, but I don't believe
it's realistic.

365
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
I don't believe you could.

366
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Then what are you saying?

367
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,920
We need a way for you to live the
truth, without telling the truth.

368
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,070
The die is cast. I've accepted.

369
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,030
His Lordship told me to take it.

370
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,590
-There you are, then.
-But he was sad.

371
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,750
Not with me, but maybe because
things are changing.

372
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,400
Well, they are,
whether we're sad about it or not.

373
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,990
I hope you're right about
Lord Gillingham.

374
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,670
What would I have felt if I'd
inherited a family with you?

375
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,630
-You'd have loved them, I hope.
-I would,

376
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,790
but I can't deny I'd prefer one of my
own. You'd feel the same.

377
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,190
Well, they do say a mother's love is
the strongest love there is.

378
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,030
But that's all in God's hands.
There's nothing we can do.

379
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,510
-I can think of one thing. -Mr Bates,
that sort of talk is beneath you.

380
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I stand corrected.

381
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,990
-I'll have it out of you. -Fancy a
breath of air before the gong?

382
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

383
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,750
What's the matter with you? You've
not said a word all afternoon.

384
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,270
I went to the village and telephoned
her, to reason with her,

385
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,310
and I think it were a mistake.

386
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,350
It was never going to put her off.

387
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,390
Exactly.

388
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,430
The trouble is, she hates getting
older,

389
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,310
and I think that's at the bottom of
it.

390
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,910
Still, it's pathetic for a lady to
be pining over a footman.

391
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,750
Excuse me!

392
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I think it shows very good taste.

393
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,630
My dear Lady Shackleton, how kind.
And you're on your way somewhere?

394
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,670
I am and I can't stay.
I'm dining with Philip,

395
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,350
and his wife sulks all night if
you're a minute late.

396
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,470
You should write a book:
Daughters-In-Law And How To Survive
Them.

397
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,390
-I like yours.
-Yes, Cora does very well,

398
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,630
even if one cannot always rely on
her instincts.

399
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,030
I'd exchange her for mine in a trice.

400
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,110
Tell me: how well do you know
Lord Merton?

401
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,510
Oh, you know. We've seen each other
at parties for 40 years.

402
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,030
I worry that he's finding things
difficult since his wife died.

403
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,510
You're a widow.
You know what he's going through.

404
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,470
I suppose so, but I never saw them
as very devoted.

405
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,510
I should have thought he was glad to
be rid of her. I would be.

406
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,590
Then his sons are quite difficult.

407
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,590
I know what that's like.

408
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,950
Could you come to luncheon on
Saturday? Help me cheer him up?

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,710
-Well, I'd love to.
-Oh!

410
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,750
Of course, a single peer with a good
estate won't be lonely long,

411
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,790
if he doesn't want to be.

412
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,190
You sound like Mrs Bennett!

413
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,390
-But what's he on about? -He thinks
I know something about Mr Bates.

414
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,590
-And do you?
-Maybe.

415
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,230
Mr Bates may have done something he
wouldn't want known.

416
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,070
Do you mean a crime or...?

417
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,750
I'm not sure. I know he took a
journey, which I think he'd deny.

418
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,880
Look, I don't want to know any
more...

419
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,150
..but a pound to a penny,

420
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,840
Mr Barrow thinks he can use it
against Mr Bates.

421
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,430
Report him to Her Ladyship.
She'd soon put a stop to it.

422
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I can't.

423
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
It's complicated, but I can't.

424
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,390
What is it?

425
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,350
-What's what? -You're doing something
funny with your head.

426
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,630
Sort of...tilting it.

427
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:53,030
I'm not, am I?
How do you think I look?

428
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,320
Why? Have you got a rash?

429
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,030
No, I've not got a rash.

430
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,760
-That's all right, then.
-No, what I meant was...

431
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,510
How old would you say I am?

432
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,680
I don't know. Maybe...52?

433
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,120
-Oh.
-Why? How old are you?

434
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
51.

435
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,590
I've just had the strangest
telephone call.

436
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,070
-Oh?
-Do you remember Lady Anstruther?

437
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,350
-You mean Jock Anstruther's widow?
-That's it.

438
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,310
Her sister's Lady Renton and
her brother's Harry Mountevans.

439
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,750
I do remember her. Good-looking and
half Jock's age, and rather silly.

440
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,350
-Well, silly or not, she's just rung
up and asked herself for tea. -Oh.

441
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,190
Do people think we're a public house
on the Great North Road?

442
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,190
It certainly seems like it.

443
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,750
She's driving through the village on
Saturday and would love to see us.

444
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,470
-What did you say?
-Well, it's only tea.

445
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,870
Are we doing anything for your
anniversary?

446
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,510
-What had you in mind?
-Well, now that Tony's staying,

447
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,630
I thought we could invite some
people, make an evening of it.

448
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,910
Well, you girls ask some friends.

449
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,230
I'd like a young party for once,
instead of all those old duffers.

450
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,870
Hello.

451
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,040
Oh, Mary, I've got an idea.

452
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,030
I think it's sharp of Daisy to want
to learn to manage figures.

453
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,230
I'm afraid I agree with Mrs Patmore.

454
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,590
Why does she need to? She's a cook.

455
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,510
Cooks have to balance their budget.

456
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,870
She can learn enough for that
without being an expert in algebra.

457
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,630
She may not always be a cook.

458
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,430
Possibly not, but she won't be
Archimedes, either.

459
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,710
Sorry, but I don't think we should
encourage it.

460
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,990
I'm going up. I want to read a bit
before I turn out the light.

461
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,070
Oh, well done with your studies,
Daisy.

462
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,710
It's good to have more than one
string to your bow.

463
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,480
It's even better if you don't have
the brain of a kipper. Good night.

464
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,470
See? What did I tell you? She's lost
her confidence because of it.

465
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,520
And no mathematical skill
is worth that.

466
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,870
Why must Lady Anstruther choose
Saturday, of all days?

467
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,670
Ought we to invite her to
the dinner?

468
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,830
Isn't she staying somewhere else?

469
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,990
Tell me tomorrow who's coming, of
your pals. Keep the numbers even.

470
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,510
Well, Rose wants to invite a friend
of Tom's. He must feel so
outnumbered.

471
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,110
-Not that brother, I hope.
-Someone local. Rose has met her.

472
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,150
So have I. She's quite respectable.

473
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
I think it would be nice.

474
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,230
Looking forward to seeing
Lord Gillingham?

475
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,590
I only saw him in London last week,
so I can remember what he looks like.

476
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,390
But I expect it's difficult to get
time alone in London.

477
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,230
Less difficult than when
I was a girl.

478
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,840
But yes, it'll be good to see him
here.

479
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,550
I haven't made up my mind, if that's
what you're thinking.

480
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,600
I wasn't thinking anything, but I
suppose you'll have to some time.

481
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,200
The older I get, the more I feel we
do these things very oddly.

482
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,150
Even now we must decide whether to
share our lives with someone

483
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,230
without ever spending any real time
with them.

484
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,950
Let alone...you know.

485
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,990
Of course, these days, some women do.

486
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,390
I was talking to Lady Cunard's
daughter last week,

487
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,720
and she was so graphic,
I almost fainted.

488
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,400
But then, what could be more
important?

489
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,720
To make sure that that side of things
is right...

490
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,430
..before we tie ourselves to someone
for ever?

491
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,280
I'm afraid I'm too old-fashioned
for you, m'lady.

492
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,510
I need hardly say you're not to
repeat a word to Bates.

493
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
Of course not, m'lady.

494
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,350
What do you make of this?

495
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,310
Blimey. What does that mean?

496
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,910
As you know, Lord Gillingham arrives
today, but there's been no mention
of a valet.

497
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,670
-There was enough mention of the last
one. -Poor Mr Green. A terrible end.

498
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,750
Let's not rake over that now.

499
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,830
As I say, His Lordship may have a
valet, but these days we can't be
sure, so...

500
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,550
Yes, Mr Carson?

501
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,310
Not you. Mr Bates, would you keep
an eye on him, if necessary?

502
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,070
Certainly, Mr Carson.

503
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,280
-Mr Molesley, have you...?
-Have I what, Mr Carson?

504
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,400
Er...never mind.

505
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,590
Arms down. Relax.

506
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,510
I'm sorry. They've only just told me
you were waiting.

507
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,550
Oh, I've not been here long.

508
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,270
I wanted to see you after I read
your letter.

509
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,550
It wasn't meant to be confusing.

510
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,590
No. But why won't you come?

511
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,950
Because I don't want to be part of
some sort of a...prank.

512
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,910
What prank?

513
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,190
I may not have been presented at
Court, Lady Rose,

514
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,230
but I do know it's usual to be
invited to dinner by the hostess.

515
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,590
And shouldn't Mr Branson have played
a part in it?

516
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,870
Lady Grantham asked us to invite
some younger guests to liven up the
evening,

517
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,590
so Mary and I thought it would be
nice for Tom to have a friend there.
That's all.

518
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,670
I'm right, then? He doesn't know.

519
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,750
No, it would be a surprise for him,
but a nice surprise.

520
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,150
And Lady Grantham is aware of this?

521
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
Completely. She wants you to come.

522
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,710
I could have managed Lord Gillingham.
No need to burden Mr Bates with him.

523
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,790
I think Mr Carson forgets that
I'm a valet, too.

524
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,510
I know, and it seems a bit ironic
for Mr Bates to dress him.

525
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,790
-Why is it ironic?
-I don't know why I said that.

526
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Why did you say it, Miss Baxter?

527
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,750
Er...it was rubbish. Nonsense.

528
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,400
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late.

529
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,470
Oh, how nice. I wanted to call on
you, but I didn't like to be a
bother.

530
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,750
I've been quite busy lately, helping
with the out-patient clinic.

531
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,310
-Dr Clarkson.
-Oh. -Lady Grantham.

532
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,310
May I present Dr Clarkson?
I think you know Lord Merton.

533
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,870
I think we have met, yes.

534
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,790
-We were talking about your clinic.
-Oh, you mustn't bore him.

535
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,710
-As a matter of fact, I'd be
interested to - -The Lady Shackleton.

536
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,910
Oh, my dear, how prompt you are.

537
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,630
Your daughter-in-law has trained you
well.

538
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,790
Now, you remember Lord Merton?

539
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,110
Of course. How are you?

540
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,070
And how's that lovely garden of
yours?

541
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,350
Oh, still lovely. Largely because
I have the same lovely gardener.

542
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,230
I don't think we've met since dear
Lady Merton's funeral.

543
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,760
I do hope things are sorting
themselves out.

544
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,830
-You've gone to a lot of trouble.
-Mmm. I like to help where I can.

545
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,120
Oh, Spratt. Shall we go in?

546
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,230
-Lord Gillingham.
-Ah, here he is.

547
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,830
-Tony, welcome.
-Lovely to see you all.

548
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,510
-I'm afraid you've missed luncheon.
-I ate on the train.

549
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,080
-A cup of coffee, then?
-That would be perfect.

550
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,710
Carson, I must congratulate you.

551
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,070
They're building a memorial in the
village, and Carson is the Chairman.

552
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,510
I like the idea of these things.
To give people a solid focus for
their grief and gratitude.

553
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,950
I agree, My Lord. I hope
His Lordship's happy about it.

554
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,630
My being Chairman, I mean.

555
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,710
He is. Or, at any rate, he will be.

556
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,510
-So, how are the famous pigs doing?
-Pretty well.

557
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,630
They're earning their keep and more.

558
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,350
I'm going out this afternoon, to get
some rabbits for Mrs Patmore.
Come with me.

559
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,870
I'll find you a gun and you can see
what we've been up to.

560
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,470
I'll come too, although I warn you -
I'm not very good at picking up.

561
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,030
Well, if I'm shooting,
you won't have to.

562
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,080
That I do not believe.

563
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,390
-Could you spare me for an hour?
-I think everything's under control.

564
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,680
I just want to run down to the post
office. I won't be long.

565
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,430
So, will you be travelling north in
August for the grouse?

566
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,790
You talk as if my sole concern is
the sporting year, Dr Clarkson.

567
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,910
The truth is, these days, I hold a
book more often than a 12-bore.

568
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,350
-You must miss it.
-Not particularly. Thank you. -Er...

569
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,470
As a matter of fact, he's more
interested in medicine than sport.

570
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,350
I find that hard to believe.

571
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,070
-You sound a little prejudiced.
-Not at all.

572
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,510
He seems a nice enough example of
the type, I grant you.

573
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
Er...

574
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,710
But, as you say yourself, we're not
members of that tribe, you and I.

575
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,350
Spratt...

576
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,720
I think Dr Clarkson would like
some coffee.

577
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,190
And don't be such a snob.

578
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,190
I'm determined to get you over to
Sheriff Hutton.

579
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,710
The children are in the main house
now. I've been banished to a
cottage.

580
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,750
-Did you move before Hubert died?
-No.

581
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,150
To be honest, I didn't want to go at
all, but I've got used to it.

582
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,670
Apart from anything else, I've never
been warm before!

583
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Morning.

584
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,790
So, why did you talk about Mr Bates
and Lord Gillingham's valet?

585
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
What's the connection? Tell me.

586
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,480
There's no point trying to find
Mr Molesley...

587
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,880
..because he can't help you now.

588
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,790
If that's how you want to play it,

589
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,310
I'll give you until upstairs dinner
has finished,

590
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,270
after which I will ask to speak to
Her Ladyship and I will tell her
your story.

591
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Do you hear what I'm saying?

592
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,110
I can't tell you what I don't know.

593
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,160
But you know something.

594
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,600
And I think it links Mr Bates to the
dead valet.

595
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,350
I'm impressed by what
I've seen.

596
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,430
Tom's a good partner,
so I'm lucky.

597
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,110
I'm the lucky one.

598
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,310
-Tom, what about your American plans?
-Oh, I don't know. Nothing's fixed.

599
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,040
But never fear. Mary is more than
ready to manage without me.

600
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
That's your man.

601
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:14,390
So, you're not frightened of being
left on your own to control your
Papa?

602
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,590
I understand him better now,
and I think he'd say the same of me.

603
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,510
So he's not fighting all change,
then?

604
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,550
No, but he likes proper research.

605
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,350
You see, I want to improve
how we sell our grain.

606
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,030
If I make a good case for it,
he'll agree.

607
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,030
How positive you are.

608
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,910
I've decided to live in the present
and not spend my life

609
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,510
regretting the past or dreading the
future.

610
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,830
I shall try to follow your example.

611
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,990
Do you dread the future?

612
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Only if I have to live it
without you.

613
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,470
Tony, I do love you, you know.

614
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,230
In my cold and unfeeling way.

615
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,190
Then why not say yes?

616
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,270
I don't want to get it wrong.

617
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,190
I'd like to marry again.
I've come that far.

618
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,350
But I intend to be as happy with my
second husband as I was with my
first.

619
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,870
It's bound to be a risk on some
level.

620
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,240
You have to take a chance.

621
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,440
-The stable clock's fast.
-We ought to get back.

622
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,110
By the way, Bates will look after
you, if you haven't brought a man of
your own.

623
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,550
Oh, that's rather a luxury for me
these days. I have no valet now.

624
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,590
Our butler takes care of me at home,
but when I travel I usually fend for
myself.

625
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,470
-Do you mind?
-It makes things simpler.

626
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,840
I'd love to make our lives simpler.

627
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Hm.

628
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,870
It's a nightmare when guests are a
nuisance and I feel so guilty,

629
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,910
but I wasn't sure we were even going
to make it down the drive.

630
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,070
-But what happened, exactly?
-Well, there was this terrible noise.

631
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,150
A sort of rattle, rattle, bang,
bang.

632
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,990
And then the engine just seemed to
lose its power.

633
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:57,310
-We'll get Tom to take a look at it.
-Oh, how kind.

634
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,030
But I think my chauffeur, Weaver,
seems to have it in hand.

635
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,950
Could I just use your telephone

636
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,550
and tell my hosts I won't be able to
get to them tonight?

637
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,830
-But what will you do? -Oh, we passed
a public house in the village,

638
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,230
and I asked Weaver to see if they
had any rooms.

639
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,550
-You can't possibly stay at the pub.
-Why not? I'm tougher than I look.

640
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,030
You must stay here. We have people
coming to dinner, so it'll be easy.

641
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,310
-Oh, yes, it's perfect.
-Oh, that's sweet.

642
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,990
Molesley,
you look very Latin all of a sudden.

643
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,950
Do you have Italian blood?

644
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,800
-No, m'lord. Not that I'm aware.
-Or Spanish? Or Irish?

645
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,030
James...please tell Mrs Hughes that
Lady Anstruther will be staying.

646
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,030
If she could prepare
Princess Amelia.

647
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Very good, Your Ladyship.

648
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,430
-Go now. Tell her everything.
-You don't know what you're asking.

649
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,270
I may not know your story, but I do
know it'll be worse if Mr Barrow
tells her first.

650
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Yes. You're right.

651
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Thank you.

652
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,230
Why is she here?
They don't know her, do they?

653
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,030
-Well, if they do, she never told me.
-What are you going to say to her?

654
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,070
-Who says I'll get the chance to say
anything? -Go on. Have it out.

655
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,230
She's playing with you
like a cat with a vole.

656
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,790
James...did you know about
Lady Anstruther's visit?

657
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,550
-No, Mr Carson. Why should I?
-Didn't you work for her one time?

658
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,910
I'm sure I've got a reference
from her somewhere.

659
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,990
But that was quite a while back,
wasn't it?

660
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,030
Well, she's made extra work for
everyone.

661
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
That's all I know.

662
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,190
What do you mean, you need to tell
me something before Barrow does?

663
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,230
Mr Barrow wants to tell you about
something in my past, m'lady.

664
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,430
I've a secret, you see.
A bad secret.

665
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,030
I don't understand. What secret?
How does he know it?

666
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,350
I was a friend of his sister's
when we were young.

667
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,880
But if he knew something wrong about
you, why would he put you forward
for the job?

668
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I think you had better tell me.

669
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,310
Very well.

670
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,510
A few years ago, I worked in London,
as a lady's maid

671
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,400
for a Mrs Benton who...lived with her
husband in Ovington Square.

672
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,190
Go on.

673
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,120
I was there for about six months,
and then I...

674
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,870
And then you what?

675
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,920
I...

676
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,550
..took some jewellery belonging to
the mistress.

677
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,480
A necklace, a couple of bracelets,
some rings.

678
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
You took them?

679
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,070
I tried to make it look like a
burglary, but it didn't work.

680
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
And Mrs Benton reported the theft?

681
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,550
They took me up a few hours later.

682
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
My fingerprints were everywhere.

683
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
And to make it worse...

684
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,910
..I never gave the stolen things
back.

685
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Why not?

686
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,270
Because, by then, I didn't have them.

687
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,230
What happened?

688
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,880
I went to prison. For three years.

689
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,430
Thank you, Baxter.

690
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,480
Very good, m'lady.

691
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,390
What do you make of our
mysterious visitor?

692
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,110
Tom said he went to look at the car
and could find nothing wrong.

693
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,790
-Maybe the chauffeur mended it.
-Maybe.

694
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
We ought to go down.

695
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
Will there be anything else?

696
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,750
I don't think so. Thank you.
It's been quite a treat.

697
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,390
You don't travel with a valet
these days, m'lord?

698
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,880
No, no. When Green died,
I never replaced him.

699
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,990
We were all shocked by the death of
Mr Green so soon after he was here.

700
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,040
Yes. Of course.

701
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,160
-Had he been with you long?
-Not very long, no.

702
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
Right. Thank you.

703
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,880
-Well...?
-I told her.

704
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,960
Now, I'm not asking what you said,
but I want to be sure that you held
nothing back.

705
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,390
Good.

706
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,150
-How was she?
-I don't know.

707
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,590
Shocked, but not unkind.

708
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,910
Then His Lordship walked in,
so that was that.

709
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,430
The point is, if she allows you to
stay,

710
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,190
you're here in a truthful way and
not in a lie.

711
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,240
And if I'm not allowed to stay?

712
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,230
Well, you're still not caught
in a lie.

713
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
That's what matters.

714
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,950
I will tell you the story one day.

715
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,270
But I'm loath to...
forfeit your good opinion, and I know
I would.

716
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
No, you won't.

717
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,430
You don't trust me yet,
but I'm on your side.

718
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,830
Mr Molesley, I need that up in the
servery. Now.

719
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Yes, Mr Carson.

720
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,760
Jimmy...I ought to scold you.

721
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,270
Why did you ignore my letters?
You're a very naughty boy.

722
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,270
Show Her Ladyship where to find the
drawing room, James.

723
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,190
Of course.

724
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Will you come this way, m'lady?

725
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,110
I feel so guilty, pushing into
a family celebration.

726
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,200
-You'd be an ornament at any
gathering. -Oh, how nice. Thank you.

727
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,790
No cocktails?
I thought everyone had them now.

728
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:08,310
Not at Downton. Our butler tried
them once and he hasn't recovered.

729
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,310
Oh, look at your parents.

730
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:14,950
34 years. I'd never manage it.

731
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,150
That's the advantage of an older
husband. One gets an early release!

732
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Miss Sarah Bunting.

733
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,230
What on earth is she doing here?

734
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,720
I asked her. Cora said I could.

735
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,470
-Have I done something wrong?
-She's the teacher I told you about.

736
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,310
After her behaviour while we were in
London, I don't think she's a
suitable guest.

737
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:39,790
Let me introduce you.
Kitty Colthurst. Sarah Bunting.
Miss Bunting's a teacher.

738
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,590
Oh, golly! How clever.
What do you teach?

739
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,390
The usual things. Writing.
Mathematics.

740
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,030
Crikey. Writing's almost beyond me,
and I wouldn't know where to start
with mathematics!

741
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,280
Well, then, you must marry someone
rich enough to ensure you never need
to.

742
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,590
-Oh...
-What are you doing here?

743
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,430
-Lady Rose invited me.
-Rose, did you ask Lord Grantham?

744
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Wasn't Cora's permission enough?

745
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,950
-How are you?
-I'm exhausted.

746
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,190
Two parties in one day
is too much for me.

747
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,760
-Was your luncheon a success?
-You must ask Cousin Isobel.

748
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,150
We've cast the net wide tonight.

749
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,750
-Can't Tom have a friend of his own?
-Oh, of course.

750
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,470
But it's time he decided whether he
is fish, flesh, fowl or good red
herring.

751
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,640
Well, I think it's nice to see
an intelligent face here.

752
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:38,070
Miss Bunting has been shocking us
with her support for the Prime
Minister.

753
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:42,190
But surely, most of the country must
support him, or he wouldn't be Prime
Minister.

754
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,870
-There is an unanswerable logic in
that. -Oh, quite.

755
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,430
There's an alliance that does not
bode well.

756
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,750
-I quite agree with you.
-Aren't you being very snobbish?

757
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,360
We're being realistic - something
your generation has such trouble
with.

758
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,310
Her chauffeur says there's nothing
wrong with the car that he could
find, so there's a mystery.

759
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,190
-See? She's here to see you.
-I don't know what she wants.

760
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,350
-Don't you? Because I do.
-It's embarrassing.

761
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,870
I have a feeling it could get a lot
more embarrassing

762
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,120
if you don't find a way to keep her
quiet.

763
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,310
Take that.

764
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,470
Marriage is a lottery, as we are
often told,

765
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,230
but I am a man who has drawn
a winning ticket.

766
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,190
I have been awarded a bumper prize:

767
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,670
beauty, brains, a heart,
a conscience, all in one.

768
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:38,710
I give you my Cora, the best
companion in the world.

769
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
-Mama.
-Lady Grantham.

770
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,080
-What a tribute.
-Indeed. If only it were true!

771
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,120
What's happened to Molesley's hair?

772
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,870
Carson, Lady Mary tells me that
you're to lead the Memorial
Committee.

773
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,950
-That is so, madam. Yes.
-You'll drive it splendidly.

774
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,150
Rose, is that friend of yours
terribly clever?

775
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,110
She's Tom's friend, not mine,
but I think so. Yes.

776
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,230
She certainly thought I was
terribly stupid.

777
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,600
Well, let's not shoot her down
for that.

778
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,390
No, thank you.

779
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,070
-Do you know that footman?
-Yes, he used to work for me.

780
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,350
It's always nice to see
a friendly face.

781
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,950
Especially a friendly, pretty face.

782
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,270
I'm not convinced these memorials
are a good idea,

783
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,550
but I suppose that's a different
issue.

784
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,670
Why not? Won't they give people
a focus for their sorrow?

785
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,990
And a reminder of the sacrifices
that were made.

786
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,190
If it were a memorial service,
then I might agree,

787
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,110
but a stone edifice on the green,

788
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,630
to remind us for ever of death and a
pointless war - what's the good of
that?

789
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,630
To say nothing of the waste of
money.

790
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,270
Forgive me, but you're talking
nonsense.

791
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,790
Forgive me, but I suppose
she's allowed an opinion.

792
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,310
-Not that opinion. Not in this house.
-I think what she means is -

793
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,750
She is here as your friend,
so of course you must defend her.

794
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,470
But was the war worth fighting?

795
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,150
What did it achieve, beyond the
Russian Revolution?

796
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,310
Millions of men dead and no more
'justice' than there was before.

797
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,550
You are wrong, both of you.

798
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,310
But we must strive to keep things
light.

799
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,790
It's a pity they didn't want you
on their Committee.

800
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,440
You put up a stout defence of
their intentions.

801
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,870
They do want His Lordship on the
Committee.

802
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,470
Forgive me, My Lord.

803
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,630
I'd have told you later, but they
held a meeting this afternoon,

804
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,950
and they would like you
as their patron.

805
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,830
Oh, how nice. I dare say that was
always their plan.

806
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,870
I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.

807
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,910
I should be glad to accept.

808
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,950
Now, if you can all put
your swords away,

809
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,470
perhaps we can finish our dinner
in a civilised manner.

810
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:55,310
But I admire it, when young people
stand up for their principles.

811
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,350
Principles are like prayers.

812
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,520
Noble, of course,
but awkward at a party.

813
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,410
James, did my eyes deceive me,

814
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,780
or did Lady Anstruther pass you
a note during dinner?

815
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,180
-Yes, Mr Carson.
-Can I see it?

816
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:22,690
He's thrown it away.
She just wanted to remind him that
he once worked for her, Mr Carson.

817
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,330
Even so, it's most irregular.

818
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:27,530
But it wasn't his fault, was it? He
could hardly slap her hand away.

819
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,380
Get that up to the drawing
room.

820
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:36,050
I gather from Mr Molesley that you
gave the good news to His Lordship.

821
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,330
-Ah, that is correct.
-How did you get them to agree?

822
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,930
I said I wouldn't serve if they
didn't make him Patron.

823
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,610
And have you told him that?

824
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,290
He doesn't need to know everything,
Mrs Hughes.

825
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,580
Nobody has to know everything.

826
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,650
I've enjoyed myself.

827
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,330
Both gatherings were interesting,
in their different ways.

828
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,290
You get on well with Lord Merton.
I know that.

829
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,370
I do, but Cousin Violet had other
plans for him at luncheon.

830
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,850
Where is Granny?

831
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,930
She said goodbye to your mother, but
she wanted to slip away.

832
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,770
The day of parties had taken
its toll.

833
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,690
Before I go, I want to meet the
staff downstairs.

834
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,090
You don't think you've made enough
of a statement?

835
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,610
-What about you?
-I know. I got a bit carried away.

836
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,570
-I thought you were splendid.
-Cheer up.

837
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,970
You're putting quite a dampener on
the evening.

838
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,660
Really? I thought only imbeciles
were happy all the time.

839
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,570
Here she comes.
The Boudicca of the North Riding.

840
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,530
Thank you so much for having me.

841
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,340
It was a pleasure.
Wasn't it, Robert?

842
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,170
I want to thank your cook before I
go, and the other servants.

843
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:45,050
I'm afraid they'll be sitting down to
supper, and we don't like to disturb
them.

844
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,450
-I won't be more than a minute.
-Of course you must go down.

845
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
They'd be delighted.

846
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,530
I assume you heard the way she spoke
to me at dinner.

847
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,540
Of course, but how does it help to
answer rudeness with rudeness?

848
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:04,730
-Is everything satisfactory, m'lord?
-No, it is not.

849
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,460
And can you please keep Molesley in
the kitchens until his hair stops
turning blue?

850
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,650
What are you doing?

851
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,690
Setting out the breakfast trays for
Her Ladyship and Lady Mary.

852
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,690
Not Lady Rose and Lady Edith?

853
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,780
-Unmarried young ladies eat breakfast
in the dining room. -Oh, do they?

854
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,570
Thank you again, and I'm glad to
meet you.

855
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,810
I felt I had to put faces to
his stories.

856
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,570
-What stories are those?
-Oh, that's a dangerous question.

857
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,290
We may not like the answer!

858
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,250
-Do you work in the school?
-I teach mathematics, handwriting
and spelling, mainly.

859
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,610
-You must be so clever.
-I wouldn't say that.

860
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,060
-Come and meet the others.
-Goodbye.

861
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,530
-That's such a different path.
-It is,

862
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,860
but it doesn't mean it's better than
the one you've chosen.

863
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,380
Your Ladyship, might I have a word?

864
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,370
I'm very sorry to say it,

865
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,290
but I've learned something that
makes me feel both responsible and
guilty.

866
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,340
Would this have to do with Baxter?

867
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,410
Because, if it concerns her criminal
record, then I know all about it.

868
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,330
Do you, m'lady?

869
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,370
What I don't understand is why you
placed a convicted felon

870
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,450
in my household, in my bedroom,

871
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,970
when you knew every detail
of her past.

872
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,570
I wanted her to have another chance.

873
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,970
Don't you think that should have
been my decision, in my own house?

874
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,770
Yes, m'lady. Perhaps it should.

875
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:35,570
So...why tell me now?
Because, if you have been using your
knowledge against her,

876
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,730
I'll have to consider your future
here.

877
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,780
Indeed, whether you have one at all.

878
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:43,450
I just thought I'd been wrong and
you ought to know.

879
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,500
I see. Well, now I do.

880
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,940
Good night.

881
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,020
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

882
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,260
Has Miss Bunting gone?

883
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,810
Yes. She got a lift down to the
village with Mrs Crawley.

884
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,860
That was nice of her.

885
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,530
I wanted to apologise, for arguing
with you at dinner.

886
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,850
You were nothing, compared to her.

887
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,810
She has her views - that's true.

888
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,610
But I must confess, they remind me
of how I used to feel.

889
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,690
Is that what you want, Tom?
To go back, when you've come so far?

890
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:33,930
I've come a long way from who I was.
That's true.

891
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,980
And is it a bad thing?

892
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,890
-We're not lovers, you know.
-What?

893
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,730
That time when you were in London,

894
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,860
you thought that we'd got up to
something. We never did.

895
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,730
As Sybil's father, this is not an
easy conversation for me,

896
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,700
but if I was wrong, then I am sorry.

897
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,610
The truth is, I worry less about that

898
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:06,780
than if Miss Bunting is taking you
back into the role of rebel and
hater.

899
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,730
I'm not a hater.

900
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,780
I don't hate anyone.

901
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Least of all you.

902
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,020
Well, that is a more cheerful note to
say 'good night' on.

903
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,340
Isis!

904
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,940
But why didn't you give the jewels
back?

905
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,930
You say you didn't have them by
then, but who did?

906
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,810
More than that,
why did you do it at all?

907
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:40,250
You don't strike me as being greedy.
You were working. You were earning.

908
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,410
Did you dislike Mrs Benton?
Was she harsh?

909
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,410
-No, m'lady. She was a kind woman.
-That only makes it more mysterious.

910
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,610
I won't start concocting excuses for
myself. There are no excuses.

911
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,980
There may not be excuses, but there
is missing information.

912
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,060
You've shocked me, Baxter.
Profoundly. I can't deny it.

913
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:06,180
You have every reason, m'lady. So, am
I to take it that I am dismissed?

914
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,930
Your work is excellent, and I have
never sacked a servant

915
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,180
that gave me no cause for complaint.

916
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,170
Have I your word you will not commit
this crime again?

917
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,260
I will never commit any crime again.
Not as long as I live.

918
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,010
You may stay until I make
a decision.

919
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,530
I cannot tell you how long
that will be,

920
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,370
and I do not at all promise
I'll keep you on.

921
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,970
No.

922
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,020
Very well.

923
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,620
I think we should leave it there
for now.

924
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,490
I hope we don't have to see too much
more of Miss Bunting.

925
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,730
Lady Rose told Madge she liked her.

926
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,970
And she seemed nice when she came
downstairs.

927
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:02,130
Maybe, but she makes Papa say things
he doesn't mean,

928
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:04,780
and I know he hates himself for it
afterwards.

929
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,660
Mr Molesley...

930
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,210
I do not know why you have treated
your hair with a special substance -

931
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,930
-Well, I -
-But I can only say

932
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,130
that the effect on your appearance
is not what you would have it.

933
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,970
Take steps, Mr Molesley. Take steps.

934
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,300
You will remain below stairs
until you do.

935
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,740
Well... So, Lady Mary's not quite so
ladylike, after all.

936
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,340
Me next.

937
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:52,130
-You think I'm mad, don't you?
-It doesn't matter what I think.

938
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:55,570
-Maybe she just wants to talk.
-Maybe I'm the missing Tsarevich (!)

939
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:59,010
The trouble is, I can't resist it.
Not when it's offered on a plate.

940
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,850
Well, you're not alone there.

941
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,850
Now, if you can stay with her
until three,

942
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,410
you'll get back to your room
without being noticed.

943
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:10,340
I'll watch until you're in there.
If you hear me speak, just keep
walking past her door.

944
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,570
Thanks, Mr Barrow.

945
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,620
Thomas. I mean it.

946
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,570
You're a real pal.

947
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:21,620
Well, I try to be.

948
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,770
But, Tony...you really shouldn't be
in here.

949
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,930
-Of course I shouldn't.
-Why are you, then?

950
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,890
-Because you're in love with me.
-Am I?

951
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,010
Well, you said so yourself. You were
torn between me and Charles Blake,

952
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,820
but I think you've decided
and I'm the winner.

953
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:52,860
Well, thank goodness that's settled.

954
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:56,740
The trouble is, you want to be sure.

955
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,650
Well, surer than the customs
of well-bred courtship will allow.

956
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,490
-Go on.
-I want you to come away.

957
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:07,170
Just for a week, maybe less.

958
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,620
But on our own, and we'll spend
the days...talking.

959
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,290
And the nights?

960
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,340
We'll spend those together, too.

961
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,220
I want us to be lovers, Mary.

962
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:27,860
I want us to know everything there
is to know about each other.

963
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,580
And then after that, I believe you
will be sure.

964
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,170
If Papa was here,
he'd hit you on the nose.

965
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,130
I'm trying to convince you
to marry me.

966
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,490
That's not the normal purpose of
seducers.

967
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,540
I don't think he'd see it that way.

968
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,980
What do you say to my scandalous
suggestion?

969
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,300
No-one must ever find out.

970
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,610
-Fire!
-What?

971
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,900
-Fire!
-Oh, my God. George!

972
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,300
I've got Sybbie and George.

973
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,770
Thank God! Mary, you take them.

974
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,130
Tony, go with her. Tom, come with me.

975
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,460
You know where the sand buckets
are kept.

976
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,170
Good god! Barrow, is she all right?

977
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,980
-I think so, m'lord.
-We must get her outside.

978
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,340
Quickly, Tom!

979
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:53,730
Tom, get the hose!

980
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,450
Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.
She'll do the rest.

981
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,850
We must alert the firemen. Who knows
where to find Drewe's number?

982
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,570
-I do.
-And save the dog!

983
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,130
Barrow, hurry up! Get her away from
the smoke. I'll check the bedrooms.

984
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,820
-Let me check the rooms, m'lord.
-Now, man!

985
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
Fire!

986
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,610
There's a fire.

987
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,020
Well, I'll see you both downstairs.

988
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:27,290
Everybody outside. There's a fire.

989
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:30,730
James? James? Where's James?

990
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,850
Peter, look in the bathroom
for James.

991
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,890
Mr Molesley, hurry along, please.

992
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,980
Here, Tom!

993
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,300
Mrs Patmore, do be careful.

994
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,540
Don't worry. Don't worry.

995
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,060
We'll take over now, m'lord.

996
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,780
Thank you.

997
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,130
-How are you feeling?
-All right, I think.

998
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,970
But I've been terribly stupid.

999
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,020
Don't worry about that now.

1000
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,890
Lord Grantham, I may sneak away
before breakfast.

1001
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:28,090
Would you forgive me?
I have quite a way to go.

1002
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,010
Perhaps that would be a good idea.

1003
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,060
M'lord...

1004
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,210
Barrow, we have to thank you -

1005
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,420
for raising the alarm and rescuing
Lady Edith so bravely.

1006
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,730
What were you doing on the gallery?

1007
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:47,330
-Oh, just keeping an eye on things.
-Well, thank goodness you were!

1008
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:51,010
I was angry with you before and
I was tempted to take it further,

1009
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,010
but I accept that you have earned
our goodwill by your actions
tonight.

1010
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,060
Thank you, m'lady.

1011
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:05,370
What's going on? What's happening?

1012
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,170
Don't worry. It's almost over.

1013
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,210
Mr Bates wanted to come, to see you
were safe. We were so worried.

1014
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:14,730
We're fine. Lady Edith chose to set
fire to her room, but we're fine.

1015
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,860
I'll see if there's anything
I can do.

1016
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,900
He's calmed down now, but he was in
a real state.

1017
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,850
He does get so worked up about
things.

1018
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
I can imagine.

1019
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,090
I don't wish to be harsh,
but I have a feeling

1020
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,530
James would be better
employed elsewhere.

1021
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:37,050
-Oh?
-Please don't ask me why I think so,

1022
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,090
but I suspect his ambitions rather
outstrip what a career as a footman
will yield.

1023
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:43,610
-As Your Lordship wishes.
-Give him a good reference.

1024
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,410
We don't want it talked about.

1025
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,410
Understood, m'lord.

1026
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:50,650
All clear now, m'lord. No real
damage beyond Lady Edith's bedroom.

1027
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
Well, that's something.

1028
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,610
We can all go back inside!

1029
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,660
The excitement is over.

1030
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,890
Might Lady Edith sleep in His
Lordship's dressing room tonight,
m'lady?

1031
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,450
Since the bed's made up.

1032
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,730
Of course.

1033
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:11,500
-I'm just going to thank the firemen,
Papa. -Right.

1034
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,610
-Have you had any ideas?
-Yes, and it's a simple one.

1035
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,850
You are going to take a great
interest in little Marigold, m'lady.

1036
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,850
-Of course. -We just need to introduce
the notion carefully,

1037
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,980
so everyone accepts and believes it.

1038
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,810
You're to sleep in His Lordship's
dressing room tonight,

1039
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,250
and we'll see what can be saved
tomorrow.

1040
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,300
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

1041
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:00,210
You have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

1042
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,570
I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

1043
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:04,770
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe figure of Tony Gillingham?

1044
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,490
-You do know she's a thief?
-There must be more to it.

1045
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,730
Mrs Crawley has been distracted
lately,

1046
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,130
with Lord Merton frisking around
her skirts.

1047
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,260
-I didn't kill him personally.
-I didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

1048
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,660
Is this what they call a lively
exchange of views?

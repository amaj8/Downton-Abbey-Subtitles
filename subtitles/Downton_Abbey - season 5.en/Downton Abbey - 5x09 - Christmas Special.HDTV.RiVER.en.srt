1
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,110
Come on. Move along. This way.
Downstairs.

2
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,110
I hope everything will be resolved
while we're away.

3
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,790
How is she?

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,550
It breaks my heart to see her in
that place, but she is strong.

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,230
Ah, Barrow.

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,630
It's good of you to take this on.
Isn't it, Bates?

7
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,550
It's good of you to allow it,
m'Lord.

8
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,510
Lord Sinderby has rented Brancaster
Castle for the grouse.

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,550
The house is extremely grand
and knowing Lord Sinderby

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,630
everything will be done

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,510
~ in the most lickety-split manner.
~ I think I'm up to it, m'Lord.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,070
~ I've started packing in the dressing
room. ~ According to Lady Rose,

13
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,110
he's taken his own butler,
which I cannot think wise

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,870
as it will only cause disruption.
So you'll need to be on your toes.

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,030
The train is at 11 tomorrow morning.
Bates will pack, you should watch.

16
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,680
~ And now I think I'll leave you
to it. ~ M'Lord.

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,710
Miss Baxter, I'll help you pack.
You've a lot on your plate.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,310
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.
I could do with a hand.

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,390
But I've talked with Lady Mary
and Lady Edith.

20
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,430
It's hard to cope with three ladies
at once,

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,070
what with tweeds, evening dresses,
tea gowns and all.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,430
Tea gowns?! We're not in the 1890s
now, Mr Molesley.

23
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
More's the pity.

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,190
Did she take a cake with a file
in it?

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,670
I don't know why you're making such
a fuss.

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,630
You'd visit Denker if she were
locked up.

27
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,350
Only to check if the locks were
sound.

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,430
Bates was found innocent, no
doubt Anna will be, too.

29
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,390
Lord knows they don't deserve their
luck, those two.

30
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,510
I heard from Rosamund - she says
she's going to try to get to the sale

31
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,310
~ of the della Francesca.
~ I'm glad we'll be represented.

32
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,910
~ Pity it clashed with your trip, or
you could have gone. ~ I don't mind.

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,270
I've said goodbye. If you will
excuse me, I must dash off.

34
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,430
~ I'm expected in York at 3:00.
~ You should have gone with Mary.

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,510
~ You could have given her lunch.
~ I didn't want to kick my heels

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,590
before my appointment.

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,990
Do you have any plans
for when we're away?

38
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,270
Shrimpie's men have found Princess
Kuragin.

39
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,910
~ When she arrives in England,
she's coming straight to me. ~ What?

40
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,910
~ When did you hear?
~ Yesterday.

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,870
We've got her out and brought her
to safety.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,030
~ You must be looking forward
to seeing her again. ~ Hardly.

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,270
If you don't like her, why have you
sent Shrimpie to her rescue?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,030
That's what I keep asking.

45
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
~ Well, Granny?
~ Oh, you know me.

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,430
Never complain.

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,950
Never explain.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,800
You don't usually have much trouble
complaining.

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,150
(Did you give a false name?)

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,470
Certainly not.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,190
(But suppose it comes out in the
papers you came to see me.)

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,600
It will show that the Crawleys do
not believe you did it.

53
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,990
Yes, but...

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,150
who knows what they'll come up with
before they're done?

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,430
~ What do you mean?
~ I've been here before with Mr Bates.

56
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,470
They weave their web with little lies
and innuendo

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,550
~ until they hold you fast.
~ Anna.

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,710
All they have is one man who thinks
he saw you.

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,390
That's not enough.

60
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,950
Any character witness could prove it
isn't in your nature.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,360
And you know we would all testify to
that if it comes to it.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,830
(I assume you know about Lady Mary's
visit this morning?)

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,830
~ I do.
~ (I don't like it.)

64
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,790
(Suppose it gets into the papers.)

65
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,630
'Earl's loyal daughter visits maid in
prison.'

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,390
I should think the public would like
her for it.

67
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,430
Whether they do or not, I hate to
give them the chance

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040
to poke their grubby noses into our
business.

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,670
What on earth's going on here?
Shouldn't you be in the gun room?

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,070
Mr Jackson's got the underkeeper
with him.

71
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,310
~ I didn't want to be in their way.
~ You're in OUR way.

72
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,750
It won't take long. I'm glad of
the chance to check it's in shape

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,830
~ before they go.
~ I don't need checking.

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,590
I'm to load for His Lordship,
which you never can.

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,470
Mr Barrow's father was
a shooting man.

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,040
Killing sparrows by the gasworks is
not the same as shooting grouse
at Brancaster Castle!

77
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,470
~ Must have been hard to miss your
visit. ~ Lady Mary wanted to go.

78
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,270
They allow one visitor at a time,
unless there's a special reason.

79
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,590
It may help for them to see the
family thinks her innocent.

80
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,430
The sacrifice could be worth it.

81
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,430
I'd cut my arm off if I thought it
would do any good.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,750
I don't think that'd be sensible. We
can't have you wobbly at both ends.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,910
They didn't finish this,
and they're away tomorrow,

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,710
so I thought we might.

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,080
~ It's a favourite of mine.
~ Mmm, it's very nice.

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,760
You won't go far wrong
with a Margaux.

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Mmm!

88
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,190
These four are real contenders.

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,150
Three good-size bedrooms, bathroom
already installed

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,630
~ and a room off the kitchen for
a maid. ~ Mm.

91
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,990
Where's the butler's pantry?

92
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,030
If we're offering bed and breakfast,

93
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,710
~ there should be someone there to run
it. ~ Oh, I don't know.

94
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,120
We should go and look at them,
and then we'll talk.

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,510
Is it worth speaking to Murray again
before we go?

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,950
Why can't he get her out?

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,670
He says they've uncovered something,
but they won't tell him what.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,910
What did Susan have to say for
herself?

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,630
She's furious we've been invited and
she hasn't.

100
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,230
~ How did she find out? ~ I told her.
I didn't want her to hear it
from someone else.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,110
The divorce would be a big thing
for Lord Sinderby to get over.

102
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,950
~ Cars are ready, M'Lord.
~ Thank you. We're just coming.

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,830
What's the matter? What were you
doing at York? I wish you'd tell me.

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,510
Nothing worth bothering about.
Are we all here?

105
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,390
Where are the children? Nanny said
she'd bring them to say goodbye.

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,670
They'll be outside.

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,390
George, come to Mummy.

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,560
You, too, Marigold, come to...

109
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,400
~ .. me. Come on, darling.
~ Bye, bye, Daddy.

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,190
Did you see that? Edith wanted to
say, 'Come to Mummy,'

111
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,310
but she stopped herself just in
time.

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,470
~ Still sure I shouldn't have it out
with her? ~ Quite sure.

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,080
It's not our secret.

114
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,510
Check every piece of luggage
when they're transferred in York.

115
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,750
I have changed trains before,
Mr Carson.

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,630
I'm impressed you should come
to say goodbye, Mama.

117
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,550
Why do you always talk of me
as if I were a salmon

118
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,150
who laid my eggs in the gravel
then swam back to the sea?

119
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,110
You're very maternal, Granny,
if it suits you.

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,790
~ When does Princess Kuragin turn up?
~ Tomorrow.

121
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,670
~ What about the prince? ~ He'll be
coming to dinner that night.

122
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,630
~ Will you be there?
~ Would I miss it?

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,510
I can't tell you how sorry
I am that we will.

124
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,920
Get aboard before I get cross
with you.

125
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,070
All aboard!

126
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,910
It's all in your hands, Carson.

127
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,560
May they prove worthy of the charge,
my Lord.

128
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,070
Lord Sinderby, Branson and Barrow -

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,110
not what I'd call a recipe for a
peaceful week's shooting.

130
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,190
Makes you wonder what they'll be
shooting at, by the end of it.

131
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,550
So, Daisy, what are you working at
while they're away?

132
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,510
~ I haven't decided yet.
~ You don't sound very keen.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,910
To be honest, sometimes I'm not sure
I should go on with it.

134
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,870
I mean, what am I trying to prove?

135
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,550
~ We're not having another crisis,
are we? ~ No.

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,270
But the more I think about it,

137
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,830
the more I wonder how realistic are
my plans.

138
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,270
Wouldn't it make more sense now to
get on with my life?

139
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,590
Mrs Patmore, what are you doing in
here?

140
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,510
Oh, I came up for a bit of air.

141
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,760
It's nice to get your head above
ground for five minutes.

142
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,870
~ For Rose's sake, we must all be on
our best behaviour. ~ I agree.

143
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,910
Sinderby always looks as if he's
spoiling for a fight,

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,350
whether he is or not.

145
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,310
We must be careful not to give him
grounds for one.

146
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,150
I wonder if I was right to come.

147
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,310
I don't want to sound like Larry
Grey,

148
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,190
but I'm not Lord Sinderby's idea of
a perfect son-in-law.

149
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,550
Stuff and nonsense! We Crawleys
stick together.

150
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,750
For once I agree with Mary. You'll
enjoy it when we get there.

151
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,350
Besides, you're a good shot.

152
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Any host will forgive a lot if
you get the numbers up.

153
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,670
~ What is it? Can I do anything to
help? ~ Yes, stop fussing.

154
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,470
I suggested to Nanny she take the
children to Lake Gormire for a
picnic.

155
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,230
Do you think it too dangerous?
Shall I telephone to cancel it?

156
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,790
~ Why don't you shut them up in a box
in the attic, let them out when
they're 21? ~ Don't be unkind!

157
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,080
Honestly, I'm the mother round here
and I'm not panicking.

158
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,960
(Hmm.)

159
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,550
~ So, everything's under control?
~ I'd say so, m'Lord.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,120
The housekeeper has drawn up the
list of rooms.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,590
How do you find the servants
generally? Are they co-operative?

162
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,070
They'd rather be taking orders from
their own butler.

163
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,070
I'd rather be giving them to mine.

164
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,750
Lord Hexham didn't seem to think it
would be a problem.

165
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,280
Nor is it, m'Lord.

166
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,830
Do you really want tea in the
library, m'Lady?

167
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,750
Apparently tea is normally served in
the ante-library here.

168
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,280
How interesting, Stowell. But we
will have it in the library.

169
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,520
~ Why must he always know better?
~ Because he always knows better.

170
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,320
~ Oh! It's too thrilling you could
come. ~ Welcome.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,470
Cora!

172
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,990
~ How was Venice?
~ Wonderful. Sublime.

173
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,670
There was water all over the
streets!

174
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,910
~ What a marvellous place this is.
~ Do you know it?

175
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,110
I came here once when I was young
in old Lord Hexham's day.

176
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,990
~ They were trying to unload a niece.
~ The new one's not much here,

177
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,550
~ which is why they let out the
shooting. ~ Luckily for us!

178
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,110
~ Welcome to Brancaster!
~ I hope you had a decent journey.

179
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,870
This is Stowell, whom we brought
with us. He'll be running it all.

180
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,590
Quite a challenge for you.

181
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,430
We're not a very big party, we'll
be quite cosy.

182
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,350
We know some locals, which is one of
the reasons we took it.

183
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,350
And Lord Hexham has asked us to be
kind to his late father's pals.

184
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,510
That seems steep given what Lord
Sinderby must be in for.

185
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,630
~ Can't we use Christian names?
~ My name is not a Christian name.

186
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,760
~ You know what I mean.
~ Shall we go through?

187
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,550
Right, off you go. Quick as you can.

188
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,110
May I introduce myself?

189
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,230
I am Mr Barrow, valet to the Earl of
Grantham.

190
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,350
I believe you are TEMPORARY valet to
Lord Grantham.

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,830
The sad story of Mrs Bates has
reached our ears.

192
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,310
~ News travels fast.
~ I'm Lord Sinderby's butler, Stowell.

193
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,200
~ Oh, so you're a novice here, too.
~ I am not a novice anywhere.

194
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,710
Those are for Mr Branson.

195
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,550
~ He's up here without a valet.
~ Few chauffeurs travel with a valet.

196
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,790
Heavens, you are up-to-date with
your detail, Mr Stowell.

197
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,950
How can you bear to wait on him?

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,990
We do what we have to do, don't we?

199
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,750
On which subject, you will help out
as a footman while you're here.

200
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,830
~ Excuse, I am an under-butler and -
~ Lord Hexham is seldom at home,

201
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,670
and so they do not maintain a
full staff.

202
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,750
You will serve as a footman.

203
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,830
Don't worry, we'll find you a livery.

204
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,030
Are the rooms of Lady Grantham,
Lady Mary and Lady Edith close by?

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,830
~ I'm maiding all of them. ~ Then you'll
be sturdy by the time you get home.

206
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,750
What does Mr Branson do when the
others are shooting?

207
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,390
~ Pick up, or read motor magazines?
~ In fact, he's a very good shot.

208
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,110
Is he, indeed? I suppose that was his
training with the Fenians.

209
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,960
Well, I'm sorry if we're not up to
your standards, Mr Stowell.

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,230
She'll arrive about six and come
straight here.

211
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,310
That'll give her time to change.

212
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,030
~ I doubt she has much to change into.
~ Yes, well, I'll see to that.

213
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,390
~ And the prince?
~ I've asked him for dinner at eight.

214
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,710
You'll be there a few minutes before.

215
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,950
~ Suppose he brings his toothbrush?
~ Well, let him stay.

216
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,390
I mean, they're well and truly
married.

217
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,110
God knows I can swear to that.

218
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,230
And I've asked Lord Merton.

219
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,590
Yes, he can talk to the princess.

220
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,910
You know, they can discuss...
syringes and stitches and things.

221
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,480
Ooh, what fun you make it sound (!)

222
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,750
We're not a large party.

223
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,910
Atticus has a friend, Charlie Rogers.
He's about an hour away,

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,910
he's coming on Thursday.

225
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,390
And we've got the agent, Mr Pelham,
coming.

226
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,560
You should invite Shrimpie -
he's a marvellous shot.

227
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,110
I gather you've asked a few of Lord
Hexham's friends. Very good of you.

228
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,510
I suspect some of them have had to
overcome their principles

229
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,670
~ to accept my hospitality.
~ The English have strong principles

230
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,870
except when it comes to the chance
of good shooting or eating well.

231
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,190
How true!

232
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,310
You.

233
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
Milk.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,400
I was wondering if I might have
some sug...

235
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,310
How rude!

236
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,070
I'm afraid Stowell's a snob.

237
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,510
He'll have found out about Tom's
background

238
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,120
~ and now he's punishing him for it.
~ Well, we can't allow that.

239
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,510
I don't think I've noticed that
before.

240
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,790
My mother's maid gave it to me as a
wedding present.

241
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,750
When I was a girl, if I was ill,

242
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,430
she would make the most delicious
chicken broth and serve it in this.

243
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,750
There's nothing better than chicken
broth as a pick-me-up.

244
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,550
No, and it really was delicious.
I remember it to this day.

245
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,310
She used to say,
'Every good lady's maid

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,270
should know how to make a restorative
broth.'

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,710
~ Those days are gone, I'm afraid.
~ Quite gone. Eh, Miss Denker?

248
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm not sure I'd agree.

249
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,190
Spratt! You mustn't be jealous when
Denker is saying she can cook.

250
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,910
I was not so much jealous as
dubious, my lady.

251
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,910
You'll have to prove him wrong
one day, Denker.

252
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,710
Yes, prove me wrong and make us all
a delicious broth.

253
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,510
Well, we'll see.

254
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,520
That's right. Seeing is believing,
eh, Miss Denker?

255
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,390
I'm sorry, I thought it was settled
we'd go tomorrow.

256
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,310
We can if we must, but I don't see
why we're in such a hurry.

257
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,870
I'll be off first thing, if that's
all right, Mr Carson.

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,430
I'd love to give you something to
take for her,

259
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,590
~ but they wouldn't let her keep it.
~ Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

260
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,720
But it's knowing we're thinking of
her, that's what counts.

261
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,830
Poor Mr Bates. What a nightmare he
must be living through.

262
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,200
~ At least they let him visit a lot.
~ Only until she's convicted.

263
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,510
The wagons are outside.

264
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,990
You better get moving.

265
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,910
~ Oh, give anything you need to your
loader. ~ Yes.

266
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
We'll see them in the butts.

267
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,750
~ Absolutely.
~ So, if you'd like -

268
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,110
~ Rachel.
~ Yes?

269
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,750
~ Are you with me? ~ No, I think I'll
chum Tom for this drive.

270
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,560
~ Mary can keep you company.
~ As you wish.

271
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,310
I'm afraid your father's rather
disappointed

272
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,870
that I'm not inclined to welcome
your cousin Shrimpie under my roof.

273
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,640
Papa only said he was a good shot,
and he is.

274
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,550
Lord Sinderby, now that we're
family,

275
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,430
wouldn't it be better just to accept
the situation of Rose's parents?

276
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,070
Wouldn't it make it pleasanter for
everyone?

277
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,520
I can't pretend to approve of
divorce.

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,150
Even for you.

279
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,440
And you can't learn to live with it,
even for Rose's sake?

280
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,710
Did you shoot as a boy?

281
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,150
I used to shoot pigeons on my
grandfather's farm.

282
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,190
Pigeons - how very difficult!

283
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,560
Thank you.

284
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
Was it hard, joining their family?

285
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,190
Hard enough.

286
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
Sybil was dead, and I had to do it
on my own.

287
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
They seem much more welcoming than
we are.

288
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,910
I was still a shock to the system.

289
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,120
Daniel Sinderby is a prig.

290
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,310
I suppose Rachel just wants us all
to be friends.

291
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,960
In her husband's case, she has such
poor material to work with.

292
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,150
~ Robert.
~ What is it?

293
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,350
~ Where did you go in York?
~ Ah, here they come!

294
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Excellent!

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,230
They haven't got a case.

296
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,710
Yes, you were in London, but so were
seven million other people.

297
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,400
You're not listening.

298
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,550
They've found something out.
About me.

299
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,470
That's nonsense. It can't be
anything that matters.

300
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,880
I should have told you.

301
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,720
And I feel badly about it now.

302
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,310
You know my father was a labourer.

303
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,710
~ He was killed in an accident at
work. ~ Yes.

304
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,870
When I was about six. Me, my sister
and mother were left destitute.

305
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,350
Until she married again, and your
stepfather was an ironworker.

306
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,280
~ I know all this.
~ Not all of it.

307
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
It wasn't much at first.

308
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,720
Slight touches.

309
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,350
Brushing past me.

310
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,480
I still remember the smell of the
beer on his breath.

311
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Couldn't you tell your mother?

312
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,150
She didn't want to believe it.

313
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
What would she have done
if he'd left?

314
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,390
Then, one night, he kept looking at
me and I knew what was coming.

315
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,630
So I fetched a knife from the
scullery and I waited in the dark.

316
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,000
~ Are you saying you killed him?
~ No. No, of course not.

317
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,070
I threatened him.

318
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,830
And when he wouldn't stop, I...

319
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,670
I struck him with the blade, but I
only cut him.

320
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,680
~ You mean, nothing happened?
~ Well...

321
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,070
.. he screamed blue murder,
so the Watch came.

322
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,630
But my mother persuaded him

323
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,960
to say he slipped and fell,
that it was an accident.

324
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,680
After that, I took a job further up
north as a tweeny.

325
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,030
But it must have been in the records
and now they've found it.

326
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,030
Either that, or he heard I was in
prison and told them.

327
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,200
You're not guilty.

328
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,400
So there must be a way to prove it.

329
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,200
Do you never doubt?

330
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,160
I once asked you that question.

331
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,640
And my answer was the same as yours.

332
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,480
I don't doubt.

333
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,760
And I don't doubt that the sun
will rise in the east, either.

334
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,320
Thank you.

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,310
~ I wonder what the children are
doing. ~ Not worrying about us.

336
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,750
You're right, of course.

337
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,160
~ I'm sure they're being spoiled to
death. ~ Of course they are.

338
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,840
Might I have some bread?

339
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,150
Thank you, Stowell. You're very
kind.

340
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,000
(I do apologise.)

341
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,590
Poor Atticus. How can he reprimand
his father's butler?

342
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,030
Lord Sinderby wouldn't take kindly to
that.

343
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,710
The silly thing is, I don't think
Stowell likes my father-in-law.

344
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,750
~ He seems obsequious enough. ~ Oh, he's
all bows and deference to his face,

345
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,150
but my maid tells me it's a
different story behind his back.

346
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,550
That's a frightening thought, when
you remember what a butler knows
about the family he serves.

347
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,160
They know far more about us
than we do about them.

348
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,870
Well, it's nice, but it would take
a lot to get it up to a standard

349
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,190
~ where we could charge money
to stay there. ~ Oh, not so much.

350
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,710
We'd employ the estate workers
and I'd supervise.

351
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,630
While I'd be supervising the mythical
'maid of all work'.

352
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,230
We'd SHARE the duties.
That's the whole point.

353
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,200
All right. Where's the next one?

354
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,350
We take the bus to Helmsley

355
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,310
and then it's a bit of a hike.

356
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,680
Keep calm. I'm not dead yet!

357
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,110
It was kind of you to send
a motor car.

358
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,670
We didn't want you to get lost.

359
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,830
~ Where is the princess?
~ She's upstairs changing.

360
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,560
We haven't seen her yet, any of us.

361
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,190
I borrow this from the Theatre
Royale.

362
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,390
Oh!

363
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,560
Well, shall we...?

364
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,150
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
greet her in a room by yourself?

365
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,470
~ We can always scoot back.
~ No, no.

366
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,200
It will be easier not to be alone
at first.

367
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,680
I haven't seen her for five years.

368
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,230
I want you all here.

369
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,360
The presence of strangers is our only
guarantee of good behaviour.

370
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,670
I hate the way Stowell treats
Mr Branson.

371
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,230
He isn't polite downstairs.

372
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,230
He doesn't approve of Mr Branson's
bettering himself.

373
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,760
What right has he to approve
or disapprove?

374
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,510
Anyway, Lady Rose says he doesn't
even like Lord Sinderby.

375
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,110
~ I'm not sure His Lordship's very
easy to like. ~ True enough.

376
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,110
But is there any way to get Stowell
a black mark?

377
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,550
~ Can't Barrow come up with something?
~ Er...

378
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,790
You're right, Mr Barrow usually has
a card or two up his sleeve.

379
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,830
Well, tell him to get one out of his
sleeve and play it. Pronto.

380
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,270
~ I don't mind taking him down a peg
or two. ~ But how?

381
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,320
Mm.

382
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,350
Let me think about it
while I'm cleaning these.

383
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,750
~ That reminds me - have you seen Lord
Sinderby's valet? ~ Why?

384
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,190
Ran out of waterproofing wax.

385
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,070
Excuse me. Do you know where I can
find Lord Sinderby's valet?

386
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,600
~ Mr Daunt? He's gone out. He won't be
back before ten. ~ Thank you.

387
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,830
I think I've got an idea.

388
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,110
Do you think Lard Mary would mind
annoying Lord Sinderby?

389
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,710
~ None of our lot would mind.
~ Will you help me?

390
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,950
I suppose so, seeing as it's what
Lady Mary's asked for.

391
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,750
~ Then there's your answer.
~ I don't understand.

392
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,670
You will. We need a piece of paper
and a pencil.

393
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,000
Come with me.

394
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,720
The Princess Kuragin.

395
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,320
~ Igor.
~ Irina.

396
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,950
Shall I introduce everyone?

397
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,230
If you wish. But what difference
will it make?

398
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,800
~ Uh... Y-You've had a long journey,
Princess. ~ Obviously.

399
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,320
I would so like to go to Russia.

400
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,150
I'm afraid I never have.

401
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,680
Then you've missed it.

402
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,670
~ Do you have everything you need?
~ I wear the clothes you had put out.

403
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,550
~ I didn't know if you'd have your
luggage with you. ~ I have no luggage.

404
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,510
~ I have no possessions to put in my
luggage. ~ Come, my dear.

405
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,270
Nothing is more tedious than other
people's misfortunes.

406
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,470
~ Let us just be grateful
to Lady Grantham. ~ Hm!

407
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,200
Last time we met, the circumstances
were rather different.

408
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,360
~ I don't remember.
~ I think you do.

409
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,550
Ah! There's a note here for
a Mrs Brennan. Who's that?

410
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,110
~ The cook. Why? ~ As I say,
somebody's left a note for her.

411
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,040
So you better take it in.

412
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,950
How can you be sure they won't trace
it back to us?

413
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
I'm not a complete amateur, Miss
Baxter. Give me some credit.

414
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,830
It's rather a nuisance, but Charlie
Rogers has rung to say

415
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,670
he's got a friend staying, so he's
got to bring him or chuck.

416
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,670
~ What will you do? ~ I've said to bring
him, but it means I can't shoot.

417
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,870
~ How infuriating. Who is he?
~ He's called Henry Talbot.

418
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,990
~ I don't know anything about him.
~ I'll tell the agent not to come.

419
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,550
Oh, no. Poor Mr Pelham, that's too
unkind.

420
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,280
~ I don't know why, but we all feel
a bit sorry for him. ~ Oh.

421
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,630
Oh, this is very nice, Mrs Patmore.
Quite a treat.

422
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,510
Well, the cat's away, so we mice
might as well play a little.

423
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,350
~ Who have you invited?
~ Oh, just us,

424
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,150
Mr Bates, Mr Molesley and Daisy.

425
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,230
Daisy? To wait on us, I assume?

426
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,110
To wait on us and eat with us.

427
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,030
If that thought's too democratically
overpowering,

428
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,790
you can share what I've made for the
housemaids.

429
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,470
It is your choice.

430
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,470
~ Is everything settled?
~ What's this?

431
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,710
Mr Murray's coming tomorrow to see
Anna

432
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,590
and he's got permission for Mr Bates
to be present.

433
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,710
I'll be gone most of the day. I hope
to speak to him afterwards.

434
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,630
Of course. Don't worry.
We'll expect you when we see you.

435
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,230
Here's Mr Molesley.
Now we can begin.

436
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,240
Hope I haven't kept you waiting!

437
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,870
I wonder whether I might have some
wine?

438
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,040
You've not had any? Stowell, what's
the matter with you?

439
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,830
What the devil's going on?

440
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,030
Rachel, can you explain this?

441
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,670
~ Explain what? ~ Why am I not being
given anything decent to eat?

442
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,150
I don't know. Stowell?

443
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,390
~ It was Your Lordship's order.
~ What are you talking about?

444
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,390
~ What is the matter with you tonight?
~ Mr Daunt left a note for the cook,

445
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,270
~ saying you'd asked -
~ I never said a thing to Daunt!

446
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,430
And why are you so rude
to Mr Branson?

447
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,190
~ There's no need - ~ The cook
told me you requested simple -

448
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,230
Stowell,
someone's played a joke on us.

449
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,710
Now, when you got the note, did it
look like Daunt's writing?

450
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,190
I never saw the note.

451
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,550
~ And obviously Mrs Brennan is not
familiar - ~ What?!

452
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,270
Do you dare to use the word
'obviously' when you contradict me?

453
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,190
Now take this away,
fetch me some dinner

454
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,990
and conduct yourself more
professionally in the future.

455
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,160
And bring that back, you stupid fool!

456
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,830
We're not shooting tomorrow, so
would you like to see the estate?

457
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,990
What fun that would be. Don't you
think so, Robert?

458
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,670
~ Goodness.
~ He does get so rattled by things.

459
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,030
I'm not very keen on your butler, so
I'm afraid I rather enjoyed it.

460
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,550
Well, maybe, but Stowell's a proud
chap.

461
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,510
He won't find that easy to forgive.

462
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,680
I don't think Barrow will much like
being called a stupid fool.

463
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,870
I think you'll enjoy Paris.

464
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,710
Oh, many of our countrymen have
settled there.

465
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:08,070
Of course, they've lost everything,
but so have we.

466
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,630
Including the will to live.

467
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,830
Well, if you're going to be
miserable,

468
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,710
you might as well do it in charming
surroundings.

469
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,390
With your permission,
I am going up now.

470
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,390
I hope you will be comfortable.

471
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,310
My maid, Denker, will be looking
after you.

472
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,310
I will be more comfortable tonight
than I will ever be again.

473
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,710
You don't know that.

474
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,550
But I do, Mrs Crawley.

475
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,760
Goodnight.

476
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,830
What time will you call for the
princess in the morning?

477
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,630
Whenever suits you. If that's what
you've decided.

478
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,040
Me?

479
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,150
I'm surprised you think there is
still a decision to be made.

480
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,510
You are good to lend her those
things.

481
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,110
They're given, not lent.

482
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,600
So...

483
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,310
.. tomorrow we say goodbye.

484
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,920
Is that what you really want?

485
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,470
It's how it must be.

486
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,560
~ I don't understand you.
~ You will, if you try.

487
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,510
~ Spratt will see you to the car.
~ I'll do that.

488
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,440
~ I should be going.
~ Oh, thank you.

489
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,510
Good night.

490
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,720
Good night.

491
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,830
I have the sense that a game of high
stakes has been played here tonight.

492
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,590
Although I couldn't tell you
who the winner is.

493
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,950
Me, I hope.

494
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,360
Good night.

495
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,760
So, have you told the prince his
cause is hopeless?

496
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,400
Yes.

497
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,550
I am sad to say.

498
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,190
Sad?

499
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,080
I will never again receive
an immoral proposition from a man.

500
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,910
Was I so wrong to savour it?

501
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,030
Ow.

502
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,710
What is the matter?

503
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,310
I should go. Barrow will be waiting
for me in the dressing room.

504
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,310
Let him wait! I want you tell me
whatever it is you're hiding.

505
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,230
I'm not hiding it, exactly.
It's probably nothing.

506
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,190
And what if it isn't nothing?

507
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,510
I've been having some pains
in my chest.

508
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,910
~ Well, my chest, my side, my tummy.
~ What sort of pains?

509
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,350
Quite sharp.

510
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,630
So I went to see a man I'd heard
about in York.

511
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,230
~ He said I have - well, I might have
angina. ~ Oh, my God!

512
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,240
This is why I didn't want to tell
you about it.

513
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,830
It doesn't mean that I'm about to
drop down dead of a heart attack.

514
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,150
But he wants me to go for tests when
we get back.

515
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,070
~ Then you shouldn't be shooting.
~ He said if it relaxes me, it's fine.

516
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,390
I don't know how relaxing this trip
is.

517
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,160
It was unpleasant, wasn't it, to see
a man shouting at his butler.

518
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,160
~ I think I will speak to Edith.
~ Why now?

519
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,910
Well,

520
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,030
you never know what's coming, do
you?

521
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,590
I want to make it clear that
everything's all right between us.

522
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,430
Please look after yourself!

523
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,560
But that's your job, my darling, and
you do it so well.

524
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,990
Mrs Crawley said how much she
enjoyed the evening, m'Lady.

525
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,430
It was colourful. Thank Mrs Potter
for the delicious dinner,

526
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,230
but please tell her I need a rest
from such rich delights.

527
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,270
~ Are you ready to go up, m'Lady?
~ Yes.

528
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,350
What about some of Miss Denker's
famous broth?

529
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,510
I'm aware that you're teasing,
Spratt,

530
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,190
but as a matter of fact, it would be
very nice.

531
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,870
Miss Denker, would you take up the
challenge of the wooden spoon?

532
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:55,070
Wouldn't I be in Mrs Potter's way?
I'd never want to be a nuisance.

533
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,710
I bet you wouldn't. There's a stove
in the still room.

534
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,190
~ Could you manage with that, Denker?
~ I'd be delighted, m'Lady.

535
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,280
You see, Spratt, not every spring and
lever evades your touch.

536
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,480
Come in.

537
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,790
~ Papa, is something the matter?
~ No, nothing's the matter.

538
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,480
~ And that's what I want to make
clear. ~ I don't understand.

539
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,680
What's this about?

540
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
Marigold.

541
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,630
I see.

542
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,190
And what do you want to say about
Marigold?

543
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,200
I think you know what I want to say,
what I want you to say.

544
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,480
I can't give her up.

545
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,600
Of course not.

546
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,910
Have you told Tom?

547
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,670
No.

548
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,630
~ But he might have guessed.
~ So now everyone knows?

549
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,000
Everyone except Mary.

550
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,390
I want your forgiveness, Papa.

551
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,590
Am I allowed to say that, still?

552
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,070
It's not the way I'd have had
things,

553
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,070
I won't lie to you about that,

554
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,030
but this is what's happened.

555
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,790
~ I believe Michael Gregson was an
honourable man. ~ Oh, he was, Papa.

556
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,910
He really was.

557
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,230
He would have married me as soon as
he could, I know that.

558
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,550
I think so, too.

559
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,870
So now we must do our best
for his child,

560
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,950
for his sake, as well as yours.

561
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,080
That's so lovely of you.

562
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,870
But I think we should keep it
in the family.

563
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,630
Even in 1924, there are plenty of
people who might be unpleasant.

564
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,110
But...

565
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,280
do you forgive me, Papa?

566
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,110
Oh, my darling, I'm sure I need your
forgiveness

567
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,200
quite as much as you need mine.

568
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,760
Now, go to bed.

569
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,240
And sleep well.

570
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,850
I gather you got more than you
bargained for.

571
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,410
I've had my run-ins
with His Lordship before,

572
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,090
but I have never been insulted in
public, and I don't intend to start
now.

573
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,050
Still, Mr Stowell got a flea in his
ear and that's what we wanted.

574
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,050
What you and Lady Mary wanted,
perhaps. I've got bigger plans now.

575
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,100
~ What do you mean?
~ Oh, you'll see.

576
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,980
Yes.

577
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,610
What do you want?

578
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,940
To add my sympathy, Mr Stowell.

579
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,050
He insulted me an' all, you know.

580
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,850
I felt for you, and I thought
you showed great restraint.

581
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,780
For a servant in that situation,
restraint is Hobson's choice.

582
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,500
Write something.

583
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,170
~ How do you mean?
~ Write something.

584
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,060
'My name is Barrow and I live in
Yorkshire.'

585
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,780
~ It wasn't you, then.
~ Why would it be me?

586
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,700
The staff resent me.

587
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:31,170
Their butler's on holiday and they
hate taking orders from me.

588
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:35,210
That doesn't give his His Lordship
much excuse to behave as he did.

589
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,850
'His Lordship'!

590
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,530
His Lordship, with a title that's
not ten minutes old.

591
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,210
I know a lot about His
Dirty-fingered Lordship.

592
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,170
~ And he's forgotten that.
~ I expect you could tell me things

593
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,090
you wouldn't much like to read
on the front page of The Times.

594
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,930
You'd be surprised.

595
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,140
Go on, then... surprise me.

596
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,170
It's a shame Lord Sinderby wouldn't
come.

597
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,090
Mother did ask him. She thought it
might get rid of

598
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,330
some of the nasty taste of last
night, but he said, 'No.'

599
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,010
He's a difficult man. O-Or shouldn't
I say that?

600
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,530
You can say what you like after that
dinner.

601
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,050
Oh, well, at least we gave the
county something to talk about.

602
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,450
I wonder what the truth was about the
letter from the valet.

603
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,410
Baxter says it was one of the castle
staff. They hate Stowell.

604
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,450
~ They'll hear no argument from me.
~ Well, it's over now.

605
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,460
Why were you all in a huddle at
breakfast?

606
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,050
Atticus has been offered a job in New
York.

607
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,050
Oh, congratulations.

608
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,330
Thank you. Aren't you going to
America soon?

609
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,330
~ I-I am. I'm going to Boston.
~ When?

610
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:45,130
I'm planning to spend Christmas at
Downton and leave in the new year.

611
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,730
~ Well, it hasn't been decided yet.
~ Poor Mary.

612
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,290
She hates to be left behind
when everyone else is getting on
with their lives.

613
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,380
This isn't that - it's the thought
of being left with you.

614
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,410
You can't manage a broth, Miss
Denker, special or otherwise?

615
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,570
~ I'd be very good at it.
~ If you only knew where to start.

616
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,530
I should never have volunteered.

617
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,810
But if you'd seen the look
on Mr Spratt's face,

618
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,330
you'd have sworn you could paint the
Mona Lisa and be finished by teatime.

619
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,690
~ Won't Mrs Potter help?
~ I don't trust her.

620
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,690
~ I think she's in league with the
enemy. ~ Blimey!

621
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,250
We'd all better come work at the
Dower House.

622
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,050
Sounds more exciting than here.

623
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,370
How much attention will they pay to
Mrs Bates' past?

624
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,250
Well, you can see the problem -

625
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,890
a man attacks her, she stabs him
with a knife.

626
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,250
Now there's another attack and she
pushes him to his death

627
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,810
on a busy road.

628
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,090
There is... a pattern.

629
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,810
If that's what you think, then why
are you here?

630
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,890
Mrs Bates, I hope we've not left our
manners outside the prison gates.

631
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,410
Of course, your stepfather didn't
bring a charge against you.

632
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,970
That was my mother's doing.

633
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,770
It may mean we can have it ruled as
inadmissible.

634
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,530
That would undermine their case and
it might never come to a trial.

635
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,300
~ Can you achieve such a ruling?
~ I will do everything I can.

636
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,690
You seem to think I'm angry with
your sons. I'm not at all!

637
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,850
Then why can't we forget that
horrible evening happened?

638
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,290
I'm not angry with them,

639
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,890
but I accept they have no desire to
see their mother replaced.

640
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,810
This is my fault. I've taken such
care to shield them from the truth.

641
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,770
~ Which is?
~ I was wretched with their mother.

642
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,290
~ Perhaps she was wretched with you.
~ No doubt. We were very ill-suited.

643
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,210
But now they're preventing my first
chance of real happiness.

644
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to
live the rest of my life

645
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,290
in an atmosphere of loathing and
resentment.

646
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,580
I will not come between
a father and his sons.

647
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,700
Then may I ask you to be honest?

648
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,930
Is that the only barrier?

649
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,330
If they were to welcome you into
the family, you would marry me?

650
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,860
I would.

651
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,210
And I should be very glad to.

652
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,770
So,

653
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,380
there is my challenge.

654
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,330
How do you get rid of all this scum?

655
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,570
It's the onions - they're only
supposed to sweat,

656
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,890
but I think they fell down
exhausted.

657
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,490
And you went a bit mad with the
salt.

658
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,260
Shall we taste it?

659
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,850
Oh, my God!

660
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,330
Why don't I just make a bottle of
it?

661
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:20,450
Then I could bring it to the house,

662
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,380
you could warm it through
and serve it. No-one will ever know.

663
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,210
For now, we could give you all the
ingredients

664
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,300
so you could chop them about
for Mr Spratt's benefit.

665
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,330
I'll use every precedent there is.

666
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,890
But if the story's admitted as
evidence, will she be convicted?

667
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,570
Where the law is concerned, you can
never be sure about anything.

668
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,940
Will she?

669
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,770
They have a strong motive, and they
can prove opportunity

670
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,930
~ because she was in London, which we
do not deny. ~ No.

671
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,170
Now she's been identified on the
pavement nearby at that moment.

672
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,930
They'll use the earlier case to prove
it wasn't against her nature.

673
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,700
It's quite strong, I'm afraid.

674
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,850
The cook's happy for you to announce
dinner.

675
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,140
Thank you.

676
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020
Mr Barrow.

677
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,690
I'm afraid I said too much last
night.

678
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,090
I was angry, and I'd had more to
drink than was good for me.

679
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,100
Don't worry about that, Mr Stowell,
I've got a mind like a sieve.

680
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,370
That's dinner, everyone.

681
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,330
Will you shoot tomorrow, or have you
given way to the uninvited guest?

682
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,970
~ I don't think I have a choice.
~ You can have my place.

683
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,850
Certainly not! I've had two good
days, we're out on Friday,

684
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,290
~ so I don't merit pity.
~ I hope your neighbour knows

685
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,130
~ how accommodating you're being.
~ You can tell him -

686
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,370
~ he's staying the night.
~ Don't tempt me.

687
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,330
I do find it astonishing the way
people take these things for granted.

688
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,060
We can't all be as unselfish as you,
Mary. Just joking!

689
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,570
You'll like this.

690
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:15,410
It's not dear, but I think
it's very good value.

691
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,770
I've done the sums

692
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,010
and I believe
we should put an offer in

693
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,530
on the house on Brancour Road.

694
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,100
~ Before I agree to be part of it?
~ I hope you will agree.

695
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,260
To our future as property magnates.

696
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,450
Very well.

697
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,090
I can see there's no escape, and I
must tell the truth.

698
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,650
~ I've never caught you in a lie.
~ No, I don't lie,

699
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,780
but there are things I don't say.

700
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,090
I've allowed this folly to go on
because... I don't know, really,

701
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,850
because it was a nice idea.

702
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,250
And I would have liked to come in
with you, I would have...

703
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:05,100
~ But you won't.
~ I won't, because I can't.

704
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,820
I don't know if I've ever told you
that I have a sister.

705
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,290
I've always thought you had no
family left.

706
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,650
Which may be because that's what I
wanted you to think.

707
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,500
My sister Becky was born...

708
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,420
She's not quite right in the head.

709
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,010
While my mother was alive, she
looked after her,

710
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,010
~ but when she died...
~ There was no-one but you.

711
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,490
Precisely.

712
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,010
My choice was simple.

713
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,250
Either I gave up work and we lived on
a pittance,

714
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,850
or I went on working and paid for her
to be cared for.

715
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,050
But that must have cost a fortune.

716
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,220
It cost every penny I could spare.

717
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,570
So there you have it, I've got no
savings because I've got no money.

718
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,130
I'm a pauper.

719
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:58,290
But... what about your retirement?

720
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:02,650
~ Have you not paid into any schemes?
~ I can't retire.

721
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,860
I must work for as long as anyone
will let me.

722
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,100
I wish you very well with your house,
Mr Cason - you've earned it.

723
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,100
But there is no place for me
in the project.

724
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,890
~ Now I've embarrassed you.
~ Mm.

725
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,850
I'm not embarrassed.

726
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,730
I'm ashamed

727
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,690
that I've chivvied and bullied you,

728
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,930
when if I'd had any sensitivity at
all -

729
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,650
No, don't say that.

730
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,730
I've enjoyed our little dream.

731
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,970
~ I'm the one to blame for stringing
you along. ~ Oh, never.

732
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,050
Well, as I say, I hope you buy it.

733
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,690
~ I hope you're able to without me.
~ I am, but...

734
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,570
I've had a telegram from Mr Murray.

735
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,690
May I use your telephone, Mr Carson?
He says it's bad news.

736
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:57,420
Oh, no. I'm sorry to hear that.
Be my guest.

737
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,970
Rose, you chum Tom.

738
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,100
Mary, go with Mr Talbot.

739
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,540
Rachel...

740
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:17,740
~ Oh, sort it out between you.
~ I'll see you all there.

741
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,210
~ I'm not sure where I'm supposed to
go. ~ He's such a controller.

742
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,010
Go where you'd like. Mr Rogers?

743
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:27,930
~ Would it be awful if I were left
alone with my loader? ~ Of course not.

744
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,770
I wouldn't mind, if you've nothing
better to do.

745
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,770
I'm Bertie Pelham, the agent.

746
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,370
~ Are you often asked to come when
there's shooting? ~ No, I'm not.

747
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,450
I'm staying for dinner, which they
REALLY didn't have to do.

748
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,900
It's very kind.

749
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,810
Thanks for keeping my spirits up.

750
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:49,130
Some men hate having strangers with
them. My father does.

751
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,340
Oh, I don't mind. Especially not you.

752
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:56,090
You're staying with Mr Rogers,
aren't you?

753
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,970
That's right. Lord Sinderby said he
could bring me.

754
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,930
~ Very decent of him.
~ Do you shoot at lot?

755
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,620
Not at this level.

756
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,300
That explains it.

757
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,530
~ What explains what?
~ Nothing.

758
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,490
~ No, go on, I insist.
~ Well, it's none of my business,

759
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,450
but Atticus isn't shooting to make
room for you.

760
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,570
Lord Sinderby's son? That's terrible.

761
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,930
Why didn't somebody tell Charlie
there was no room?

762
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,860
They thought it inhospitable.

763
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:25,490
As soon as this drive's over,
I'll swap places.

764
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,340
No, don't. His guns are back at
the castle, it's all settled now.

765
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,050
Look, forget I said anything.

766
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,220
Is your husband one of the other
guns?

767
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:41,010
No, although my late husband was
quite good at it.

768
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,980
In the end.

769
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,780
You're a young widow.

770
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,410
But then I suppose the war gave us
many young widows.

771
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,570
It wasn't the war. In fact...

772
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,250
Look out. Here they come.

773
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,380
~ Well done!
~ Fluke.

774
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,170
~ How long have you been the agent?
~ About a year and a half.

775
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,250
~ But I've known Brancaster all my
life. ~ Oh?

776
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,530
The old Lord Hexham was my father's
cousin.

777
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,930
Second cousin.

778
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,500
They've both dead now, but we used
to come here every so often.

779
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,890
Which is why you were given the job?

780
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,660
~ That's rather a leading question.
~ Sorry!

781
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,450
Of course, you're right.

782
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,930
When my father died, I left the
Army.

783
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,970
I didn't know what to do next,

784
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,730
and I suppose Cousin Peter felt
sorry for me.

785
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,300
~ No burning ambitions?
~ Not really.

786
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,530
I'm always jealous of those chaps

787
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,690
who fly the Channel, invent a cure
or something.

788
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,140
What about you? Are you pining for
some unfulfilled dream?

789
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,300
Not today.

790
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,740
Today I feel... very happy.

791
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,930
Good morning, Daisy.

792
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,610
Can I help you with anything?

793
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,490
No, thank you, Mr Spratt.

794
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,180
I were just...
I looked in on Miss Denker.

795
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,770
I see.

796
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:36,970
What are you carrying so diligently?

797
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,450
Ah!

798
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,690
~ Basket's empty.
~ Yes.

799
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,780
~ I'm looking in at the shops on my
way back. ~ Ah.

800
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,900
I have news of my own.

801
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,930
As you know, I told you I'd
discussed it all with Dickie.

802
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:59,530
You agreed to marry him if he could
bring his sons around.

803
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,170
This morning... I had a letter
from Larry Grey.

804
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,650
Oh, goodness! Is it polite?

805
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,210
Judge for yourself.

806
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:08,730
'Dear Mrs Crawley.'

807
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,370
Well, that's a good start.

808
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,810
The sentiment of the greeting is not
reflected in the text.

809
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:17,050
'My father has requested that I
re-examine my feelings

810
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,570
when it comes to your proposed
union.

811
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:23,730
I have re-examined them and I find
them to be unchanged.

812
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:26,890
I hope you'll persuade him to avoid
any further attempts

813
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,770
to make me reconsider,

814
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,420
which could only prove embarrassing
to us both.'

815
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:36,740
'Yours sincerely, Larry Grey.'

816
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,370
~ Have you shown this to him?
~ Not yet.

817
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,930
I'm not sure I should.

818
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,570
And I suppose you'll take it lying
down.

819
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,210
I'll take it lying down, standing up
or in a semi-recumbent posture.

820
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,490
The matter is decided.

821
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,970
I will not have my final years
overshadowed

822
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,850
by a tear-stained tug of war.

823
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,380
I suppose there's one consolation.

824
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,530
What's that?

825
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,460
Dr Clarkson will be delighted!

826
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,040
Thank you.

827
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,710
What's that?

828
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,750
Murray telephoned this morning.
There's a date for Anna's trial.

829
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,590
~ Oh, no.
~ What's that?

830
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,920
Anna's going for tr-

831
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,030
That settles it. You will not shoot
any more today, or tomorrow.

832
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:47,390
~ Don't embarrass me, please.
~ I won't if you do as I say.

833
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,110
What can I do to help?

834
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,390
Take my place this afternoon.

835
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,230
~ What's the matter, Papa?
~ I'm perfectly all right,

836
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,230
I just need to take things a little
easy.

837
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,000
If only he'd chosen not to be all
man-like and keep it concealed.

838
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,190
Is there anything I can do?

839
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,070
You could send someone to fetch Mr
Aldridge's guns.

840
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,670
You see, this is why I didn't want
to make a thing of it.

841
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,520
~ Is it really true about Anna?
~ We'll know more when we get home.

842
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,670
You've probably heard
you're off the hook.

843
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,790
Papa's given his place to Atticus,
so you'll pay no price for your
thoughtlessness.

844
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,350
Be a sport and forgive me.

845
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,910
I'm here for the night, I don't want
you scowling at me through dinner.

846
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,870
~ I shall scowl if I think you deserve
it. ~ I never meant it to happen.

847
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,270
Isn't there something called
'forgiveness through good intention'?

848
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,880
Only for Catholics. Let's sit down.

849
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,070
Surely you can't have meant for
Daisy to make the broth

850
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,600
instead of your good self?

851
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,310
This is all for show, isn't it?

852
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,030
Your intention was to serve Daisy's
excellent soup

853
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,720
and take the credit yourself.

854
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,440
What have you done with it?

855
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,710
I felt it would be discourteous to
give it back,

856
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:07,070
so it just seems best to pour it
away and never speak of it again.

857
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,110
Don't you agree? You must make it
yourself now, Miss Denker.

858
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,830
Good luck to you.

859
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,670
~ I'm glad to find you here and not in
bed. Have you recovered? ~ Completely.

860
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,590
~ I suppose I missed a marvellous
afternoon. ~ Spectacular.

861
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,110
~ Is Papa really ill?
~ I don't know.

862
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,950
Now I just want to get him home in
one piece.

863
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,320
I think we should wait a few
minutes.

864
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,750
Stowell, who is this?

865
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,310
~ God Almighty.
~ What is it? What's happened?

866
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,750
What the hell is she doing here?

867
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,470
~ What's her name? Tell me her name.
~ What?

868
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,750
Tell me her name and I'll save you.

869
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,030
Diana.

870
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,790
Diana Clark.

871
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,630
Diana. I don't believe you.

872
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,030
I never thought you'd make it!

873
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,910
~ This is my friend, Diana Clark.
~ Oh!

874
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,070
She said she'd be in the
neighbourhood

875
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,750
and I asked her to look in if she
had any time.

876
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,710
You must stay for tea. And what is
this little chap called?

877
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,390
Er... Dan-Daniel.

878
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,600
Daniel? How extraordinary -
that's Lord Sinderby's name.

879
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,080
Would you come with me? Come on.

880
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,030
Play along and it will be fine.

881
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,870
The telegram said he'd be alone and
to bring the boy.

882
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,790
I'm sure it did, but unfortunately
he didn't send it.

883
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,470
Hello. I'm Atticus, Rose's husband.
Why have we never met before?

884
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,270
I agree. How silly is that?

885
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,790
Who is that woman? She can't be a
great friend of Rose,

886
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,550
~ I've never seen her before in my
life. ~ Nor me.

887
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,790
The truth is, I asked Barrow to get
Stowell into trouble,

888
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,630
and I'm afraid he overdid it.

889
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,960
What's the matter?

890
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,110
You look as if you've had a stroke.

891
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,190
Oh, I can't have two of you laid up
in one day.

892
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,070
Just a bit tired, that's all.

893
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,120
~ I'll lie down before dinner.
~ All right.

894
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,310
We're so interested to meet your very
old friend Mrs Clark,

895
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,590
~ whom we have never clapped eyes on
before. ~ (Help me.)

896
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,910
~ Only if you tell me what's going on.
~ (Come.)

897
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,350
Oh, of course, you all know each
other.

898
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,230
Diana, it's so lovely to see you
again.

899
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,750
Indeed it is.

900
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:23,590
How have you been since you were
last at Downton?

901
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:28,160
~ Oh... well. Awfully, awfully well.
~ Will you excuse me?

902
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,950
I wish he'd come and speak to me. I
suppose he can't.

903
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Who?

904
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,110
Oh, crikey! No, he can't.

905
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,080
I've come all the way from London.

906
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,160
Who would do such a nasty thing?

907
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,080
Oh, I think I know, and I think I
know why.

908
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,720
But it won't help to tell you.

909
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,560
~ Mr Bates! Are you going somewhere?
~ I am.

910
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,240
In fact, can I ask a favour,
Mr Molesley?

911
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,230
Can you give these to Mr Carson?

912
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,070
~ He'll know what to do with him.
~ He's about somewhere.

913
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,870
I'd rather not see him. And don't
give them to him yet.

914
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,550
~ Wait till this evening.
~ Mr Bates, are you in trouble?

915
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,150
My wife's in prison - I'd call that
trouble, wouldn't you?

916
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,230
Because I want you to know I'd
gladly help you in any way I can.

917
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,920
I'm touched by that. I mean it.
Thank you.

918
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,040
But the only way you can help me now
is by delivering those letters.

919
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,680
Just a moment.

920
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,110
You acted to save Lord Sinderby, but
you saved me, too.

921
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,910
~ From a hideous situation,
and I am so grateful. ~ No need.

922
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,400
~ Please try not to think ill of him.
~ Oh, I'm not sure what I think.

923
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,990
Maybe it's good to know he has the
same feet of clay as the rest of us.

924
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,870
~ Goodbye, Mrs Clark.
~ Oh, you must call her Diana.

925
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:05,240
~ Diana. No doubt we'll meet in London.
I look forward to it. ~ Me, too.

926
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,150
Are you off?

927
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,790
No, I'm just going up to change, but
I can't find my white tie.

928
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:23,000
~ Of course! I forgot you were staying
for dinner. ~ Oh!

929
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,550
Stowell looks like he's in a cage
with a tiger.

930
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,550
Are you going to give him away to
your father-in-law?

931
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,720
Stowell!

932
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,400
How did you know about Mrs Clark?

933
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,230
Will you tell His Lordship, m'Lady?

934
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,030
I can't decide.

935
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,870
But... in the meantime, I hope you
can be more polite to Mr Branson

936
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,960
~ while he's with us.
~ Certainly, m'Lady.

937
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,680
Rose, Mary, Robert.

938
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,160
Would you stay in here for a moment,
please?

939
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,030
I'm glad to have caught you three.

940
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,870
~ I wasn't sure I could manage it.
~ I'm intrigued.

941
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,430
Oh, you needn't pretend.

942
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,710
You saw the depths of my humiliation
earlier.

943
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,870
Who planned it, I wonder?

944
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,150
Everyone has enemies.

945
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,070
I'd be grateful if we could restrict
this knowledge to our number.

946
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:29,190
I do not believe any of you would
wish to cause Rachel or Atticus pain.

947
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,910
No-one else will ever know.

948
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,310
The truth is, it could all have been
very much worse.

949
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,950
And that it was not
is due entirely to Rose.

950
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,480
Rose, my dear...

951
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:45,040
.. you are clever, kind
and resourceful.

952
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,750
And I wish to put it on record

953
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,110
that I see now that we are lucky to
have you in the family.

954
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,990
I shall be inviting your parents to
stay as soon as is convenient.

955
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,270
~ You don't have to.
~ Oh, I think I do.

956
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,550
We all know that people who live in
glass houses

957
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,600
are ill-advised to throw stones.

958
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,830
Now, I've had a gramophone put into
the library,

959
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,840
~ so run along and enjoy yourselves.
~ Golly! What fun!

960
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,440
Thank you.

961
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,870
She'll love you forever
if you'll let her.

962
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,510
That's who she is.

963
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,590
I know that now.

964
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:24,520
I was stupid not to have seen it
before.

965
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,830
The letters to His Lordship and
Mr Murray must tell the same story.

966
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,310
Why confess? It makes no sense.

967
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:36,230
The police said someone short pushed
Mr Green.

968
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,990
Mr Bates isn't short!

969
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,990
Didn't he spend that day in York?

970
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,550
~ The lost ticket was never used.
~ If only it wasn't lost.

971
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,550
Do we know what he was doing there?

972
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,070
He said he had lunch in a pub, he
couldn't remember which one.

973
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,110
There are hundreds of pubs in York.

974
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,750
But Mr Bates had lunch in one of
them.

975
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:58,430
I don't believe he's guilty, whatever
he's written there.

976
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,230
He just wants Anna out of prison, and
I don't blame him for that.

977
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,990
Might I have the key for Mr Bates'
cottage?

978
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,910
You never know, he might have left
a clue as to where he was going.

979
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:13,880
I'm not sure what we'll do with it
if he has, but you can have the key.

980
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,670
(Is there anything I can get you,
sir? Anything you'd like?)

981
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,870
N-No. No, thank you, Stowell.

982
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,800
You've been very considerate.

983
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,840
~ That makes it all worth it.
~ Makes what worth it?

984
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,950
It would take too long to explain.

985
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,470
Suffice to say, the butler is back in
his box.

986
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:00,030
~ Well, that sounds rather snobbish.
~ Not in this instance.

987
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:03,190
What was really going on this
afternoon with that woman?

988
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:05,270
The one with the little boy in tow.

989
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,110
What makes you think there was
anything going on?

990
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,430
All right. Why was Lord Sinderby
in a panic?

991
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,030
Why did Lady Rose take over?

992
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,790
Why did your father pretend to know
the visitor when he clearly did not?

993
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,830
And why was Lady Sinderby in total
ignorance throughout?

994
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,070
Naturally, I'm not going to answer
any of your questions,

995
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,910
but I'm impressed you should ask
them. Well done.

996
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,590
~ Are you looking forward to going
home? ~ Why, particularly?

997
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:36,030
~ Aren't you missing Marigold?
~ Aren't you missing Sybbie?

998
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,240
Isn't Mary missing George?

999
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,150
Not quite as much.

1000
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,800
What are you trying to say?

1001
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,350
Not a lot, really.

1002
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,910
But these will be my last months at
Downton,

1003
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,000
and you have always been my ally.

1004
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,110
I'd like to feel we were honest with
each other.

1005
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,520
You see, where I grew up, there were
quite a few Marigolds.

1006
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,000
~ I'm not sure I understand you.
~ I think you do.

1007
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:07,670
My cousin Nuala had a child that was
brought up as her sister.

1008
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,550
No-one talked of it, naturally, but
we all knew.

1009
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,910
~ I told Papa you'd guessed.
~ So they're both in on it?

1010
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,360
They are now.

1011
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,710
~ And Mary? Does she know?
~ No.

1012
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,470
She's completely uninterested in me,
which should keep me safe.

1013
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,870
Please, keep it to yourself.

1014
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,070
Not for my sake so much as for hers.

1015
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,920
You may not believe it, but I'm a
signed-up member of this family now.

1016
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,680
~ Can I have this one?
~ Of course.

1017
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,150
You look very intense.

1018
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,390
Oh, we were just talking about our
ward.

1019
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,070
My family adopted a little girl.

1020
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,670
She's growing up at Downton.

1021
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,910
What's the new Lord Hexham like?
He must be your cousin.

1022
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,110
My third cousin. Does that count?

1023
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,950
Is he nice?

1024
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,110
Peter's all right.
He's not here much.

1025
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,110
Always seems to be in North Africa.

1026
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:15,400
Do you always ask so many questions?

1027
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,030
I'm glad I've caught you.

1028
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,350
They said in the dining room
you'd left.

1029
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,720
~ I hope it didn't spoil your
breakfast. ~ I haven't had it yet.

1030
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,110
We wanted to make an early start.

1031
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,270
~ Charlie's got something on this
afternoon. ~ Well, goodbye, Mr Talbot.

1032
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,030
I feel guilty now trying to make you
feel uncomfortable yesterday.

1033
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,910
But you were quite right.

1034
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:23,270
I'll be less... cavalier next time.

1035
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,390
Maybe we'll meet again.

1036
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,200
Are you ever in Yorkshire?

1037
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,670
I have an aunt up there. So you
never know.

1038
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,790
~ Perhaps we'll meet shooting.
~ Maybe.

1039
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,750
~ But it's not my real sport.
~ What is?

1040
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,470
Cars.

1041
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,310
~ Cars?
~ Henry, we must go.

1042
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,950
Heavens! What a snappy chariot.

1043
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,880
Mr Rogers clearly has hidden depths.

1044
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,240
It's mine.

1045
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,320
But thanks for the compliment.

1046
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,330
~ Welcome back, my Lord.
~ Carson.

1047
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,250
There's been a development while you
were away.

1048
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,730
Mr Bates has gone.

1049
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:43,890
~ I don't understand. Gone where?
~ We don't know, my Lord,

1050
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,930
~ but he's left you a letter.
~ How very mysterious.

1051
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,100
Come on.

1052
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:52,930
Mr Carson. So, does that mean I stay
on as valet,

1053
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,930
~ or am I expected to double up?
~ It all has to be thought through.

1054
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:00,170
They must release Mrs Bates
now that they've got a confession.

1055
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:03,450
No doubt His Lordship is telephoning
Mr Murray as we speak.

1056
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,690
~ Will he be hiding somewhere?
~ In Ireland, I presume.

1057
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:10,570
He has family there. And the English
police are not too well regarded

1058
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,970
if they try to find him.

1059
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:14,850
Why hasn't Anna been released?
Why did Carson wait?

1060
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,010
I'll telephone Murray now. He'll be
able to get her out.

1061
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,610
~ I don't believe for a moment Bates
did it. ~ No!

1062
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:24,010
But neither did Anna. So it won't be
unjust to set her free.

1063
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,850
Have you caught up with yourself?

1064
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,610
I'll be straight by the time
they finish dinner.

1065
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,210
Mr Molesley,

1066
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:33,770
when you said earlier about what
you were planning to for Mr Bates,

1067
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:36,010
~ using his photo...
~ Yes?

1068
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,220
I'd like to be helpful.
I'd like to...

1069
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:41,700
~ .. come with you.
~ Would you?

1070
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,860
Because that would help a lot!

1071
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:48,410
But I don't want anyone else to
know.

1072
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,380
Not unless it works.

1073
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,570
He's sure he can get her out at
once. He's coming up tomorrow.

1074
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,980
~ Well, that's something.
~ Yes.

1075
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,220
What is it?

1076
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,770
In his letter to me,
Bates has left instructions

1077
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,050
for how to get a message through
to him.

1078
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:14,330
~ An Irish address and telephone
number. ~ Has he told anyone else?

1079
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,740
Not as far I as know. Not Carson.

1080
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,810
What do you think I should do?

1081
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:23,370
What you should do is easy -
tell the police.

1082
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,860
But what I would do is keep it secret
until we know more.

1083
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,860
Thank heaven we both have a criminal
turn of mind.

1084
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:55,570
~ I should go in round the back.
~ No, no, no.

1085
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:58,090
Come this way to say hello to
His Lordship.

1086
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,650
~ I saw the car. What a relief.
~ We were waiting for it.

1087
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:04,930
Yes, but I'm not released, m'Lord.

1088
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,370
~ I'm still on bail.
~ Maybe.

1089
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,210
But with a signed confession and a
man on the run,

1090
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,650
they could never hope for a guilty
verdict.

1091
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,130
And if they find him and prove him
innocent, do I go back to prison?

1092
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,700
It is a very frustrating situation.

1093
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,890
If he's guilty, I'm innocent.

1094
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:22,690
And if I'm guilty, he's innocent.

1095
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:25,930
~ Except neither of us did it.
~ Which is what we must prove.

1096
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:27,890
You're home now, that's something.

1097
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,450
At least we're going forwards, not
backwards.

1098
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:32,730
Now, can the car take me to the
station?

1099
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:36,330
Stark will drive us both. I have to
be in York in half an hour,

1100
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,490
so I'm leaving now.

1101
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,970
~ Carson, will you tell Her Ladyship
where I've gone? ~ Certainly, my Lord.

1102
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:42,570
Do you want to come in this way?

1103
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:45,570
No, I'll go round by the kitchen
courtyard, m'Lady.

1104
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,100
Might as well get back into the
swing of things.

1105
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,650
Well, so this is the famous broth?

1106
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,570
What else would it be?

1107
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:04,090
Are you ready to be judged on it?

1108
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,610
I shall be judged by you, Mr Spratt,
whatever happens.

1109
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:09,970
If you mean I will judge you for
promoting yourself

1110
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:13,210
through lies and fraud,
then, yes, I will.

1111
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,450
So will she.

1112
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,340
Your unmasking is at hand.

1113
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:26,210
God in Heaven!

1114
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,650
Oh, Denker.

1115
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:30,530
~ Oh.
~ I was talking menus with Mrs Potter,

1116
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,170
and Spratt reminded me about the
broth.

1117
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,930
~ He didn't want your efforts to be
overlooked. ~ I'm sure he didn't.

1118
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:38,090
Not a chance!

1119
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,930
~ Of course, the proof of the pudding
is in he eating, m'Lady. ~ Indeed.

1120
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,220
So, may I taste it?

1121
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,980
Uh...

1122
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,180
Thank you.

1123
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:01,700
I warned you, m'Lady.

1124
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,930
It is...

1125
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,620
delicious.

1126
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,650
It can't be! It's not possible!

1127
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,730
There's a point, Spratt, where malice
ceases to be amusing.

1128
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,170
Thank you, Denker, very much.

1129
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:20,850
I'm not hungry enough to do your soup
justice this evening.

1130
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:25,130
Let us... save its delights for
another day.

1131
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:27,290
Whatever you wish, Your Ladyship.

1132
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:29,180
~ Thank you.
~ Thank you. Thank you.

1133
01:10:42,220 --> 01:10:44,730
I thought you'd look in before you
came down.

1134
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,090
~ To tell you how I got on in York?
~ Yes.

1135
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,770
I wanted to wait until we were all
together.

1136
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:53,010
You'll be pleased to hear I am not
about to have a heart attack.

1137
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,770
~ Your father has an ulcer.
~ Oh, that's a relief!

1138
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:00,650
Yes, it is a relief, but you've got
to be good with your diet.

1139
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:05,370
Well said. We'll take it seriously -
white fish, chicken, no alcohol.

1140
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,690
~ Steady on!
~ I mean it! You frightened me.

1141
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,970
~ I don't like to be frightened.
~ There must be room for negotiation.

1142
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,170
Why don't you promise to lay off
everything until Christmas Day?

1143
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:16,810
~ Christmas Eve.
~ Very well. Christmas Eve. Mama?

1144
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:19,090
I suppose. But I'll be strict.

1145
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,890
We'll have a merry Christmas as
my last memory of Downton.

1146
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,330
~ Don't make it sound so final!
~ I'll be back one day.

1147
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:27,490
~ I'll need to see how the village
turned out. ~ That reminds me.

1148
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,890
Good news in the Evening Post. The
Della Francesca sold amazingly well.

1149
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:36,090
~ That's wonderful.
~ Let's go through.

1150
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,690
Shall we?

1151
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:39,810
Wonderful news. Congratulations.

1152
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,810
Hallelujah. We are to have another
footman to help you, Mr Molesley.

1153
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,210
How did you wangle that?

1154
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:48,930
His Lordship has had some good news,
I shamelessly took advantage.

1155
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:51,450
Did I hear right?
Are we to have a new footman?

1156
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,450
Do your ears have wireless aerials?

1157
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,850
I hope you'll give another chance to
Andy.

1158
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,570
~ The lad we had in London for Lady
Rose's wedding? ~ He was nice.

1159
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:02,450
I remember him gabbing around town
with Miss Denker

1160
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,730
~ and staying out till all hours.
~ I had no trouble with the lad.

1161
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,300
But it's your decision.

1162
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:30,370
Are you ready for the lights?

1163
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:33,810
Three, two, one...

1164
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:36,020
It's beautiful, Daddy!

1165
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,370
No luck there.

1166
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:44,330
Shall we have a break after the next
one?

1167
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:47,010
~ I think that's a good idea.
~ Where to now?

1168
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:49,340
I believe it's the Fountain Inn.

1169
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,740
Shut your eyes!

1170
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:58,530
I...thought you'd like to know
I've bought the house.

1171
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:02,010
~ We've completed.
~ Oh, I am pleased.

1172
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:04,810
That's a nice thing to know before
Christmas.

1173
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,380
You can open them now.

1174
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:08,930
Oh!

1175
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,410
Will we be a big party?

1176
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,290
Family, really.

1177
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:16,610
Mr Atticus and Lady Rose are coming,
which is nice.

1178
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:18,770
His parents won't bother with
Christmas.

1179
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:20,130
Don't start!

1180
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:23,170
Then I gather they're off to
New York in January,

1181
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:26,010
~ when Mr Branson goes to Boston.
~ Yeah.

1182
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:29,090
I'll miss him.
I don't mind admitting it.

1183
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:31,450
I know you're uncomfortable with him,

1184
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,250
but I feel he's a sort of bridge
between us all.

1185
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:39,220
~ I'm... used to him. I'll say that.
~ Heavens!

1186
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,970
Don't let him hear you, it'll go
straight to his head.

1187
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,860
Ah, Mr Carson. Might I trouble you
for a moment, please?

1188
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,890
Come in. I understand you asked to
see me. Carson will stay.

1189
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:58,890
~ It's about Mr Bates, my Lord.
~ So Carson tells us.

1190
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:02,170
Please, we're all anxious to hear
anything to Bates' good.

1191
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:05,370
How can we get a message to him?
That's what worries me.

1192
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:08,530
Let us concern ourselves with that
when we know the new evidence.

1193
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,290
Mrs Bates told the police he'd spent
the day Mr Green died

1194
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,570
walking round York.

1195
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,410
He said he'd eaten in a pub,
but he couldn't identify it.

1196
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:19,930
~ He must have been out of his mind.
Is it any wonder he'd forgotten? ~ No.

1197
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:21,860
But we know which pub it was.

1198
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,210
What?!

1199
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:28,050
I took a photograph of Mr Bates,
and Miss Baxter and I,

1200
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:31,210
we've spent our days off
walking around the city,

1201
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,450
~ and questioning the landlords.
~ But it must have taken forever.

1202
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:39,170
~ How long have you been doing this?
~ Since we came back from Brancaster.

1203
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:42,490
~ How many pubs have you visited?
~ 60, 70.

1204
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,970
We had a list of them and we ticked
them off one by one.

1205
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,490
We had a third to do when we found
it.

1206
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:48,610
It's er...

1207
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:53,330
~ a Mr Salter of the Picarol in King
Street. ~ He'll swear to this?

1208
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:56,090
He will, m'Lady.
He remembered Mr Bates' limp.

1209
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,930
And he also remembered how he almost
got angry

1210
01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:03,130
~ when Mr Salter tried to help him to
a table. ~ Sounds like Bates.

1211
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,770
Then they started talking

1212
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:08,410
and it turned out they'd both served
in the South African war.

1213
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,650
Mr Bates is quite distinctive, so I
believed we had a good chance.

1214
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,570
May I make a suggestion?

1215
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,090
If Mr Viner accepts this man's
statement,

1216
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:20,050
surely it would overturn any attempt
to prosecute?

1217
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,890
If this does prove Bates' innocence,
which clearly it does,

1218
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,650
won't they re-arrest Anna?

1219
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:26,610
We'll cross that bridge when we
come to it.

1220
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:30,210
~ We can't leave Bates on the run when
he's innocent. ~ Of course not.

1221
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,490
Molesley, Baxter, you've done
something fine.

1222
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,370
Generous and fine.

1223
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:39,010
I'll telephone Mr Murray at once,
but I'm sure neither Bates, nor we,

1224
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:42,460
~ can adequately express our
gratitude. ~ Thank you, m'Lord.

1225
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,620
I've spoken to Murray.

1226
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:55,210
He's certain there won't be a
problem once he has the statement.

1227
01:15:55,260 --> 01:15:58,010
~ Have you sent a message to Bates?
~ I can't decide.

1228
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,570
Tell him to come. When he's arrived,
contact Murray

1229
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,730
~ without saying where he is.
~ Poor old Murray.

1230
01:16:02,780 --> 01:16:05,810
We'll have him running a thieves'
kitchen before we're finished.

1231
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,410
~ Do you think they'll re-arrest Anna?
~ Murray says not.

1232
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,130
The witness who identified her is
having doubts.

1233
01:16:11,180 --> 01:16:13,730
The police know their case would be
shredded in court.

1234
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:16,450
Something else may turn up, but
until it does...

1235
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:20,540
They'll leave her at liberty. Well,
thank heaven.

1236
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:25,180
I can't stop thinking about Tom
leaving.

1237
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,330
I suppose there's no point in trying
to persuade him

1238
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:32,460
~ to let Sybbie stay.
~ No point at all.

1239
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,530
How are you feeling?

1240
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,090
Oh, better.

1241
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:39,730
Much better. Bored to sobs, but
better.

1242
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:43,170
Please be careful on Christmas Eve if
you do decide to drink.

1243
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:46,130
~ You'll get plastered on a sniff of
sherry. ~ Paradise.

1244
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:47,490
I'm serious.

1245
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:50,770
You can't make a fool of yourself in
front of the tenants.

1246
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:52,250
They'd be uncomfortable.

1247
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:55,530
I'm glad the picture sold so well, it
makes me feel better

1248
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,530
about spoiling it for you.

1249
01:16:57,580 --> 01:17:03,180
There is not now, nor ever will be,
anything you have spoiled for me.

1250
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:09,260
Well, don't spoil Christmas Eve for
me.

1251
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,460
Oh, my.

1252
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:25,690
Taste that, Mrs Hughes.

1253
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,010
Maybe you'll write a cookery book,
Daisy.

1254
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,850
Maybe that's where she's headed.

1255
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,730
Oh, I hope you change your mind
about your studies.

1256
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:35,250
Start the new year with a new
determination.

1257
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:37,650
I can't bear for it to go to waste.

1258
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,610
You're always complaining they keep
me from my work!

1259
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,770
~ You know I don't mean it!
~ Anything could happen for you.

1260
01:17:43,820 --> 01:17:45,610
~ It's a wonderful feeling.
~ Maybe.

1261
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:48,330
If it means a bit of extra work for
me, so be it!

1262
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:50,130
And happy Christmas!

1263
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:54,450
Why didn't you show it to me before
this? It's been months!

1264
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,690
Well, I've shown you now.

1265
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,970
You must know I resent Larry's
treatment of you very much.

1266
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:02,090
~ Things can never be good between us
again. ~ It will not involve me.

1267
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,210
~ Nothing will make you change
your mind? ~ I'm afraid not.

1268
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,170
But I will always think of you with
great affection

1269
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,410
~ and wish you nothing but the best.
~ That sounds more final

1270
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,100
than if you'd spat in my eye.

1271
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:17,250
I love you, Isobel Crawley!

1272
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,850
I know it's not enough.

1273
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,770
I know I'm old and played-out.

1274
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:24,690
But I do love you
with my whole heart.

1275
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,330
You're not played-out!

1276
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,930
And it means a great deal to me.

1277
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:31,650
But I will not poison
what years we have left

1278
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,770
by setting you against your
children.

1279
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,220
Oh.

1280
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,530
Have I interrupted a lovers' tryst?

1281
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:43,730
Ha! Thank you for injecting humour
into this moment of misery.

1282
01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:47,450
~ I-I must go.
~ Oh, dear. I've cut you short.

1283
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,780
Not really.

1284
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:51,500
There was nothing more to say.

1285
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,020
Goodbye.

1286
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:01,330
That was rather sad.

1287
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,020
Yes, it was sad.

1288
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:22,650
~ Are we guests or servants tonight?
~ Both, I should hope!

1289
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:25,530
I think we're as good as
the tenant farmers, thank you.

1290
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,930
Mr Barrow, Andrew, they're starting
to arrive.

1291
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:31,050
Mr Molesley can't manage on his own.
If you could bring up the food.

1292
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,810
Yes, Mr Carson. Take those.

1293
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,130
I wonder if I might have a word
later?

1294
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,420
~ If such a thing were possible.
~ It's possible. Let me know when.

1295
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,060
I thought it was a good moment,
while Mama has them all downstairs.

1296
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,660
What are you thinking?

1297
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:04,610
I'm taking photographs in my mind to
think of when I'm far away.

1298
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,420
Oh, Tom.

1299
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,930
I'm always ticking off Mary for
saying she doesn't want you to go,

1300
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,050
but... I hope you know
how much I'll miss you.

1301
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,170
I know how much I'll miss
all of you.

1302
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,810
And I suppose that must be pretty
similar.

1303
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:23,780
Great minds think alike.

1304
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,210
What do you say we take a moment to
think of Sybil?

1305
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,250
We're the three left on earth who
loved her the most.

1306
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,290
And Mama and Papa.

1307
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,250
~ But we're the three who should have
grown old with her. ~ That's true.

1308
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,740
And who knows when we'll be together
again?

1309
01:20:47,060 --> 01:20:48,620
Darling Sybil.

1310
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:56,620
Wherever you are...

1311
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:00,290
.. we send you all our love and kisses

1312
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:02,980
for the happiest of happy
Christmases.

1313
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:10,010
Sybbie's last Christmas in this
house -

1314
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:12,610
the house where she was born.

1315
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,500
Don't say that. We'll be back.

1316
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:21,490
You wouldn't consider leaving her
here until you'd settled in?

1317
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:22,980
No, I would not.

1318
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,130
No.

1319
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,580
But I love the way you love her.

1320
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,180
We must go down - they're arriving.

01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,550
Please, all of you, help yourselves
to a drink

1332
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,590
and have something to eat. You, too,
Molesley, Andrew.

1333
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:35,630
Anna, you-you-you have a drink. I
want everybody to have a drink.

1334
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:40,400
~ Some of us have already had a drink.
~ Don't be such a spoilsport.

1335
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,240
~ What do you think you're doing?
~ God, you are a dreary little man.

1336
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,430
~ Is everything going well here?
~ M'lady.

1337
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,070
~ Spratt?
~ Yes.

1338
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,320
Because I don't like dissension.

1339
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,670
Spratt, I won't have it.

1340
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:04,320
~ Dissension, m'Lady, perish the
thought. ~ Let's keep it that way.

1341
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:08,670
~ You look very dazed.
~ I am.

1342
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,790
You forget, I've never done
Christmas before.

1343
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:15,790
~ At least not properly. ~ Well, you're
in for the Downton Christmas.

1344
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,760
If that doesn't put you off, nothing
will.

1345
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:21,470
It's funny,

1346
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,830
it's finally beginning to sink in I
belong to two families.

1347
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,190
~ I'm a part of both.
~ Me, too. It's called being married.

1348
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,000
And I think it's just lovely.

1349
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,750
~ Don't let Mr Carson catch you.
~ He seems a kind man to me.

1350
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,030
He's a fair man, but I wouldn't put
it higher than that.

1351
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,600
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

1352
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:46,230
Thank you.

1353
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,320
Ooh. Close the door, for God's sake.

1354
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,870
Make them think they're not allowed
in.

1355
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,870
~ We can't stay for long - it's
cheating. ~ We have earned it.

1356
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:00,950
~ After the year we've had.
~ Oh, I know.

1357
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,640
Proposals and propositions.

1358
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,400
Not what one expects at our age.

1359
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,030
Oh, but I do wish you'd tell me the
truth about Princess Kuragin.

1360
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,070
You detest her,

1361
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,920
yet I've never known you fight for
anyone with more passion.

1362
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:22,240
I suppose they're in Paris now, so
what harm can it do?

1363
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,520
When I met the prince at the royal
wedding, we fell madly in love.

1364
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,870
And in the weeks that followed -
weeks of balls and midnight skating

1365
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,110
to the strains of the balalaika -
we resolved to elope.

1366
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,070
~ You know, to be free.
~ And what happened?

1367
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,510
Well, at the appointed hour,
we started for the port,

1368
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,480
to set sail in the prince's yacht,
but...

1369
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,990
.. my maid had betrayed us to the
princess,

1370
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,230
who set out in pursuit.

1371
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,510
She caught up with our carriage,
wrenched the door open

1372
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,790
and pulled me out.

1373
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,110
~ Pulled you out? By your arm?
~ Oh, by my arm, by my hair,

1374
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,150
by my leg, anything to get me out of
the coach.

1375
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:12,430
Then... she flung me into the cab
that brought her

1376
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,840
and sent me back to Lord Grantham.

1377
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,350
~ You must have looked rather
dishevelled. ~ Men notice nothing.

1378
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,280
~ So she saved you from ruin.
~ From ruin...

1379
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,910
.. from the loss of my children

1380
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,830
and from a life in the shadows.

1381
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,710
And you were grateful?

1382
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:35,150
Within a week, I felt she had pulled
me back from the brink of the abyss.

1383
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,430
And now, at last, you see,
we are even.

1384
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:39,920
She saved me.

1385
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:42,830
And I saved her.

1386
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:44,990
And you've never strayed again?

1387
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,870
~ I've never risked everything again.
~ It's not quite what I asked.

1388
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,910
It's all the answer you'll get.

1389
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,160
Remember, we were the Edwardians.

1390
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:58,950
What are you doing hiding in here?

1391
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,080
Quick! Come out. Chop, chop!

1392
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,830
~ I suppose you're all packed?
~ Pretty well.

1393
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,990
But you and I should go through
everything in my office.

1394
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,670
~ In fact, you should take it over.
~ I wouldn't know where to start.

1395
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,590
There's nothing I do you won't be
able to manage twice as well.

1396
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,390
Tom, Mary, you have to come. Robert's
about to give a speech

1397
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,990
~ and it is not a good idea.
~ It was bound to happen.

~ Ladies and gentlemen!

will let me speak for you

Let's toast your new house.

1420
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:59,150
Maybe I should mention one thing.

1421
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:04,590
You say...'your new house', but it
isn't only mine.

1422
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:07,230
~ No?
~ No.

1423
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:10,390
I've registered it in both of our
names.

1424
01:28:10,440 --> 01:28:11,790
I hope you don't mind,

1425
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,040
but I hate to change a plan when
there's no need.

1426
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,070
Mr Carson, I'm very appreciative,
really,

1427
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:23,640
~ but I can't accept.
~ Why not?

1428
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:29,230
Who knows what the future may hold?

1429
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,920
Or how much longer we'll even be
here?

1430
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:36,910
Suppose you want to... move away and
change your life entirely.

1431
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,030
You don't want to be stuck with me.

1432
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,910
But that's the point.

1433
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:43,600
What is?

1434
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:48,200
I do want to be stuck with you.

1435
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,750
I'm not convinced I can be hearing
this right.

1436
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:59,400
You are, if you think I'm asking you
to marry me.

1437
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:04,720
Well?

1438
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,880
Well...

1439
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,870
You could knock me down
with a feather.

1440
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,000
And you're not offended?

1441
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,160
Oh, Mr Carson,...

1442
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,430
.. I can assure you

1443
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:23,790
the very last thing in the world
that I am at this moment is offended.

1444
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,390
You can take as long as you like -
I won't press you.

1445
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:30,830
Because one thing I do know -

1446
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,120
I'm not marrying anyone else.

1447
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,400
Well, then.

1448
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,520
What exactly are we celebrating?

1449
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:52,110
We're celebrating the fact that I can
still get a proposal at my age.

1450
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,680
And that's... it?

1451
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:00,760
Of course I'll marry you,
you old booby.

1452
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,840
I thought you'd never ask.

1453
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:15,310
Hello, my darling.

1454
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,710
We're going to miss you very much,
my boy.

1455
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:20,200
Did I tell you? Very much.

1456
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,680
~ I suppose everyone's saying that.
~ Yes, they are.

1457
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,230
But it's not like you to be
sentimental.

1458
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,710
In vino veritas - 'from
wine comes truth'.

1459
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,200
The fact is, I've grown extremely
fond of you, Tom.

1460
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,960
Sybil would be amazed to hear it
but I have.

1461
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:42,680
Always remember you have a home to
come back to.

1462
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,360
Sybil will be very touched. As am I.

1463
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,680
And, yes, I will think of Downton as
my home.

1464
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:55,320
And that would have amazed Sybil,
I've no doubt about it.

1465
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,950
Now, what should Marigold call me?

1466
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,390
Donk!

1467
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:07,150
Why not? Everyone else does.

1468
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,070
She can call me Donk and every time
she does, I'll be reminded of you.

1469
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:14,670
Brava, Sybbie - that's a victory.

1470
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,910
~ Oh, is it time to sing?
~ No.

1471
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,960
No, I do have something to say.

1472
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:27,150
Ladies and gentlemen.

1473
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:31,790
My son-in-law, Mr Branson, asked for
your gratitude to me.

1474
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,990
Now, Her Ladyship and I should like
to repay the compliment.

1475
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:42,390
Tom Branson has helped Downton
navigate the choppy seas

1476
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:46,710
of the modern world and brought it
to the good place where it is now.

1477
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,190
But it is time for him to leave us.

1478
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:52,510
And while we regret his going,

1479
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:58,320
we wish him and Miss Sybbie well
in their new life.

1480
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,440
So, let us give a round of applause
as a send-off.

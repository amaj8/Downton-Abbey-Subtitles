2
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:44,427
Cora.
Hello, Rosamund.

3
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:46,507
You made good time.

4
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,307
I say!
What?

5
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:02,267
Some man has opened a nudist colony
at Wickford in Essex,

6
00:01:02,347 --> 00:01:03,747
called the Moonella Group.

7
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:06,387
What do you mean,
a man has opened a colony in Essex?

8
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,347
Not that sort of colony, Mama.

9
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:10,907
It's for people who want
to take all their clothes off.

10
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:14,147
In Essex? Isn't it terribly damp?

11
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:17,787
Would that make a difference?
Well, yes, if you had no clothes on.

12
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,627
Well, I think it's a mad idea.

13
00:01:19,707 --> 00:01:22,707
Oh, I doubt
they were aiming it at you.

14
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,747
I wanted to come after Mary told me
about the farmer's child

15
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:27,867
you're taking such an interest in.

16
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:30,147
Come to my room when you're changed.

17
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:33,467
How long are you here for?
About a week, if I'm allowed.

18
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:36,587
Good. We're giving a bash
for my Deputy Lieutenants on Friday.

19
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,067
You can stay and help.

20
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,347
I'm afraid I'll be away
on Thursday night.

21
00:01:40,427 --> 00:01:42,907
It's another of my Lord Loot things.

22
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:47,067
I'm guest of honour at a dinner for all
the Yorkshire-based commanding officers.

23
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,307
You're staying the night?
It's in Sheffield,

24
00:01:49,387 --> 00:01:52,067
and it'll be very late,
so it seems sensible.

25
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,027
You'll just have to make do
with Cora.

26
00:01:54,107 --> 00:01:56,107
And Edith and Tom and Rose.

27
00:01:57,147 --> 00:01:59,787
What news of your suitor?

28
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,587
I haven't heard from him lately.

29
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:05,147
Have you decided what answer
you're going to give him yet?

30
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:08,547
Well, I think I should tell him
before I tell you. Wouldn't you agree?

31
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:12,787
Ellen Terry has nothing on you when
it comes to stringing out a moment.

32
00:02:16,027 --> 00:02:18,787
Oh, are you busy?
No, no, no. Come in.

33
00:02:18,867 --> 00:02:20,747
How can I help?

34
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,707
Would you like me to leave?

35
00:02:22,787 --> 00:02:27,787
Oh, I'd love to think I had a secret
that was too indelicate
for a lady's ear, but I haven't.

36
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:31,187
No, I've got some good news,
for a change.

37
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:33,427
An old aunt's died.

38
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:36,547
No, that's not the good news,
but she made old bones.

39
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:38,867
Which is the main thing.
Well, the point is,

40
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,627
she's left me a bit of money.

41
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:43,747
Ah. It's a few hundred quid,
more than I've ever saved.

42
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,427
I am glad for you.

43
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:49,187
Well, she was married to a baker
and he did well, but they had no children.

44
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:50,907
How nice of her to choose you.

45
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,787
Well, I think it was in memory
of my dad, more than anything.

46
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,667
She and he were very close -

47
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:59,387
And you want my advice on what to do
with the inheritance? Is that it?

48
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:00,667
It is.

49
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,267
You'd do better asking Mr Branson's
advice. Or Dr Clarkson's.

50
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:06,227
She's asking mine.

51
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:08,947
But we live so out of the way here.

52
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:11,387
You need to talk to someone
who's still in the game.

53
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:13,307
I'll give it some thought,
Mrs Patmore.

54
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:18,587
And now, if you'll allow me,
I will go up and ring the gong.

55
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:24,827
Come and sit here and we can talk.

56
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:26,867
I'm not going to eat you.

57
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,547
But you are going to chew me up.

58
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:32,907
Why not just tell me about
the dear little farmer's daughter?

59
00:03:32,987 --> 00:03:35,667
What did Mary say?
No more than that.

60
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:39,907
You knew I'd bring her back.

61
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,867
I feared it.

62
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:45,307
And I still feel very sorry
for poor Mrs Schroder.

63
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:48,627
I wrote to her. She told me
she's adopted another baby.

64
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,027
Then she has solved her problem,

65
00:03:51,107 --> 00:03:54,147
but the question remains:
have you solved yours?

66
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:59,507
Am I at least going to be allowed
to see the girl?

67
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,867
Do you want to?
Of course.

68
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:06,027
I gave up ten months of my life to
make sure she came safely into the world.

69
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:11,107
The trouble is, the farmer's wife,
Mrs Drewe,

70
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:13,787
she just thinks I'm a nuisance.

71
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,707
She doesn't want me to see Marigold.

72
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:22,267
So, we have a situation of infinite
danger to your reputation,

73
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:26,307
which brings you no emotional reward
to compensate.

74
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:34,147
Are we the first down?
It looks like it. Want some?

75
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:36,107
Mmm.

76
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:39,667
How is Miss Bunting?
Still teaching Daisy downstairs?

77
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:42,227
She is. But don't worry.

78
00:04:42,307 --> 00:04:44,627
I won't ask her to join us
in the future.

79
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:48,827
Cora would overrule me in a moment
if she thought it important to you.

80
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:50,467
Which you don't think it should be?

81
00:04:50,547 --> 00:04:55,147
I know you feel excluded at times,
an outsider in your own home.

82
00:04:55,227 --> 00:04:59,747
Look, I am very grateful to you
and this family.

83
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:03,227
But my vision of this country
is different from yours.

84
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:04,907
But not from Miss Bunting's?

85
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:08,587
I believe in reform
and the moral direction of the Left,

86
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,267
and when I'm with her,
I don't feel like a freak or a fool,

87
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,387
devoid of common sense.

88
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,147
I would only say this, Tom:

89
00:05:15,227 --> 00:05:18,987
In your time here you've learned
both sides of the argument,

90
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,267
befriended people
you'd once have seen as enemies.

91
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:24,587
That's true.
You should be proud.

92
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:28,307
Five years ago, would you have believed
you could be friendly with my mother?

93
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:31,787
I'm not sure I'd have
believed it five minutes ago.

94
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,907
Don't make nothing
of what you've achieved. That's all.

95
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:39,587
Drinks before dinner?
Wait till Carson catches you.

96
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:42,107
You'll notice I poured them myself.

97
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:50,467
Anna, I've had a note
from Sergeant Willis.

98
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:54,187
He says he's going to look in
this morning at 11 o'clock.

99
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,147
To see me?
That's what he says.

100
00:05:56,227 --> 00:05:58,467
Anyone else, Mr Carson?
I'm not sure.

101
00:05:58,547 --> 00:06:00,987
He says he wants to talk
to Anna and Lady Mary.

102
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,307
Lady Mary? Why her?

103
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:06,227
I don't know.
But could you warn her?

104
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:08,907
I'll tell her
when I take up the breakfast tray.

105
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:13,787
May I ask... to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

106
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,867
I'll get straight down to it.

107
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,027
You know how Lord Merton likes to...

108
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:22,587
display his interest
in all things medical?

109
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:27,707
At least, he likes to,
when in the company of Mrs Crawley.

110
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,507
Your confidence is a compliment.

111
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:33,467
I confide in you, Dr Clarkson,
because I must.

112
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:36,027
Only you can help.

113
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:40,787
That is more flattering still.
It's the family's fault, really.

114
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:46,027
We've trained her in our ways, and the
earnest and intellectual 'bonne bourgeoise'

115
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:51,587
has been replaced by...
a rather less definable figure.

116
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,187
Are you saying you liked her better
when she was more middle-class?

117
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:58,467
No, I wouldn't go that far.
But you understood her better.

118
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:01,627
Precisely.
Now I do not know who she is.

119
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,467
I do not know what it is she wants.

120
00:07:03,547 --> 00:07:06,267
Well, there are many who wouldn't
be puzzled by the desire

121
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:09,307
to marry a lord
and live in a palace.

122
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,187
Can I ask you a personal question?

123
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,547
I've lived through great wars
and my share of grief.

124
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:19,467
I think I can manage an impertinent
question from a doctor.

125
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:24,907
Do you perhaps resent the idea of a
change of position for Mrs Crawley?

126
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,227
I'm sorry.
I do not quite grasp your question.

127
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:30,107
It bewilders me.

128
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:32,827
But I will say this:

129
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,787
Do you wish to see her live a life

130
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,187
devoid of industry and moral worth?

131
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,947
I do not.
And when the glitter is tarnished,

132
00:07:42,027 --> 00:07:44,027
you know, what then?

133
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:48,547
A hollow existence
in a large and draughty house,

134
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:51,587
with a man who bores her to death.

135
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,747
It's a terrible prospect.
So our duty is clear.

136
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,467
Oh... It's you, m'lady.

137
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:07,187
Yes. I wanted to bring my aunt
to meet Marigold.

138
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:11,067
This is Lady Rosamund Painswick.
May I introduce Mrs Drewe?

139
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:15,587
How do you do, Mrs Drewe?
We're sorry for dropping in like
this. I expect you're very busy.

140
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,267
I am busy, m'lady, yes.

141
00:08:18,347 --> 00:08:20,547
This is Marigold.

142
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:24,027
Oh, I do see. She's very sweet.

143
00:08:24,107 --> 00:08:26,107
Lady Edith seems to think so.

144
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,947
Hello.

145
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:34,267
Lady Edith has decided to show off
the baby to her aunt.

146
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,227
Lady Rosamund Painswick.
Pleased to meet you, m'lady.

147
00:08:37,307 --> 00:08:39,147
Well, we don't want
to disturb your day.

148
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,427
I've got to get the dinner started.

149
00:08:41,507 --> 00:08:43,507
Yes, of course.

150
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,427
Goodbye, dear.

151
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:50,147
Remember your...
Remember your friend, Rosamund.

152
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:53,507
I should take her inside.

153
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:55,587
Oh, I could always -
I'll take her.

154
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,187
Of course.

155
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:06,707
Goodbye.

156
00:09:10,947 --> 00:09:12,587
Well?

157
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,947
It's exactly
what I said would happen.

158
00:09:15,027 --> 00:09:16,707
She wants Marigold as her toy,

159
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,867
to be poked and prodded by every
stray guest from the big house!

160
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,947
And you've done this.
You've done it!

161
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,347
What did you mean
by saying to Mrs Patmore

162
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:29,947
we were living our lives
out of the way, not in the game?

163
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,387
Well, we are.

164
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,387
Why does everyone talk as if
we don't live in the modern world?

165
00:09:34,467 --> 00:09:37,067
You don't agree with that, then?
No.

166
00:09:37,147 --> 00:09:40,227
Does the King not live in the world
of today?

167
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:42,787
Does Mr Sargent not paint
modern pictures?

168
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:45,947
Does Mr Kipling not write
modern books?

169
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:52,947
So, what are you going to tell her?
I don't know yet. I shall consider.

170
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,587
Sergeant Willis is asking for you,
Mr Carson.

171
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,627
He's got a man with him
from London, he says.

172
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:07,027
They're in the library now.
They?

173
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,867
An Inspector's come
from Scotland Yard.

174
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:12,307
What does he want with me?

175
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:15,667
What does he want with any of us?
None of it makes any sense.

176
00:10:19,427 --> 00:10:22,187
By the way, I'd like to catch
the ten-o'clock train tomorrow.

177
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:25,627
I'm dining with Mr Blake
and I don't want to be in a rush.

178
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:27,907
Will we stay at Lady Rosamund's?

179
00:10:27,987 --> 00:10:30,667
She doesn't mind. She's told Mead.

180
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:34,507
Will you see Lord Gillingham?
I don't think so.

181
00:10:34,587 --> 00:10:36,587
So you haven't changed your mind?

182
00:10:38,227 --> 00:10:40,627
Right. Let's get this over with.

183
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:48,867
Have I finished us off
before we ever really got started?

184
00:10:48,947 --> 00:10:51,587
You've pitted yourself against them
from the start.

185
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:53,547
How can you retreat
from that position?

186
00:10:53,627 --> 00:10:55,707
You mean I've made it 'them or me'?

187
00:10:55,787 --> 00:10:58,107
Haven't you?

188
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:01,867
You despise the family, but I think
you forget my wife was one of them.

189
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:03,787
My child IS one of them.

190
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:05,547
Where does that leave me?

191
00:11:05,627 --> 00:11:08,387
Don't you despise them? Really?

192
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,467
No, I don't.

193
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:15,667
I'd like things to change, but I don't think
in black-and-white terms any more.

194
00:11:15,747 --> 00:11:17,907
While I do?
Look, I'm not going to pretend

195
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,267
I haven't enjoyed knowing you.

196
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,467
In fact, I'm relieved to know I'm
not the only Socialist left on this earth.

197
00:11:26,827 --> 00:11:30,987
But maybe we should call it a day,
before one of us gets hurt.

198
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,846
I don't know what else to add,
Mr Vyner.

199
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,646
I remember we had to race
to catch the train.

200
00:11:51,726 --> 00:11:54,726
I'd had lunch with Lord Gillingham
and I needed to get home,

201
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,405
as the church fete was planned
for the following day.

202
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,205
And it was during the fete
that Lord Gillingham arrived

203
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,005
with the news of Mr Green's death?

204
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,086
That's right. And I told Anna.

205
00:12:04,165 --> 00:12:05,485
Hmm.

206
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:08,045
Was it a great surprise?

207
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,445
I think I would have
called it a shock.

208
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,165
She was very shocked.

209
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,085
Was she? Was she, indeed?

210
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:20,805
Can I go now? I think Lady Mary
has given what help she can.

211
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,685
Erm... will you confirm
that Mrs Bates was in London

212
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:26,925
on the morning that Mr Green died
and that you don't know where?

213
00:12:27,005 --> 00:12:29,045
I only have to ask her.

214
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,365
Secondly,
you have no reason to believe

215
00:12:31,445 --> 00:12:34,125
that Bates was anywhere
further south than York?

216
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:36,205
No reason at all.

217
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:44,085
I think they'd enjoy
getting to know each other better.

218
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:47,485
I think it's a nice idea,
but shouldn't I do it, for once?

219
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:49,685
I always seem to be taking luncheon
off you.

220
00:12:49,765 --> 00:12:51,365
No, I'd rather.

221
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,405
You see, Mrs Potter likes
to have people to cook for.

222
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:58,765
And Spratt needs something
to occupy his mind.

223
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,525
Oh?

224
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:05,725
We both have an inkling that my maid
Collins is on the way out.

225
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:09,365
Oh, I do hope not.
No, I don't mean she's dying.

226
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,645
I mean she's on her way
out of my house.

227
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,525
She keeps talking
about her mother being infirm.

228
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:18,085
But I'm infirm.
Why doesn't she think about that?

229
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,165
You're as infirm as Windsor Castle.

230
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:24,045
And why does Spratt mind,
particularly?

231
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,285
Because he likes things
to be just so.

232
00:13:27,365 --> 00:13:32,725
But also,
I think Collins was his creature

233
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:35,405
and does his bidding
without qualm or query.

234
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:37,645
He can't be sure of that
in the next one.

235
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:42,085
Well, never having had a lady's maid, it's
not a challenge I've had to tussle with.

236
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:45,125
But you'll come on Thursday?
I will.

237
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:47,685
I think it would be nice
for Doctor Clarkson

238
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:50,685
to see beyond Lord Merton's
position and get to know the man.

239
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,485
I agree.

240
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,765
Oh!
I knew I had something to tell you.

241
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:01,365
Shrimpie thinks he may be
on the trail of Princess Kuragin.

242
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,005
Oh, I am pleased.

243
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:08,245
Yes, he's heard a rumour of some
Russian nurses working in...

244
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,445
Wan... Wan Chai?

245
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:13,365
And that's in Hong Kong?
Well, nearby, I think.

246
00:14:13,445 --> 00:14:15,885
Well, it sounds much better
than it might have been.

247
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:19,525
Yes. The idea of Princess Irina
scrubbing the sick

248
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:22,765
and emptying bedpans
is a cheering one.

249
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:27,325
Will you tell her husband? No,
I'll wait until Shrimpie is certain.

250
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:30,845
These things
must be managed carefully.

251
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,925
Yes.

252
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,325
Sounds as if this must be managed
very carefully.

253
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:43,885
Why did Mr Carson try to hide
that you were in London on that day?

254
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:46,685
I don't think he tried to hide
anything. He just forgot.

255
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,205
Isn't it a big thing when a member
of the staff goes to London?

256
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:52,885
Not for a lady's maid.
Mrs Hughes, please.

257
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:56,285
She's right. It's not a big thing
for ladies' maids or valets.

258
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,045
I'm going tomorrow with Lady Mary.

259
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,125
And you liked Mr Green?

260
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:04,005
Yes. I did. Very much.

261
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:05,725
He wasn't so fond of your husband.

262
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,085
Well,
there's no accounting for taste.

263
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,725
Don't go away, Mrs Bates.

264
00:15:11,805 --> 00:15:14,245
You've said you'll be in London.
I've no objection.

265
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,325
But don't go away.

266
00:15:21,165 --> 00:15:25,525
I'm very sorry, My Lord.
I wonder if you know when we can
get in here and lay the table.

267
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,205
The police have taken over the
library, and I needed to spread these out.

268
00:15:29,285 --> 00:15:33,205
What are they for? I'm trying to
formulate my plans for the village,

269
00:15:33,285 --> 00:15:35,165
and I'm looking into some builders.

270
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:37,405
You won't use
the ordinary maintenance team?

271
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,045
It would be beyond them.

272
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,925
Have you made your choice?

273
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,485
I'll have to talk to Lady Mary,
but I like the look of this outfit.

274
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:51,405
They're based in Thirsk, so they're
local, and their work is excellent.

275
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,565
Of course,
we should all invest in building.

276
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:56,485
Fortunes will be made
over the next few years.

277
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,165
Why don't I hold the bags,
while you do that?

278
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:10,805
Oh, that's frightfully nice of you!
Are you sure?

279
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,885
Quite sure.

280
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:22,525
Erm... I can have them back now.
I shouldn't dream of it.

281
00:16:22,605 --> 00:16:24,125
Where are you going?

282
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:26,205
Erm... just to St Mary Magdalene's.

283
00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:30,245
You must have a very sweet tooth!

284
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,885
No, they're not for me.

285
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:38,445
I give tea to some Russian refugees
every Tuesday and Thursday. They love cake.

286
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:41,845
I love cake.
Oh, come and have some, if you like.

287
00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:54,445
Are you interested in Russia?
Not terribly...

288
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:56,285
although I am very sorry
for them all.

289
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:57,725
Of course.

290
00:16:57,805 --> 00:16:59,565
I should be more interested, really.

291
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,565
Why?
I have a bit of Russian blood.

292
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:05,245
How extraordinary!
It's true.

293
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:09,045
In a way, my family is Russian.
Or, at least, they used to be.

294
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,285
Well, now I insist.
Come and have some tea.

295
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,805
By way of a thank-you.

296
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:18,085
I suppose we ought to introduce
ourselves, even if it feels funny.

297
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,005
Erm... Rose MacClare.

298
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:22,765
Atticus Aldridge, at your service.

299
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:24,525
That doesn't sound very Russian.

300
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:26,765
Well, we weren't called Aldridge
back then.

301
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:38,605
Mrs Patmore, I think I may have
a solution to your problem.

302
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,045
Oh, that's good to hear.

303
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,605
Why not invest
in the building trade?

304
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:46,485
With the expansion that's going on
everywhere, you'd soon see a good return.

305
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,805
Oh. Well, that's a thought.

306
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:50,965
Had you any special firm in mind?

307
00:17:51,045 --> 00:17:53,485
What about WP Moss?

308
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:58,885
They're based in Thirsk, they're expanding,
and I hear their name everywhere.

309
00:17:58,965 --> 00:18:01,965
I expect you keep your ear to
the ground about that sort of thing.

310
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:05,165
I like to keep abreast
of what's going on in the world.

311
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:10,805
So, can you buy shares in WP Moss?
I mean, have they gone public?

312
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:14,565
Well, erm...
you'll have to make enquiries.

313
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:20,245
Miss Bunting? I must confess
I am surprised to see you here.

314
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:22,765
Rest easy, Mr Carson.
I've come to say goodbye.

315
00:18:22,845 --> 00:18:24,565
She's leaving the school, isn't she?

316
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,965
She's leaving the school
and the village, because Mr Branson
won't stand up to His Lordship.

317
00:18:29,045 --> 00:18:31,365
You are nudging impertinence, Daisy.

318
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:35,085
I should think carefully
before you say one more word.

319
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:36,645
Are you going? Honestly?

320
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:40,805
I am, but the situation's
not quite as Daisy recounted it.

321
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,365
We already knew that.

322
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:45,965
I've had an offer, from a school
in Preston, in Lancashire.

323
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:49,325
A grammar school, no less,
so it's quite a step up.

324
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:52,605
I dithered a bit,
but I've decided to accept.

325
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,885
Because she gets insulted
when she comes here.

326
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:58,965
I am sure Miss Bunting is given
the reception she deserves.

327
00:18:59,045 --> 00:19:01,085
Mrs Patmore...

328
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:05,405
Don't let Daisy give up her studies.
She's got potential.

329
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,645
What's going on here?
All sorts.

330
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,605
Mr Carson's giving me investment advice
and Miss Bunting's leaving Downton,

331
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,965
because Mr Branson
won't stick up for her.

332
00:19:14,045 --> 00:19:16,045
Well, that seems to cover it.

333
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,445
I'll be in my room.

334
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,725
Well, goodbye... and good luck.

335
00:19:25,845 --> 00:19:27,845
Goodbye.

336
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:34,965
Ah, Mrs Hughes.
Who is this Mr Vyner?

337
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:39,765
He's the London detective,
looking into the death of Mr Green.

338
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:43,445
Why do they keep questioning
Mr and Mrs Bates?

339
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:45,125
Who says they do?

340
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:47,165
This house has no secrets.

341
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:49,885
Then I suggest you ask Mr Vyner.

342
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,925
I may just do that.

343
00:19:52,005 --> 00:19:55,445
Who knows?
I might have something to tell him.

344
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:57,165
Don't make trouble, Mr Barrow.

345
00:19:57,245 --> 00:19:59,965
Are you saying
I shouldn't do my duty, Mrs Hughes?

346
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:03,005
No.
I'm asking you not to make trouble.

347
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,525
Are you quite well? You look
as if you could do with a lie down.

348
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,605
Don't worry about me.

349
00:20:12,005 --> 00:20:15,325
Who was that on the telephone?
Simon Bricker.

350
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:17,285
Oh, God. What did he want?

351
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,605
I shall answer
without commenting on your tone.

352
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,165
He wants the picture photographed
for his book.

353
00:20:22,245 --> 00:20:25,445
When is this? He comes tomorrow and
they take the pictures on Friday.

354
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:28,645
Well, you know I won't be here.
I've got the dinner in Sheffield.

355
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,285
Since you don't like him,
I don't see that as a drawback.

356
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:34,205
And Mary's in London.
What difference does that make?

357
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:37,045
It's not that I dislike him, exactly.

358
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,325
It's that this business
has been dragging on.

359
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,725
Robert, it's a compliment.
By referencing our painting in his book,

360
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:45,405
he'll increase its value,
maybe by a lot. Is that so bad?

361
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,405
You're not forbidden
from inviting him.

362
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,765
Good, because I already have.

363
00:20:57,485 --> 00:20:59,485
Mr Branson, sir.

364
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,885
Hello, Daisy. What can I do for you?

365
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,805
You can do something for yourself. You're
making the biggest mistake of your life.

366
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:12,085
Is this Miss Bunting, by any chance?
She's an extraordinary person.

367
00:21:12,165 --> 00:21:13,765
Clever and kind.

368
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:17,205
She's all of those things.
Then why turn your back on her?

369
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,445
Daisy -
I mean it.

370
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:23,005
She's leaving tomorrow,
but I know she loves you.

371
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:24,645
I can tell when she speaks of you.

372
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:26,405
She's leaving tomorrow? For good?

373
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,965
Won't you stop her?
You're not a Crawley.

374
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:31,125
You belong with us.

375
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,165
We're the future. They're the past.

376
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:35,645
Well, I can hear her voice in that.
Daisy?

377
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,765
What are you doing here?

378
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:41,205
She was checking something
in the dining room. I held her up.

379
00:21:41,285 --> 00:21:43,285
Get back downstairs immediately.

380
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:48,045
Mr Carson.

381
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:53,063
Have any of you heard of someone
called Atticus Aldridge?

382
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:55,903
He sounds like the hero of a novel
by Mrs Humphrey Ward.

383
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:59,542
I'm not sure. Any more clues?
I met him today. In York.

384
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:02,662
Marsha George told me his father's
been made Lord Sinderby.

385
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:04,622
Now, wait a minute. I remember this.

386
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:09,102
When the title was created, the locals were
furious, but now I can't remember why.

387
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:13,182
Perhaps because Sinderby's a Yorkshire
village and they'd only just bought a house.

388
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:16,662
Canningford Grange.
Oh! Have the Wheelers sold up?

389
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:19,342
You knew that. I told you.
What does My Lord Sinderby do?

390
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,182
Oh, I think he's a banker.

391
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:24,262
I don't know, really,
but the son's nice.

392
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,462
Oh... nothing like that!

393
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:31,262
Barrow, are you quite well?

394
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:33,542
Carson,
have you been over-working him?

395
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:35,782
Not that I'm aware, Your Ladyship.

396
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:38,182
Mr Barrow, am I ill-treating you?

397
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:42,222
You are the soul of kindness,
Mr Carson. Thank you, Mr Barrow.

398
00:22:42,302 --> 00:22:44,062
I'm looking forward to your party.

399
00:22:44,142 --> 00:22:47,302
It's very daring of the Lord
Lieutenant to give a cocktail party.

400
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,662
Carson, what do you think?

401
00:22:49,742 --> 00:22:53,782
Well, I agree with Carson.
It seems very fast to me.

402
00:22:53,862 --> 00:22:56,662
Well, I love cocktail parties.
Me too.

403
00:22:56,742 --> 00:23:00,662
You only have to stay 40 minutes,
instead of sitting for seven courses,

404
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:04,622
between a deaf landowner
and an even deafer Major General.

405
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:07,982
Even so, they'll say you're not
doing things 'properly' any more.

406
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:10,302
Do you care what people think?
Yes.

407
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:13,182
I accept change,
but I want to navigate it gently.

408
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:16,982
I don't want to leap into it
and put everyone's backs up.

409
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,262
But why do the rituals, the clothes
and the customs, matter so much?

410
00:23:20,342 --> 00:23:23,702
Because, without them, we would be
like the Wild Men of Borneo.

411
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:28,142
I disagree. Manners and tradition
are all very well,

412
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:32,062
but once they start to control us,
they've outlived their usefulness.

413
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,622
Well, there are more important
things to worry about

414
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:37,502
than whether or not Carson
minds serving cocktails.

415
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,622
Why is Carson in the line of fire?
What's he done wrong?

416
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:45,022
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Mama.
I've rather a headache.

417
00:23:47,942 --> 00:23:52,142
What was that about? Rosamund,
you spent the afternoon together.

418
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,262
Did Edith say
anything was bothering her?

419
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:57,742
Oh, she's just very tired.
She'll be fit as a flea tomorrow.

420
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:10,462
That's nice of you.
I'll just let Mr Carson know.

421
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:13,022
Oh, could you leave it,
for a moment?

422
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:16,422
He's given me his view,
about my money.

423
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:19,702
He says I should put it
into a building firm, WP Moss,

424
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:23,262
or, if not them, then into some
other building opportunity.

425
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:26,542
And you don't want to?
It's not that, exactly.

426
00:24:26,622 --> 00:24:28,502
But I don't know about building,

427
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:31,542
and I don't like to put money
into something I don't understand.

428
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:35,462
Then why did you ask him?
Because he's a man, I suppose.

429
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,262
I'm not sure
that's a good enough reason.

430
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,182
Nor am I now.

431
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:42,662
But I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

432
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:47,262
I wish men worried about our feelings a
quarter as much as we worry about theirs.

433
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,262
You seem very thoughtful.

434
00:24:52,342 --> 00:24:55,102
I'm on the brink of a decision.

435
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:57,262
I just hope it's the right one.

436
00:24:57,342 --> 00:24:59,302
Well, I won't ask what it's about.

437
00:24:59,382 --> 00:25:04,222
But remember, Tom - make the right
choice for you and not for us.

438
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,102
You know, you're much nicer
than a lot of people realise.

439
00:25:07,182 --> 00:25:09,302
Not always. Good night.

440
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,382
Good night.

441
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,022
I don't know what you mean, Mama.

442
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,622
You question my motives
every time I come here.

443
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,462
It's as if I weren't welcome.

444
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:26,782
Just tell me: what were you and Edith
discussing in such a huddle?

445
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:29,342
Well, it is very hard -

446
00:25:29,422 --> 00:25:33,622
Rosamund, you are addressing
your mother, not the committee
of the Women's Institute.

447
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:37,182
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing,

448
00:25:37,262 --> 00:25:38,982
which is quite wrong, you know.

449
00:25:39,062 --> 00:25:42,582
It's about the child, isn't it?
That is the secret you share.

450
00:25:43,702 --> 00:25:47,582
We both know you are not leaving
my house until I learn the truth.

451
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:51,862
So, shall I have a bed made up for you
here, or are you going to tell me now?

452
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:03,182
Mr Drewe... I have to see her.

453
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:09,382
It was a mistake
to bring your aunt here.

454
00:26:09,462 --> 00:26:12,502
Margie feels that you want the child
to be your plaything.

455
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:14,582
How can she say that?

456
00:26:16,142 --> 00:26:18,982
The fact is, I was wrong.

457
00:26:19,062 --> 00:26:22,022
She won't have you here,
not any more.

458
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:23,662
You must leave us alone.

459
00:26:23,742 --> 00:26:27,782
If you don't stop coming, she'll make
me give up the farm and move away.

460
00:26:30,102 --> 00:26:31,982
But what about Marigold?

461
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:33,902
What do you mean? We'd take her.

462
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,982
But you can't. I won't allow it.

463
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:40,782
What would you suggest?

464
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:44,222
We bring her up to the Abbey
and leave her in the library?

465
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:47,422
I'm very sorry, m'lady.
It's not what I planned.

466
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:51,382
But I see no way round it.

467
00:27:08,342 --> 00:27:11,822
People always think how healthy we
must be, living out in the country,

468
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:14,102
but the water's not as good
as it might be.

469
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:16,942
You mean the iodine deficiency?
I do.

470
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:18,822
I suppose you must get
a lot of goitres.

471
00:27:18,902 --> 00:27:20,862
Er... quite a lot, yes.

472
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:24,382
It's sad so few people know
that the treatment is just iodine.

473
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:26,582
Too many suffer
when the solution is simple.

474
00:27:26,662 --> 00:27:29,422
You've studied this?
I've just read a lot.

475
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:32,222
I wish I had studied it.

476
00:27:34,022 --> 00:27:35,942
Luncheon is served, m'lady.

477
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,542
Do cheer up, Spratt.

478
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:41,462
Spratt is downcast,
because it is as I feared.

479
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:44,302
Collins has handed in her notice.

480
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:47,662
You don't like change, Spratt?
I detest it, madam.

481
00:27:47,742 --> 00:27:49,662
Well, we all hate change, Spratt,

482
00:27:49,742 --> 00:27:51,822
but we have to learn to live with it.

483
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,302
I don't hate change.
I find it exciting.

484
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:58,422
Remember - those customs
and ceremonies that people think
are the soul of England

485
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,622
were almost all invented
by the Victorians.

486
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:02,622
Quite right.

487
00:28:02,702 --> 00:28:06,422
The truth is, they're well suited,
whether we like it or not.

488
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:09,422
And I don't believe he's faking
his interest in medicine.

489
00:28:09,502 --> 00:28:11,502
I'm afraid I agree with you.

490
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,222
You must be off soon.

491
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:18,582
I'm just going to put him
in his uniform, and then we'll go.

492
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:23,942
You never told me
what the Inspector wanted yesterday.

493
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,942
Mainly because I'm not sure.

494
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:32,382
He asked me if I liked Mr Green
and why he didn't like you.

495
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,982
And what did you say?

496
00:28:35,062 --> 00:28:37,382
I said I don't know, because I don't.

497
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:43,702
I promise you this.

498
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,982
Nothing bad is ever going to happen
to you again.

499
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:53,022
I hope that's true.
We'll sit by the fire,

500
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:56,022
with all our children around us,

501
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,462
and I'll make certain
that you are safe.

502
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,862
I wonder.

503
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:06,102
We both want it so much, but do you
believe it'll really happen?

504
00:29:06,182 --> 00:29:08,622
I do. With all my heart.

505
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:16,222
Actually, I'm not sure about having
children 'all around us'.

506
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,902
How many are you planning on,
Mr Bates?

507
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:37,662
You nearly missed me.
You never told me you were going.

508
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:41,022
Who did?
Daisy.

509
00:29:41,102 --> 00:29:43,262
My champion.

510
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,862
The school must be sorry.
Maybe.

511
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:49,662
I think I was rather a nuisance,
but I hope they'll miss me a bit.

512
00:29:51,182 --> 00:29:53,942
I hope you'll miss me a bit.

513
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:56,022
I'll miss you a lot.

514
00:29:57,422 --> 00:29:59,422
I've loved you, you know.

515
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:03,582
I could have loved you more
if you'd let me.

516
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:07,702
I'm glad we met.

517
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:10,502
You've reminded me of who I am,
and I'm grateful.

518
00:30:11,702 --> 00:30:13,822
And I won't lose touch with that
again.

519
00:30:20,262 --> 00:30:23,902
But I wish we'd met
before you ever knew them.

520
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,822
We need to get started, if you're
to catch the four o'clock, miss.

521
00:30:28,902 --> 00:30:30,902
Let me.

522
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:02,022
Did you have a nice journey?
Excellent.

523
00:31:02,102 --> 00:31:04,102
Thank you very much.

524
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:14,782
Hello, Lord Grantham.
You look very splendid.

525
00:31:14,862 --> 00:31:17,302
We're ships that pass in the night,
Mr Bricker.

526
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:19,942
I have to go to Sheffield,
but I'll see you tomorrow,

527
00:31:20,022 --> 00:31:21,702
if you're still here when I get back.

528
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:23,782
Goodbye, Cora.

529
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:31,662
So, here we are again.

530
00:31:31,742 --> 00:31:34,462
I'm beginning to find Downton
quite home-like.

531
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,982
Good. You're very welcome.

532
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,062
As long as you behave.

533
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,662
What are you doing here?

534
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:04,062
In search of more cake?

535
00:32:04,142 --> 00:32:08,622
I wanted to see you again,
before I went up to London
to start my new job at the bank.

536
00:32:08,702 --> 00:32:12,062
Do you think I should buy
a bowler hat?

537
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:17,622
Let me introduce you. Prince Kuragin,
Count Rostov, this is Mr Aldridge.

538
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:19,862
I'm Mr Kuragin here.

539
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:25,942
Have you heard from Aunt Violet yet?
Even if your father finds her,

540
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,382
what happens next? To any of us.

541
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:31,542
We are strangers in a strange land.

542
00:32:31,622 --> 00:32:34,102
Talk to Mr Aldridge.

543
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:35,902
His family were Russian,

544
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:39,542
but they've started a new life
in England, and so can you.

545
00:32:39,622 --> 00:32:42,302
Where did they come from?

546
00:32:42,382 --> 00:32:44,382
Odessa.

547
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,942
His great-grandfather
came with some of them in 1859.

548
00:32:48,022 --> 00:32:50,102
See? I do remember what I'm told.

549
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:53,702
And then the rest of the family
followed in - 1871.

550
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:56,142
How brilliant! That's right.

551
00:32:58,222 --> 00:33:00,982
He is not Russian.
Nikolai. Nye nado.

552
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,382
No, he's not Russian now, but -

553
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:05,622
They were not Russian then!

554
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:09,542
I'm sorry about that.

555
00:33:09,622 --> 00:33:11,462
Nikolai, podozhdi!

556
00:33:12,942 --> 00:33:15,822
I don't understand.

557
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:19,262
Erm...
I think he said we're not Russian,

558
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:22,382
because we're... we're Jewish.

559
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,022
Well, how did he know?

560
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:31,702
There were two big pogroms to drive out
the Jews from Odessa, one in 1859...

561
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,782
And 1871?

562
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,062
But it's still odd.

563
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,982
I mean, you're English now,
but you're still Jewish.

564
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,062
What's the difference?

565
00:33:46,502 --> 00:33:49,582
Would you let me give you dinner
when you're in London?

566
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:53,462
I might.

567
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:55,542
We'll have to see.

568
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,542
What a treat. I haven't been
to Simpson's for ages.

569
00:34:02,622 --> 00:34:04,222
We'll go straight to the table.

570
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:06,942
I've asked a friend to join us,
and I want you to behave.

571
00:34:07,022 --> 00:34:09,022
Why wouldn't I?

572
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:18,542
Goodness. I wasn't expecting you.

573
00:34:18,622 --> 00:34:21,302
Ditto.
I, happily, was expecting you both.

574
00:34:23,782 --> 00:34:27,982
What is your scheme? That we now hold hands
and take a house by the sea together?

575
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:31,262
Not quite.
But I have an idea that may be,

576
00:34:31,342 --> 00:34:35,102
as The Times advertisements say,
'to your mutual advantage'.

577
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:42,782
You've got to stop this.
You're poisoning yourself.

578
00:34:42,862 --> 00:34:44,742
Just lay off.

579
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:47,822
Look at you. Sweating like a beast.

580
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:52,302
Just because Her Ladyship let you stay,
you think you can boss us all around.

581
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,502
Forgot the cream.

582
00:34:54,582 --> 00:35:00,222
Oh, Miss Baxter, you may not think
I have the right to ask,

583
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:06,742
but now that Her Ladyship knows
the truth, might you tell me?

584
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:09,342
If you really want me to.

585
00:35:09,422 --> 00:35:13,342
Mr Molesley! Now.
Yes, Mr Carson. Right away.

586
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:15,862
I don't think
I can be hearing this correctly.

587
00:35:15,942 --> 00:35:17,462
No?
No.

588
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:21,542
You seem to suggest I should take the
discarded leavings of Lady Mary Crawley,

589
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:24,462
dust off the fluff
and put them on my own plate.

590
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:27,022
That's not what Charles meant.
Isn't it?

591
00:35:27,102 --> 00:35:30,142
Good. What a relief.
Now we won't have to quarrel.

592
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:33,582
Mabel, you're in love with Tony
Gillingham. You know you are.

593
00:35:33,662 --> 00:35:37,182
All I know is that Tony
broke off our engagement,
which I had not deserved,

594
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:39,622
because Mary
crooked her little finger at him.

595
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:42,222
It was his choice, not mine.
So you say.

596
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:45,022
But now you're bored.
You want someone else to play with.

597
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,222
So, to dry his tears and keep him
occupied, you toss him back to me.

598
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:51,222
This isn't my idea.
Well, it certainly isn't mine.

599
00:35:51,302 --> 00:35:54,142
You know, you're cutting off
your nose to spite your face.

600
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:57,502
I'm going. Well, what shall we do
with your food?

601
00:35:57,582 --> 00:35:59,582
Eat it, and I hope it chokes you.

602
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:05,742
That was a big success
What's your next suggestion?

603
00:36:05,822 --> 00:36:09,222
No, I don't think we need another plan.
This was just a scene we had to play.

604
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,542
Can you put the fricassee there?
We'll share it.

605
00:36:11,622 --> 00:36:14,902
Now, I'd like my beef pink,
but not raw.

606
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:19,204
You didn't linger very long
over your Port.

607
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:22,604
Because we'd both rather be
with the ladies.

608
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,843
Edith, dear. There's something
I'd like to show you in the library.

609
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:28,523
What's that, Granny?
Oh, it's just a particular book

610
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,443
you might find interesting.

611
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,763
How is your fiery friend,
Miss Bunting?

612
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:35,163
I notice we don't see her here
as much as we used to.

613
00:36:35,243 --> 00:36:37,883
Do you wonder at it? Well,
it's good to be disagreed with.

614
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,483
Keeps you on your toes.

615
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:44,003
Then Lord Grantham must have been
on points from the moment
she walked through the door.

616
00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:46,083
I hope you haven't broken with her.

617
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:50,043
She's gone. She left today.

618
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:52,123
Oh, I am sorry.

619
00:36:53,363 --> 00:36:56,163
What about you, Rose? What happened
to the young man you met?

620
00:36:56,243 --> 00:36:59,323
He's gone too.
He's starting a new job in London.

621
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:02,723
Oh, dear. What a sad conversation.

622
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,763
He was interesting.

623
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:09,363
He wasn't just the same old chap
one's supposed to dance with.
His family was unusual.

624
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:12,963
In what way? They came here
from Odessa. 60 years ago.

625
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:15,763
They were driven out by the pogroms,
but they've done well.

626
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:19,363
Well, yes, that is interesting.

627
00:37:19,443 --> 00:37:22,363
I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd think it was a mistake.

628
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:25,683
I suppose it never occurred to you
that I might be right?

629
00:37:25,763 --> 00:37:28,163
What do you expect me to do?
Send her back?

630
00:37:28,243 --> 00:37:31,123
It's too late. We can't get
the child back to Switzerland,

631
00:37:31,203 --> 00:37:33,363
and there's no point
in keeping her here.

632
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,403
What do you mean?
That woman, Mrs...

633
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:39,083
Drewe. Mrs Drewe. Well,
she's at the point of explosion.

634
00:37:39,163 --> 00:37:40,923
We must get the child away.

635
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:43,443
But where would we go?

636
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,523
Not 'we', my dear.

637
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:50,003
There are schools that will take
children from any age.

638
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:53,203
We'll find one in France where
she'll be properly looked after.

639
00:37:53,283 --> 00:37:57,523
I dare say you can even visit,
as long as you never reveal who you are.

640
00:37:57,603 --> 00:38:00,763
It'll be... quite manageable.

641
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:04,603
And you agree with this, Granny?
Well, I know it sounds very harsh.

642
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:08,123
But what else are we to do?

643
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,363
We're going up.

644
00:38:10,443 --> 00:38:13,003
Mama, the car's ready
whenever you want it.

645
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,043
Oh, thank you, Cora.

646
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:17,123
Good night.

647
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:22,203
We'll settle the details later.

648
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:25,123
But I promise you -
this is for the best.

649
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:36,443
Well, in my eyes,
that makes you innocent.

650
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:41,563
It makes you a victim of the crime,
quite as much as Mrs Benton.

651
00:38:41,643 --> 00:38:43,363
Why didn't you tell me this before?

652
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:47,043
Because I knew you'd say it proved my
innocence, when it does no such thing.

653
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,243
I'd rather not hide from the truth,
thank you.

654
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:53,843
Don't hide, then. But don't punish
yourself for ever, either.

655
00:38:53,923 --> 00:38:55,763
No. But I have learned.

656
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:58,083
And I won't ever be controlled again.

657
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:02,483
I must go.

658
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:07,803
Mr Barrow said you wanted me.
Oh, come in and sit down.

659
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:14,123
Mrs Patmore's got something to say.
What's that?

660
00:39:14,203 --> 00:39:17,443
Oh, just how grateful I am
for your excellent advice.

661
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:20,603
Oh, you've taken it, then?
I have. In a way.

662
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:23,163
You've invested in building?

663
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:26,563
Well, she's invested in a building,
yes.

664
00:39:26,643 --> 00:39:29,723
I've found a cottage
in Haughton-le-Skerne,

665
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:32,003
and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

666
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:36,803
It's £300, so it's a big decision,
but you've given me the courage.

667
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:38,843
Oh, that's not what I meant at all.

668
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:42,403
I thought you wanted to be in the
market, to increase your capital.

669
00:39:42,483 --> 00:39:48,363
Well, I'll rent it now and later
I thought I'd take in some lodgers.
It's got three bedrooms.

670
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:50,283
Oh, this is very small beer.

671
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:54,763
Mr Carson, it's my kind of beer,
and I know how to drink it.

672
00:39:54,843 --> 00:39:58,603
But you gave her the idea,
didn't you? She's very grateful.

673
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:03,403
Oh, I am. It's good to hear advice
from a man of the world.

674
00:40:03,483 --> 00:40:06,523
Well, I like to do what I can.

675
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:08,603
We feel thoroughly protected.

676
00:40:27,643 --> 00:40:30,083
Have you forgotten something?

677
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:32,643
It's not your maid.

678
00:40:32,723 --> 00:40:34,963
I waited till she'd gone.

679
00:40:35,043 --> 00:40:36,843
You must leave.

680
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:39,603
Mr Bricker, you must leave.

681
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:42,283
I hope I didn't wake you.
No, not at all, m'lord.

682
00:40:42,363 --> 00:40:46,203
Miss Baxter's only just come down,
so Her Ladyship will still be awake.

683
00:40:46,283 --> 00:40:48,883
Mr Bricker, I've asked you twice
now. Will you please go?

684
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,483
You said yourself -
who knows when I'll be back?

685
00:40:51,563 --> 00:40:53,243
Mr Bricker -
Don't pretend, Cora.

686
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:57,323
You know something's happened between us.
You know things have changed now.

687
00:40:57,403 --> 00:40:59,403
I feel it and I know you do.

688
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:09,323
When did someone last cherish you?

689
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:12,443
When did someone even listen to you?

690
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:15,483
I've seen you with your family,
ignored and passed over.

691
00:41:15,563 --> 00:41:18,443
None of this is any -
I'm glad you're still awake...

692
00:41:25,803 --> 00:41:28,563
The dinner was over early.
It seemed easier to come back.

693
00:41:28,643 --> 00:41:30,683
I'm sorry if it's a disappointment.

694
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:34,163
It isn't.
Mr Bricker was just leaving.

695
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:36,363
I'm not here at Lady Grantham's
invitation.

696
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:39,043
Then will you please leave at mine?

697
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:45,403
Robert, let him go.

698
00:41:45,483 --> 00:41:47,683
You can't be surprised.

699
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,923
When you chose
to ignore a woman like Cora,

700
00:41:50,003 --> 00:41:53,323
you must have known not every man
would be as blind as you.

701
00:41:56,043 --> 00:41:58,763
Stop it!

702
00:41:58,843 --> 00:42:00,843
Stop it! Stop it!

703
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:05,443
Stop!

704
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,563
Mama?

705
00:42:07,643 --> 00:42:11,163
Mama? Papa?
Is everything all right in there?

706
00:42:15,043 --> 00:42:19,043
I'm so sorry, darling. Your father and I
were just playing a stupid game

707
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,763
and we knocked over a lamp.

708
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:24,083
Oh. If you're sure.
I'm sure, poppet.

709
00:42:24,163 --> 00:42:26,163
Good night. Sleep tight.

710
00:42:31,563 --> 00:42:33,723
I think that is my exit too.
Wait.

711
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,083
Golly. What a night.

712
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:52,243
I'll sleep in my dressing room.

713
00:42:56,963 --> 00:43:01,243
Eat a proper breakfast and lunch. There won't
be time for more than a cup of tea later.

714
00:43:01,323 --> 00:43:02,803
I'll try to make it up.

715
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:06,803
When you've finished your duties,
I'd appreciate any help you can give.

716
00:43:06,883 --> 00:43:08,483
We'll clear the hall now.

717
00:43:08,563 --> 00:43:10,683
But why aren't we giving
a proper dinner here?

718
00:43:10,763 --> 00:43:12,643
I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.

719
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:15,403
Mrs Hughes would say
we must move with the times.

720
00:43:15,483 --> 00:43:17,483
Yes. I would.

721
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:22,243
Do you have a bandage I can have?

722
00:43:22,323 --> 00:43:24,723
Have you hurt yourself?
I haven't, no.

723
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:28,123
Mrs Bates, have you heard any more
from that policeman?

724
00:43:28,203 --> 00:43:30,923
No.

725
00:43:31,003 --> 00:43:33,123
Here we go. That's Lady Mary.

726
00:43:33,203 --> 00:43:35,083
Do you think you will?

727
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:37,643
No. I hope not, anyway.

728
00:43:40,043 --> 00:43:41,963
Why do you pester her with this?

729
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:44,043
Because I feel like it.

730
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:47,563
Mr Barrow. Upstairs, please.

731
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:49,643
You too, Mr Molesley.

732
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:15,563
The car is waiting, sir.
Your case is inside it.

733
00:44:15,643 --> 00:44:17,643
Thank you, Carson.

734
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,043
Thank you.

735
00:44:52,683 --> 00:44:55,963
The Lady Beaumont.
The Lord Howard of Glossop.

736
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:58,483
Lovely to see you.
Good evening.

737
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,283
Howard.
Lord Grantham.

738
00:45:01,363 --> 00:45:03,363
I'd forgotten his father had died.

739
00:45:09,243 --> 00:45:11,243
Thank you, Barrow.

740
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:13,603
Oh, thank you.

741
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:16,923
My dear,
we can't leave things as they are.

742
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:20,083
It's a tinderbox.
It could go up at any moment.

743
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:21,923
Granny, if I was to take her
to London -

744
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:24,883
Oh, don't be ridiculous, my darling.
Think.

745
00:45:24,963 --> 00:45:27,163
All I'm saying is,
there must be another way.

746
00:45:27,243 --> 00:45:28,563
Well, how can there be?

747
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:32,363
Mrs Reginald Crawley
and the Lord Merton.

748
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:36,963
Hello, Isobel.
It's cousin Isobel.

749
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:39,043
And her follower.

750
00:45:40,483 --> 00:45:42,763
The Earl and Countess of Woolton.

751
00:45:42,843 --> 00:45:46,043
I'm fine. May I sit down?
Are you tired?

752
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:49,643
No, but I rather foolishly twisted
my ankle getting out of the car.

753
00:45:49,723 --> 00:45:54,083
Oh, dear. Be careful - Lord Merton
will have you on the operating table

754
00:45:54,163 --> 00:45:56,603
before you can say 'knife'.

755
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,483
What about Lady Ingleby's pearls?

756
00:45:58,563 --> 00:46:01,883
I was so jealous, I wanted
to snatch them off her throat!

757
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:06,763
Sir Henry and Lady Lawson.

758
00:46:08,843 --> 00:46:11,483
Well, that's that.

759
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,643
And you're back at your books,
I see.

760
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:15,643
I'm not giving up -
don't think I will.

761
00:46:15,723 --> 00:46:17,523
And I wouldn't want you to.

762
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:19,883
Right, I'm going up.
Don't forget the light.

763
00:46:19,963 --> 00:46:23,203
Oh, gracious! Good evening, m'lady.

764
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:27,003
I didn't expect to see you down here.
Mr Carson said you'd all gone to bed.

765
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:30,003
I wanted to make a telephone call
without...

766
00:46:30,083 --> 00:46:32,203
I wanted to make a private call.

767
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:34,363
And you thought
you'd use Mr Carson's phone?

768
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:37,163
I don't think he'd mind. Do you?
I'm sure he wouldn't.

769
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:39,483
Well, I'll leave you to it.
Good night, m'lady.

770
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,563
Good night.

771
00:46:54,963 --> 00:46:57,163
I'd like to make a trunk call
to London.

772
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:04,003
The York & Ainsty are holding
a point-to-point at Canningford Grange.

773
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,083
Can you see Aunt Mary?

774
00:47:07,163 --> 00:47:10,523
You were always asking if I need help.
Well, now's your chance. Help me.

775
00:47:10,603 --> 00:47:13,603
If I talk to anyone, it'll be you.
Then talk to me. Please.

776
00:47:13,683 --> 00:47:15,963
You're losing your sense
of the appropriate.

777
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:18,083
You're losing your sense of occasion.

778
00:47:18,163 --> 00:47:19,576
You think I'm a murderer.

779
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:22,500

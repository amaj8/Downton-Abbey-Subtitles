1
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,240
Take them straight
to the wagonette.

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,590
The inventory, Mr Carson.

3
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,800
Oh. Thank you.

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,760
~ Mrs Hughes.
~ Oh. Thank you, Mr Barrow.

5
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,950
How can we get it up to London?

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,870
Don't worry. We'll have plenty
of time to make repairs.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,630
I must say, you're a real artist.

8
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,030
Well, it's as much
Daisy's work as mine.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,310
Now, how much should we take and
what can we buy when we get there?

10
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,990
I'm happy to tell you that
most things you can buy in Ripon

11
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,350
are also available in London.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,270
But you don't trust them
quite the same.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,040
Well, YOU don't.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,550
Why is she coming to London?
Haven't they replaced Mrs Bute?

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,430
Oh no, no, they're not going to.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,670
There'll be no permanent housekeeper
at Grantham House in future.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,950
Another clang in the march of time.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,350
~ Ta dah!
~ Oh, that's lovely.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,150
~ You don't think it's a bit mumsy?
~ No!

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,080
~ It's very chic.
~ Can we see it with the hat?

21
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,110
~ Are you looking forward to London?
~ I am.

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,030
Mr Bates and I need to inspect
our house, so the timing
couldn't be better.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,430
~ I'm sorry Susan's missing all this.
~ She doesn't care about clothes.

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,790
I still don't understand why they
didn't come two months ago.

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,630
The Government changed the date
for the hand-over. They were stuck.

26
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,110
I'd have come back if it were
my daughter's wedding.

27
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,550
I do not suggest a career
in the Diplomatic.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,790
~ Will they be there before us?
~ No.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,150
They're spending the night
in Southampton.

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,470
We'll all arrive in St James's
on the same day.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,710
Are we to pretend
they're a happy couple?

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,550
~ Yes, we jolly well are.
~ Why cast a shadow?

33
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,110
~ I quite agree.
~ I'm sorry it can't be here.

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,350
I don't think a registry office
wedding and a church blessing

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,950
would be what the county expects,

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,430
and London makes more sense
for Susan and Shrimpie.

37
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,470
And I want a blessing in a synagogue.
Would you find a synagogue in Ripon?

38
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,430
I do admire the way you just
take it all in your stride.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,830
It would make it easier
for Lord Sinderby.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,030
Oh, I'm not sure Lord Sinderby
deserves your concern.

41
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,950
Atticus loves him and I love Atticus.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,190
Love may not conquer all,
but it can conquer quite a lot.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,110
I worried about her ladyship
having to face the traitor,

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,350
but Miss O'Brien's got herself
taken on by the new Governor's wife.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,550
Typical, but I've been told
they've neither maid nor valet,

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,550
which seems odd for
a Marquess and Marchioness.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,830
I don't think they have two pennies
to rub together. It's all gone.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,790
So, the Sinderby millions
must be a cheering thought.

49
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,190
I wonder. Lady Flintshire's not
the most liberal being on the planet.

50
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,630
~ No.
~ Then again...

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,990
~ Madge says Lord Sinderby's
none too keen. ~ So I gather.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,550
Hurrah for intolerance on both sides.

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,790
I'm worried about running it with
only Messrs Barrow and Molesley.

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,830
~ You think we'll look a bit dingy?
~ Don't you?

55
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,310
~ Could we borrow a spare footman?
~ I don't know.

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,310
Borrowing footmen sounds like
something out of the last century.

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,950
Even to me!

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,550
Hire a lad for the week.
It wouldn't cost much.

59
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,750
~ That's to be it for the Big Parade?
~ The Big Parade's passed, Mr Carson.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,360
We're just trying to keep up
as best we can.

61
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,950
My turn.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,270
What would my father say?

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:10,230
That you were building a very solid
friendship with your granddaughter.

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,430
No, darling. You've landed on a snake
so you have to go back to there.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,790
No!

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,070
Don't be so mean.
Let her stay where she is.

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,830
It won't be very helpful later on
if we don't teach her how to lose.

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,590
Go ahead and cry, darling.

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,630
~ Make Donk feel guilty.
~ Don't call me Donk!

70
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,270
Oh hurry up, Donk!
It's your turn.

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,750
~ What's that?
~ It's from my cousin in Boston.

72
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,430
He sells cars but he wants
to expand into farm machinery.

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,590
Well, you know about both.

74
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,830
Exactly. He'd like me
to come in with him.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,190
Oh, is he opening a branch over here?

76
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,750
No. He's asked me to join him
in Massachusetts.

77
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,950
~ As a partner.
~ Oh, I see.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,790
~ How's Lord Sinderby? ~ I think
he dreams of my changing my mind.

79
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,550
You'd think with a father like that

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,790
Atticus would have
a more Jewish name.

81
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,270
His real name is Ephraim Atticus,

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,110
but his mother called him Atticus
as a baby and it stuck.

83
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,470
She's your ally.

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,750
Yes, but not because she thinks
it's all unimportant,

85
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,870
just that she thinks her son's
happiness is more important.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,150
Thank you!

87
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,270
I like the sound of that.

88
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,270
Mr and Mrs Bates. Might I take up
a moment of your time?

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,150
I had a call earlier
from Sergeant Willis.

90
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,190
Mr Vyner is back up here and
wants to come by in the morning.

91
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
~ To see me.
~ To see both of you.

92
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,550
I don't understand. Why?

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,070
I dare say it will become clearer
after he's been.

94
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,150
We hoped this was over.

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,080
So did I, Mr Bates. So did I.

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,230
I'm going up.

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,750
Good night.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,080
I'll check on the children
so you don't have to.

99
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,270
She's keen. I'll give her that.

100
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,110
Why does she have to carry on
as if she'd invented motherhood?

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,390
I'm going to bed, too.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,230
Before you do, have you thought
about the work in the village?

103
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,750
Those cottages are in quite a state
and we ought to get on with it.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,030
I know, I know, but how are we
going to find the money?

105
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,400
Let's think about it while we're
in London and make a decision.

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,990
Is it true that London Inspector
is coming back tomorrow?

107
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,400
How do you know that?

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,310
Just remember I'd be happy to swear
I saw that ticket in one piece.

109
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,600
~ Her ladyship's on her way to bed.
~ Right. Thank you.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
I hope Miss Baxter's not all
we've got between us and trouble.

111
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,190
I want to use London this time
because I always resolve

112
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,270
to visit theatres and
galleries and museums.

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,950
Then I get home
and I've not done anything.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,230
I'll join you.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,230
~ We'll go together.
~ I'll hold you to that.

116
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,510
~ Ah. The date of the unveiling.
~ Of the memorial? When is it?

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,750
On the 25th, so we'll just
be back from the wedding.

118
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,750
Everyone, we will be unveiling
the war memorial in the village

119
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,510
at twelve noon on the 25th.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,590
I'd like the house
to be well represented.

121
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,390
I hope you won't object
if I don't come, Mr Carson.

122
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,710
Oh? You'd be missed.

123
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,990
I don't want to drag it up again,
but it would be painful.

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,470
Mr Carson understands.

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
Yes, that's as may be.

126
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,310
Poor woman.

127
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,600
You heard her.
Let's not drag it up again.

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,430
~ Have you quite finished, m'lady?
~ Yes, thank you, Denker.

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,910
Who was that at the door?

130
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,430
A gentleman called
Prince Kuragin, m'lady.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
He's in the drawing room.

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,310
I told him you weren't downstairs
but he said he'd wait.

133
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,630
~ He was most insistent.
~ Yes I...

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,430
I don't think I'll wear
what I chose last night.

135
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,030
I suspected that might be the case
so I put out the lavender day dress.

136
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,310
Goes very well with
your ladyship's colouring.

137
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,030
The Prince is an old friend, Denker,
nothing more.

138
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,110
Oh, I'm sure, m'lady, but it never
hurts to look your best, does it?

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,280
No. I don't believe it does.

140
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,830
We'll need representatives of
the regiments involved and a band,

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,150
but I dare say
that's all under control.

142
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
I dare say it is, m'lord.

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,950
Oh, I'd like William Mason's father
to have a good place.

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,390
William left this house
to give his life for his country.

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,710
~ I feel that very deeply.
~ We all do, m'lord.

146
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,270
~ Will you tell the staff?
~ Already done.

147
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,030
We should have a good turnout.

148
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,830
Mrs Patmore has asked to be excused
but that's understandable.

149
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,910
I'm sorry, but not surprised.

150
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,360
M'lord.

151
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,590
I don't know what you mean by
"our last chance".

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,950
We left any chance we had behind us,
many years ago.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,910
~ I don't accept that.
~ And what about the Princess?

154
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,350
They haven't found her yet.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,390
We've been apart
for a long time.

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,350
Are you proposing to divorce?

157
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,280
Why? Do you want more children?

158
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,520
I wish to spend
my final years with you.

159
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,070
As a friend, as a lover.

160
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,280
I don't seek scandal, only love.

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,390
The last years have been ugly.

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,510
I don't want what remains
to be ugly.

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,350
No.

164
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,280
So...

165
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,670
.. what do you say?

166
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,630
~ You want an answer just like that?
~ I know my own feelings. You do too.

167
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,600
I can't make a decision now!

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,390
I won't change.

169
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,880
Don't proclaim your intransigence
as if it were a virtue.

170
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,990
Things have advanced a little.

171
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,790
It seems Mr Green was not quite the
sunny soul that Mr Carson depicted.

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,830
He appears to have carried out
a series of attacks on women.

173
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,630
They were too nervous
to come forward before now,

174
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,870
but with a little encouragement
some of them have spoken out.

175
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,870
We've formed a picture
of his behaviour.

176
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,950
But nothing happened here!

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,230
His victims were generally
small, slight women,

178
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,110
who'd given little or no
encouragement.

179
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,150
~ How very unpleasant.
~ It is rather 'unpleasant'.

180
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,750
~ Wouldn't you agree, Mrs Bates?
~ Yes.

181
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,550
We also have news which may put
Mr Bates in the clear.

182
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,350
A second witness has come forward.

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,030
His evidence suggests whoever was
arguing with Green on the pavement

184
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,430
was shorter than him.

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,430
Shorter than yourself, Mr Bates.

186
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,600
~ What do you think, Mrs Hughes?
~ I don't know a thing about it.

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
We'll leave it there.

188
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,590
If we need Mrs Bates to come
to London, could that be arranged?

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,390
We'll be in London next week
for Lady Rose's wedding.

190
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,030
Could you pop in to Scotland Yard
on Tuesday at ten o'clock?

191
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,040
~ If she comes, I'll be with her.
~ As you wish. Now I'll say goodbye.

192
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,830
What on earth was that about?

193
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,070
He's trying to bully it out,

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,480
but it's best not to
stand in his way.

195
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,280
Bully what out?

196
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,550
You're required upstairs, Mr Carson.

197
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,750
~ Mr Evans. It's good of you to come.
~ I'm pleased to, m'lord.

198
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,870
Your father carved many stones
for our dogs over the years.

199
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,910
So I'm glad you're prepared
to go on with it.

200
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,630
These are like the ones
we've made for you in the past.

201
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,310
Is this a book of pets' tombstones?
A parallel universe.

202
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,550
No, m'lord.
You've examples of everything we do.

203
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,110
Oh, I see. What's this?

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,870
A memorial, m'lord.

205
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,560
~ We made it for a garden in Hinckley.
~ Near Leicester? You do get about.

206
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,270
There you are! You took your time.

207
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,670
I thought you'd rung by accident.

208
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,990
How would you like to be summoned,
by Joshua's trumpet?

209
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,830
I prefer not to be
"summoned" at all.

210
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,270
At any rate, not by you.

211
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,750
Take these down to the car.

212
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm going to fetch her
galoshes and umbrella.

213
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,510
I've been thinking.

214
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,950
Should I tell them everything when
we get there and have done with it?

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,590
No. I'm not one to give up
my secrets unless I have to.

216
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,790
They have nothing if the man
who killed him can't have been you.

217
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,270
Even so.

218
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,830
Daisy?

219
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,230
Yes, Mr Carson.

220
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,350
Before we go, his lordship wants
to extend an invitation to Mr Mason

221
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,710
for the unveiling, which will
include you as William's widow.

222
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,110
~ Thank you, Mr Carson.
~ I'll write to him as Chairman.

223
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,830
It might be nice if you were to
mention it in your next letter.

224
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,630
~ Of course.
~ Right.

225
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,040
Well, we'd better
get up to the cars.

226
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,910
I hope you can manage a few days
without Denker, Spratt.

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,030
A hope that will be fulfilled
and gladly, m'lady.

228
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,590
Are these all the cases, Denker?

229
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,390
Your ladyship is very sharp-eyed.

230
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,960
We are missing one.

231
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,790
Since Mr Spratt was given the task
of bringing them down,

232
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,270
no doubt he's put it somewhere
for safe keeping.

233
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,750
Oh, how very considerate of you,
Spratt.

234
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,990
~ Fetch it now, please.
~ But your ladyship, I don't...

235
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,360
Fetch the case, Spratt.

236
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,030
I feel so guilty,
leaving Marigold on her own.

237
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,270
Oh, she's surrounded
by nannies and children!

238
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,520
~ I know.
~ She'll have a whale of a time.

239
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,790
Edith is obsessed with that child.

240
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,430
~ She's a dear little thing.
~ So she is.

241
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,630
But as a matter of fact,
there is something about her.

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,310
~ About Marigold? What?
~ I don't know. A sense of deja vu.

243
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,680
I can't quite put my finger on it.

244
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,230
All of you, Andy will be an extra
footman while we're in London.

245
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,390
Please be helpful to him.

246
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,510
~ Starting at dinner tonight?
~ That's the idea.

247
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,070
~ How did Mr Carson find you?
~ I was working as a hall boy.

248
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,070
Mr Carson rang my old butler.

249
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,310
It's only a week's work.
Will he take you back?

250
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,030
I don't want to go back
as a hall boy.

251
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,710
I want to be a footman now
and this is the first step.

252
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,790
~ I think that's brave.
~ You've got to be brave these days.

253
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,350
~ Do you know London well?
~ Not here. I grew up in the East End.

254
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,830
~ I've only ever worked in Bayswater.
~ Bayswater?

255
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,750
~ North of the park.
~ Oh yes, I know where it is.

256
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,710
~ So you're not known round here then?
~ No.

257
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,750
You're just with us
'til after the wedding?

258
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,710
~ That's it.
~ I dare say you enjoy a bit of fun.

259
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,590
I s'pose so.
As much as the next man.

260
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,470
There's fun to be had round here
if you know where to look for it.

261
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,030
~ You know this area, then?
~ Oh, yes. I've come home.

262
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,430
I spent many a year
in St James's Square.

263
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,550
Before we get drawn into
Miss Denker's past adventures,

264
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,630
why don't you come with me and
I'll show you how it all works?

265
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,960
Chop, chop.

266
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,750
Welcome the hunter,
home from the hill.

267
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,030
~ How are you both?
~ Worn out!

268
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,350
The train from Southampton

269
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,390
was almost as bad as
the voyage from Bombay.

270
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,400
You must lie down before you change.

271
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,430
Do you remember Carson?

272
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,750
I gather you haven't brought
any personal attendants, m'lord.

273
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,280
~ Those days are done for us.
~ We needn't tell the world.

274
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,070
You will have Lady Mary's maid Anna,
to help you, m'lady.

275
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,910
His lordship will have Mr Molesley.
Now I'll show you to your room.

276
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,630
We're not in one room? Together?

277
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,630
~ The thing is, we're very squashed.
~ I'm not sharing a room.

278
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,990
~ I'll go to an hotel.
~ Come on...

279
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,800
Don't worry m'lady, we'll manage.
If you'd like to come this way.

280
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,350
Maybe Lady Rose
could share with Lady Edith?

281
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,320
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

282
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,760
I knew she'd be trouble.

283
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,670
Mummy.

284
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,110
~ They said you'd arrived.
~ Yes. What a journey.

285
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,910
I seem to have been travelling
for as long as I can remember.

286
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,550
Well, you're here now.

287
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,070
Won't you give your
poor old mother a kiss?

288
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,480
Of course.

289
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,910
~ This is quite a choice you've made.
~ I hope you'll like him.

290
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,990
They're all coming
for dinner tonight.

291
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,230
And you're quite, quite sure?

292
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,230
Absolutely.

293
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,440
Well then,
that's all I needed to hear.

294
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,870
~ Has Mr Carson announced dinner?
~ They're not all here yet.

295
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,510
I found a letter from Mr Vyner
when we arrived,

296
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,230
confirming I'm to be at
Scotland Yard in the morning.

297
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,830
Try not to worry about it.

298
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,040
Why not go to see your house
afterwards? You'd enjoy that.

299
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,110
Now, in London, we supervise,

300
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,230
but they help themselves to coffee
and drinks from a side table.

301
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,990
Once they settle,
we leave them to it.

302
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,670
In my last place, the footmen
stayed 'til they went to bed.

303
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,800
If they want a second drink,
it's up to them.

304
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,230
There we are.

305
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,870
I hope Anna was helpful.

306
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,990
She will be, I'm sure.

307
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,710
Where are the Sinderbys?

308
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh?! We thought you might be
Lord and Lady Sinderby.

309
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,830
'Fraid not.

310
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,870
Hello.

311
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,310
~ What are they like?
~ She's very nice and fond of Rose.

312
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,910
~ He's less convinced.
~ Rose is more than a match for him.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,630
It does make me smile that they
should be the ones objecting.

314
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,110
~ They have as much right as we do.
~ Mummy, Daddy...

315
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,310
Can you try to behave
like a happy couple?

316
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,350
~ Wouldn't that be rather dishonest?
~ You haven't separated yet.

317
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,470
We separated the moment we walked
down the gangway at Southampton.

318
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,710
It won't kill us to put on a show
for a few more days.

319
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,190
The thing is, I don't want to give
Lord Sinderby any ammunition.

320
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,230
So, Lady Rose MacClare
is a mesalliance.

321
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,350
I'm not sure that's helpful, Granny.

322
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,190
Lord and Lady Sinderby
and Mr Atticus Aldridge.

323
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,510
Do come in. How lovely to see you.

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,070
Daddy, Mummy. This is Atticus.

325
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,080
~ How do you do?
~ What a peculiar name.

326
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,310
How's it going?

327
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,230
~ Lady Flintshire is not a push-over.
~ I told you that.

328
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,310
I must ask, because I can't
get it out of my mind,

329
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,910
why has the Inspector
summoned Mrs Bates?

330
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,590
Would it help if I swore neither
of them has done anything wrong?

331
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,790
I never doubted it,
but it's a relief to hear.

332
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,710
I'd better go up.

333
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,830
What made you choose Yorkshire?
Was it a historic reason?

334
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,830
Not really. I used to go there as
a girl and of course it's beautiful.

335
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,990
Do you have any English blood?

336
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,870
We only date from the 1850s,

337
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,390
but Lady Sinderby's family arrived
in the reign of King Richard III.

338
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,350
Really? I think of you as nomads,
drifting around the world.

339
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,150
Talking of drifting round, is it true
you're starting your honeymoon

340
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,150
at the Melfords' in Coningsby?

341
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,230
Oh yes.
Lady Melford is Mother's cousin.

342
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,550
Is she? I never knew that.

343
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,430
~ You wanted a synagogue blessing?
~ I'd like to respect both sides.

344
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,710
You don't understand our customs.
Then again, why should you?

345
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,350
~ So it won't be possible?
~ No. He should have told you.

346
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,390
I thought we could have
a dinner on Wednesday night

347
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,230
so you could meet
some of the relations.

348
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,750
And show them how lucky they are!

349
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,790
~ Have you got many staying?
~ We're crammed to the gunwales.

350
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,990
Atticus has had to move
into the Halnaby Hotel.

351
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,310
I love the Halnaby.

352
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,310
It makes sense and he can have
his... What do they call it now?

353
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,670
His stag party there,
without disturbing us.

354
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,270
~ Will you be going, Lord Sinderby?
~ Hardly.

355
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,910
Stag parties are high on
Father's disapproval list.

356
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,510
Is it a long list, Lord Sinderby,
the things you disapprove of?

357
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,990
No, as long as I can steer clear
of card sharps and undercooked fish,

358
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,590
and divorce,
I think I'm fairly easy.

359
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,190
Is divorce so terrible? Is it worse
to stay together and be miserable?

360
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,070
I am clearly old-fashioned but to me
divorce signifies weakness.

361
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,190
Degradation, scandal and failure.

362
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,110
~ Are you glad to be in London again?
~ I will be when I get the house back.

363
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,470
~ When do the tenants go?
~ Next week in theory.

364
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,990
~ I need to pull the real pictures
out of storage. ~ What a palaver!

365
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,070
I know, but think of the relief

366
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,950
when I can shut the door at last
and be alone in my own home.

367
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,270
~ Won't Lord Flintshire be with you?
~ Of course he will.

368
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,230
Of course I will.
What a funny thing to say, Susan.

369
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,070
Funny is one word for it.

370
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,870
Well, I want you to know that you'll
always be welcome at Canningford.

371
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,190
How kind.

372
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
Tell me, do you find it difficult
these days to get staff?

373
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,510
Not very.

374
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,120
But then we're Jewish,
so we pay well.

375
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,360
If I don't get an early night,
I'll never make it through the week.

376
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,190
Is Dicky Merton coming
to the wedding?

377
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,110
I don't think so.

378
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,430
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

379
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,950
You've changed your tune.

380
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,350
I've been reminded recently that one
is not given many chances in life

381
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,350
and if you miss them,

382
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,600
they may not necessarily be repeated.

383
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,390
~ Sinderby's as stiff as a board.
~ What more can I do?

384
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,350
May I ask, do you two worry about
Sybbie and George when you're away?

385
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,910
Why should we?

386
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,270
No reason, but I think about
Marigold all the time.

387
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,790
What are you going to be like
when you have your own?

388
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,110
~ I intend to leave it all to Nanny.
~ You say that.

389
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,110
I'm used to the way the children
live at Downton, but it seems odd.

390
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,510
~ Will it be different in America?
~ He isn't going and that's flat.

391
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,870
~ Mary...
~ Stop!

392
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,590
This is my wedding
and I'm not having it spoiled.

393
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,470
Quite right. I tell you what.

394
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,510
Why don't the four of us go for
lunch on Wednesday? Even you, Edith.

395
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,910
To mark Rose's last days of freedom
and the end of an era.

396
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,310
Let's go to Rules. My treat.

397
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,910
~ Yes.
~ Why not?

398
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,950
Sinderby's going to be
quite a challenge for Rose.

399
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,230
No doubt about that.

400
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,230
And what possessed Susan?
"Do you have any English blood?"

401
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,790
~ Really!
~ She speaks without thinking.

402
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,750
By the way, Did you know Bates and Anna
are going to Scotland Yard tomorrow morning?

403
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,350
~ Certainly not! Why?
~ Bates didn't really give a reason.

404
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,040
~ Do they want character testimonials?
~ I offered, but he said no. Not yet.

405
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,790
The stone mason has sent his bill.
Is Mrs Patmore downstairs?

406
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,110
I believe so, m'lord.

407
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,230
~ And is Bates back?
~ Not yet, m'lord.

408
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
A strange business, Carson.

409
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,470
~ Can I help?
~ I'm trying to find the letter
box.. or don't you have one?

410
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,750
It's through there,
but the post may have gone.

411
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,870
~ Is it crucial?
~ A bit crucial.

412
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,070
I hate saying, "the cheque's
in the post" when it isn't.

413
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,870
I'll walk up to Jermyn Street.

414
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,830
Here's Carson. Is Lady Flintshire
too late to give you a letter?

415
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,990
No, m'lord. I'm collecting them now.

416
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,550
Thank you, Carson.

417
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,390
Miss Baxter and Mr Molesley
have asked me

418
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,990
to see the Wallace Collection
with them tomorrow.

419
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,110
~ Daisy, the wedding is on Friday!
~ That's what I said.

420
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,030
But, it's only Tuesday now
and we've done most of it

421
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,470
apart from the stuff
we can't do before the day.

422
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,110
I don't know. Is this a kitchen
or a holiday resort?

423
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,830
Oh, go but...

424
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,560
If you're not back by teatime,
I'll call the police.

425
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,790
Oh, my God!

426
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,670
I do apologise for interrupting
your work, Mrs Patmore.

427
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,670
That's quite all right, m'lord.
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a mess.

428
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,550
Not at all, please.

429
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,510
I just wanted to ask you
if you might reconsider

430
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,590
coming to the unveiling
of the memorial.

431
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,510
~ I don't mean to be rude, m'lord...
~ I know that.

432
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,750
But, it's important reconciliation
is the spirit of the day.

433
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,550
I should feel I had failed if you
were to be absent from the ceremony.

434
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,510
Please. I ask it as a favour.

435
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,110
Very well. If it means that much
to your lordship.

436
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,480
It does. Thank you.

437
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,350
~ If you'll come this way, Mrs Bates.
~ I'm staying with her.

438
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,520
Suit yourself.
Through here please.

439
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,950
Take your place in the line.

440
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,350
~ But why? What have I done?
~ This is madness.

441
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
Come along.

442
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,320
Hold the cards in front of you.

443
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,640
Thank you very much.
You may go.

444
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,310
What is this about?

445
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,910
She had nothing to do with it.
You know that!

446
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,430
Calm yourself. You must be aware that
most of this stuff is just routine?

447
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,510
So we can cross people off our lists.

448
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,910
Let's go. We have some business
to attend to, while we're here.

449
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,160
You'll want to get on with it, then.

450
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,350
Have you got the hang of it now?

451
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,230
I think so. Dinner's done and dusted
without incident.

452
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,910
I'll take you for a walk later,
show you the sights.

453
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,270
~ What about Lady Grantham?
~ She'll be in bed before then.

454
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,070
Would you mind taking the coffee up
while it's still hot?

455
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,800
Or is that too much to ask?

456
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,110
I hope you're not planning to
lead him into bad ways, Miss Denker.

457
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,350
No. Andy isn't a country lad, is he?

458
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,390
I expect he knows his way around
better than I do.

459
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,910
I doubt that.

460
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,190
She's got a plan in mind, that one,

461
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,640
a plan to her own advantage
and I'd like to know...

462
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,590
~ Daisy? Are you listening?
~ London's full of possibilities.

463
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,230
Life's full of possibilities.

464
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,830
Really? Sometimes I think my life
has no possibilities at all.

465
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,590
Where's Aunt Violet?

466
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,150
MY Aunt Violet has gone up.
So has Mrs Crawley.

467
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,470
And Atticus?
Where is the lovelorn swain tonight?

468
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,280
Don't you remember?
He's got his bachelor party.

469
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,710
Do you like him, Daddy?
Please say you do.

470
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,270
Certainly I do. Very much.

471
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,990
Did you get to Bond Street?

472
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,990
The chap I need to see was busy.
I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

473
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,670
Please don't make us late for
Lady Sinderby's dinner.

474
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,390
~ What are you doing in Bond Street?
~ It's an idea I've had, that's all.

475
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,640
An idea he is clearly
not going to share with us.

476
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,230
That's it. I'm going to bed.

477
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,470
You said we'd have one more drink
and I've had one more.

478
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,440
So now I'm off to bed.

479
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,390
You can stay as long as you want.
Put it on my bill.

480
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,110
Champagne!

481
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,990
No, not tonight.

482
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,240
I'm sorry if I misled you,
but it's not going to happen.

483
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,440
~ Who is it?
~ Your tea, sir.

484
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,080
But I didn't order any tea.

485
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,120
What on earth?

486
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,510
Is this a joke?
Did Mr Ryecart pay you to come up?

487
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:31,150
Just wait, one moment...

488
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,800
Bye.

489
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,470
Andy? How was last night?

490
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,590
Did you go for your walk
with Miss Denker?

491
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Yes, I bloody well did,
the more fool me.

492
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,520
~ Is everything all right, Mr Barrow?
~ Just fine, Mrs Hughes, thank you.

493
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,510
Michael and I had luncheon here
on our very first date.

494
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,510
One day you'll be glad to think
of the times you spent together.

495
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,120
You're the only member of the family
that seems to understand.

496
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,910
Sorry we're late.

497
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,550
~ How did you get on?
~ So well!

498
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,830
If I show you, the women here
will be too jealous to eat.

499
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,030
Oh. Er, this came for you
by messenger.

500
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,840
~ Carson asked me give it to you.
~ Thank you.

501
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,550
Who's it from?

502
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,200
It's not signed. There's just a note
that says "Last night".

503
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,510
~ What is it?
~ Atticus.

504
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,190
Picking up a tart of some kind
and letting her into his room.

505
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
What?!

506
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,270
~ Oh, God.
~ Have some water.

507
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,320
~ Are you ready to order?
~ May we have a few more moments?

508
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,350
~ What are you going to do?
~ I'm not sure.

509
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,190
Maybe I'll chuck tonight, but what
should I do about the wedding?

510
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,670
I'll tell you what you'll do.

511
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,990
Go and telephone Atticus now.
Arrange to see him this afternoon.

512
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,640
Mary, go with her.

513
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,990
This is classic
stag party stuff.

514
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,190
You mean they got him drunk,
set him up,

515
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,990
and booked a photographer to
maximise his embarrassment?

516
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,950
I'm sure he's regretting it
bitterly this morning.

517
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,070
But is "regretting it" enough?
It wouldn't be for me.

518
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:33,710
There is a man who'd rather
this marriage didn't take place

519
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,190
and his name's Lord Sinderby.

520
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,710
Would he do something so grubby?

521
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,000
You'd be surprised what people
can sink to, to get their own way.

522
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,800
They're talking now. He'll meet her
in St James's Park at three.

523
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,510
This is to confirm there'll be
no upstairs dinner tonight.

524
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,760
The family is dining
with Lady Sinderby.

525
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,190
I can't see why we bothered
to get an extra footman.

526
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,910
We should've just hired some help
for the wedding and left it at that.

527
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,310
It's unusual for
a bridegroom's parents

528
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,630
to entertain just before a marriage.

529
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:15,630
~ It feels quite foreign.
~ Maybe that sort do it differently.

530
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,550
~ Oh, don't you start!
~ I am not prejudiced, Mrs Hughes.

531
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,430
There are many things you could
accuse me of, but not that.

532
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,080
How about lack of self knowledge?

533
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,950
Mr Carson, could Andy
have some time off tonight?

534
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,550
If the family don't need him?

535
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,870
He's only been here a couple of days
and he's asking for extra time off?

536
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,030
He wants me to show him
a bit of the town.

537
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,230
And the Dowager?

538
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,830
I'll be back in time
to put her to bed.

539
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,630
I want everyone here
until the family leaves,

540
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,910
and make sure you're back
by ten o'clock.

541
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,350
What were you going to show him that
you didn't show him last night?

542
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,950
Why? What did he tell you?

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,270
~ Only that he didn't enjoy himself.
~ Oh poor Diddums.

544
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,920
I hope he's made of
sterner stuff than that.

545
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,750
~ I never even knew it existed.
~ Oh, I like these smaller museums.

546
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,710
The Wallace Collection or
the Mauritshuis near the Hague.

547
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,950
~ Have you been to Holland?
~ No, I've just read about it.

548
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,070
It's as if the intimacy,
being near the paintings,

549
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,710
makes them more powerful.

550
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,590
I feel the same. Do you, Daisy?

551
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,270
I feel as if I've been
down a coal hole

552
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,550
and someone's opened the lid
and brought me into the sunlight.

553
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,150
~ Well, that's very gratifying.
~ Is it, though?

554
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,190
I feel so resentful, so discontented.

555
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,870
It's as if my old life were a prison
I have to go back to.

556
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,230
Don't say that! I don't want
to think I've made things worse.

557
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
Isn't that Lady Rose?

558
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,150
This doesn't even
make any sense! Stop!

559
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,350
Let's leave them to it.

560
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,000
I don't know. You're never safe
'til the ring's on your finger.

561
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,630
Do you want to be safe, Miss Baxter?

562
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,720
I might.

563
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,670
You really believe
I would stoop so low?

564
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,150
~ You think that of me?
~ I am satisfied it was not a prank.

565
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,550
Rather a plan to induce Lady Rose
to withdraw from the marriage?

566
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,710
~ Call her Rose, for heaven's sake.
~ And you think I am the perpetrator?

567
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,590
You are opposed to my marrying her,

568
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,270
much more so than I have confessed
to Rose or her family.

569
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,230
Very well. Let us be honest.

570
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,830
I am against it.

571
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,350
Our family has achieved a great deal
since we came to this country

572
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,190
and not just for ourselves,
for our people.

573
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,110
We have a proud history

574
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,070
and we've taken our place among
the leaders in this land.

575
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,070
And now, you want to throw all
that away for this little shiksa.

576
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,630
~ Don't call her that!
~ I'm sorry.

577
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,910
I don't mean to insult the girl.
She seems decent enough.

578
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,590
But she is English and Anglican
and so will her children be...

579
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,190
~ She's Scottish.
~ British, then.

580
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,470
The second Lord Sinderby may be
Jewish, but the third will not.

581
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,510
Soon our family will be
one more British dynasty

582
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,750
with all the same prejudices as
everyone else who shops at Harrods!

583
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,830
Any children will be brought up to
know both sides of their heritage.

584
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,190
Your children will not be Jewish!
Don't you understand that?

585
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,990
Their mother will not be Jewish
and neither will they!

586
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,910
They may choose to convert.

587
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,310
Or are you implacably opposed
to giving anyone a free choice?

588
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,870
How easy you make it sound,

589
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,950
and how little you've had to fight.

590
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,710
You must come.

591
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,160
They're here.

592
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,350
I need your word it wasn't you.

593
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,390
Of course it wasn't me!

594
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,520
Don't you know me at all?

595
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,830
Atticus says it must have been
a practical joke.

596
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,230
~ Do you believe him?
~ I don't think it was a joke.

597
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,270
It was either true and he's lying,

598
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,910
or someone is trying
to stop the wedding.

599
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,550
~ I'd like to know which.
~ Preferably before Friday.

600
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,590
Rose, may I introduce you to
my cousin, Sir John?

601
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,190
Come.

602
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,400
~ Edith, darling!
~ Excuse me.

603
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,510
We'd better act fast
before it all hits the rocks.

604
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,550
Everything seems to be
hitting the rocks at the moment.

605
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,030
~ That's a bit sad.
~ I mean it.

606
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,910
Sybil was my ally and she's gone.
Now Rose.

607
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,150
You're about to leave
and take Sybbie with you.

608
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,590
~ It's too much to bear.
~ Mary, I must live my life.

609
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,870
What? And leave me alone with Edith?

610
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,480
When you read I'm on trial
for murder, it'll be your fault.

611
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,670
Maybe you're right
and it wasn't a joke,

612
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,870
but all I care about
is you should believe me.

613
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,510
Of course I do, but it's almost worse
to know there's someone out there

614
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,910
who hates us enough
to concoct such a lie.

615
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,910
~ Tell us more about British India.
~ It's a wonderful country.

616
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,790
Bombay is a marvellous city.

617
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,670
I'm not sure how long
British India has to go.

618
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,310
We heard about that terrible
Amritsar business.

619
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,790
Amritsar was a very
unfortunate incident,

620
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,710
ordered by a foolish man.

621
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,910
I can't agree. General Dyer
was just doing his duty.

622
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,630
~ You haven't got that quite right.
~ We're entitled to our own opinion.

623
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,680
Are we? I hesitate to remind you that
Shrimpie knows India and you don't.

624
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,950
You look very serious.

625
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,590
Granny, do you think Lord Sinderby

626
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,030
would try anything horrible
to prevent the wedding?

627
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,230
He'd certainly like it stopped.

628
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,870
But he does love Atticus.

629
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,280
My dear, love is a far more
dangerous motive than dislike.

630
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,630
Go on. It's no fun on my own.

631
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,120
~ You never talked to me from the time
we got there. ~ Go and get changed.

632
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,350
Why are you bullying him,
Miss Denker?

633
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,390
Can't you pick on
someone your own age?

634
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,950
He'll have fun when he gets there.

635
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,390
Maybe, but I suspect you're
a bad influence all the same.

636
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,760
Then I suspect we have something
in common, Mr Barrow.

637
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,790
Cheeky.

638
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,310
If it was so lovely, why have you
been in a gloom since you got back?

639
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,110
It showed me what I've been missing.

640
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,710
Before I started studying I thought
history, art or 'owt like that

641
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,750
were only for the family, not for us.

642
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,470
Surely it's a good thing,
if your horizons have expanded?

643
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,070
In a way, but it's shown me how
empty my life's been until now.

644
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,670
You've learned a trade.
You're skilled.

645
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,510
You're an artist yourself.
Look at this wedding cake.

646
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,590
What for? So I can skivvy in
a kitchen that isn't even mine?

647
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,110
Wasn't it your plan to study so you
could help run Mr Mason's farm?

648
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,630
But even if I do that in the end,
wouldn't I be better studying here,

649
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,470
with galleries and libraries
and theatres all around me?

650
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,830
I could get a job in London,
I know I could.

651
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,350
~ I'm sure you could.
~ Then that's it.

652
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,240
I've made my mind up.
I'm handing in my notice.

653
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,190
Oh... Oh, Daisy.

654
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,030
You've been very good to me,
Mrs Patmore,

655
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,880
and I'll be sad to say goodbye,
but I think it's right.

656
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,630
Hasn't she brushed it off
as a malicious trap?

657
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,870
Yes, she has, but who would do it?

658
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,150
Granny thinks it might
be Lord Sinderby.

659
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,510
Ought we to challenge him?

660
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,910
~ Can I give you a nightcap?
~ Yes, please.

661
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,110
Not for me. I'm tired.

662
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,910
Ah, and you?

663
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,320
No, but I'll look in
to say good night.

664
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,510
~ Where are Miss Denker and Andrew?
~ Not back yet, Mr Carson.

665
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,910
I said I wanted everyone in
by ten o'clock.

666
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,630
~ I'm sure they won't be long.
~ Hmm!

667
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,150
~ Where have they got to?
~ God knows. It's hard for Mr Carson.

668
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,190
Miss Denker's not under
his jurisdiction.

669
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,630
Andy won't be round long enough
to mind a black mark.

670
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,990
She's using him in some way,
that lad, to her own benefit.

671
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,270
Which I do not like to see.

672
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,350
Cocoa if anyone wants it?

673
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,030
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

674
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,790
You should have let me do that.

675
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,590
I shall have to manage without you.
I may as well get used to it.

676
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,870
Don't be like that.

677
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,880
I'm not 'like' anything.
I'm just facing facts.

678
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,110
What are you doing in here?

679
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,160
~ Waiting for you.
~ I can't think why.

680
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,350
Did you enjoy this evening?

681
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,350
Not really, no. In fact, I hated it.

682
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,190
Having to play act in front of
those people is so degrading.

683
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,910
It's not for much longer.

684
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,470
~ Did you know that Anne Melford was
Jewish? ~ I neither knew nor didn't
know. What difference does it make?

685
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,070
No need to parade your
pseudo-tolerance here.

686
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,030
~ We are quite alone.
~ I don't feel as you do about it.

687
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,270
Or about anything else.

688
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,470
I want no more of your tricks.
Is that clear?

689
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,230
I don't know what you mean.

690
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,950
Yes, you do, and if you
don't promise to behave,

691
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,910
I will tell Rose and we'll see
what she makes of it.

692
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,190
~ You're talking in riddles.
~ You set up Atticus.

693
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,150
The whole cheap, dirty episode
began and ended with you.

694
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,350
Just because Rose was
too clever to be taken in,

695
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,990
doesn't mean she'd forgive you.

696
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,310
Are you ill?

697
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,710
I was curious to know about
the payment you spoke of.

698
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,230
I read the chequebook stub
and telephoned the firm.

699
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,960
Get down, you cat!

700
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,710
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

701
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,360
That we have lost our money...

702
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,950
.. that we have lost our position

703
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,510
that we have lost everything
the children have grown up

704
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,120
expecting as their right.

705
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,910
And now you want Rose
to be an outcast?

706
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,750
I'm not saying everything
will be easy for them,

707
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,310
but who has a life where
everything is easy?

708
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,590
~ Not us.
~ And God knows not her.

709
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,550
Don't mention the divorce
until after she's tied the knot.

710
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,150
Do you think he'd put his foot down
at the eleventh hour?

711
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,190
I'm warning you,
if this marriage does not go ahead,

712
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Rose will know the part you played.

713
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,070
Since we're all here, I've decided
what to do about the cottages.

714
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,150
I'm going to sell
the Della Francesca.

715
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,310
I've been to Sotheby's
and we'll get a good price.

716
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,710
Are you sure?
You've always been so proud of it.

717
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,870
I don't enjoy it as I did.

718
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,870
My Papa always said one should only
sell for a purpose and I agree.

719
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,710
The good of the village
can be that purpose.

720
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,550
I'm pleased. Now we can get on with
the work as soon as we're home.

721
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,800
Shall we?

722
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,310
I've spoiled the painting for you,
haven't I, with Mr Bricker?

723
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,110
That's why you're selling.

724
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,710
Yes.

725
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,000
But not in the way you think.

726
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,630
Every time I look at it,
I am reminded that I didn't trust you

727
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,560
and I feel so angry with myself,
I want to be rid of it.

728
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,750
Oh, that is a horrid trick!

729
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,510
Whoever thought it up
has a nasty mind.

730
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,790
What shocks me most is that anyone
could want me to be so unhappy.

731
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,240
Excuse me.

732
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,830
This is what troubles me,
would I be right to marry Dickie

733
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,950
when I know his sons
would hate us to be happy?

734
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,230
That's all very well, but let them
cheat you of your future?

735
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,470
I am sorry to disturb you, m'lady,
but Miss Denker is not well,

736
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,150
so Miss Baxter will
look after you tonight.

737
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,870
~ Will she be all right?
~ It's nothing serious, m'lady.

738
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,670
Thank you.

739
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,470
At last I have a plan,
start the work in the village,

740
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,190
find the new agent
and set off for America.

741
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,710
But won't all that take months?

742
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,160
Why don't we say I'll stay
for Christmas then go?

743
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,150
It's a dagger in my heart.

744
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,990
I don't know what
I'll do without you.

745
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:58,230
Did you ever think you'd say that
when I drove you to your fittings?

746
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,950
And Sybil got her to make evening
pyjamas and Granny almost fainted.

747
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,670
We have our memories, you and I.

748
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,990
But now you'll take them away
with you to Boston.

749
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,560
And I'll cherish them
when I get there.

750
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,790
~ It's a long way to Tipperary.
~ I think you need to calm down.

751
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:23,350
~ You need to calm down, Miss Denker.
~ To go...

752
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,270
Go and get Mrs Hughes.

753
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,150
To Tipperary...

754
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,910
~ Oh, I must get up to my lady.
~ No, I'm doing it.

755
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,430
~ Mr Carson's told her you're ill.
~ Ill?

756
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,430
Really, Miss Denker.
And in front of the maids, too!

757
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,510
Well, who gives a tinker's curse
about the maids?

758
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,870
Right. That's quite enough of that.

759
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,590
~ And as for you, where have you been?
~ You don't want to know.

760
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,830
Put on your livery
and get to the drawing room.

761
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,150
Maybe if I made her coffee,
it might sober her up.

762
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,600
Anything's worth a try.

763
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,950
~ Mrs Patmore? Whatever's the matter?
~ Don't mind me.

764
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,790
~ Tell me!
~ No. It wouldn't be fair.

765
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,390
Fair to who?

766
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,350
~ To you, you daft ha'porth.
~ I don't understand.

767
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,550
I'm crying because
I don't want you to leave.

768
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,480
I'll miss you.

769
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,070
Don't... don't concern yourself.
I'll get over it.

770
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,230
I'll work out a month's notice.

771
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,430
I have to come back for
the memorial ceremony,

772
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,550
and I haven't got another job yet.

773
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,470
Forget the coffee.
She's gone up, thank the Lord.

774
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,480
~ We should go, too.
~ You're right.

775
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,720
~ Has something happened?
~ No. Not yet.

776
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,790
Ah, you've come back, then?
We thought you'd run away to sea.

777
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,630
I'm very sorry, Mr Carson,
but Miss Denker was taken ill.

778
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,910
Never mind "taken ill,"
I wish she'd been taken away.

779
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,390
By the men in white coats.

780
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,080
Go down, Mr Carson. We'll manage.

781
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,030
What happened?

782
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,590
She took me to this horrible club
somewhere off Shaftesbury Avenue.

783
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,350
~ And I suppose you gambled.
~ I lost the lot.

784
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,790
I paid for it on the note
but it'll take all my savings.

785
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,390
I bet she didn't lose a thing? Hmm.

786
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,870
One question,
she's not made a play for you?

787
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,310
Done anything improper?

788
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,430
No! God no. No, nothing like that.
She just sat and drank.

789
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,870
~ They gave her whatever she wanted.
~ I see.

790
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,630
At least, I think I see.
Next time I'm coming with you.

791
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,990
~ Does there have to be a next time?
~ Yes. Just one more.

792
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,560
I'm fairly sure
you're gonna enjoy it.

793
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,510
I dare say this is
a first for you, Granny,

794
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,270
to sample the joys of
a registry office.

795
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,950
You'd be quite wrong, no, in 1878

796
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,110
I attended the wedding of
Lord Rosebery and Hannah Rothschild

797
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,950
held in the Board of Guardians,
very much the same.

798
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,270
It seems almost sad in a way.

799
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,190
But in marrying a Rothschild,
there are certain compensations.

800
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,550
Is Lady Flintshire all right?

801
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,470
Cora, would you go and help Susan?
She seems in rather a queer way.

802
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,270
There is something
that you must know

803
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,790
and I feel most uncomfortable
not having told you before now.

804
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,670
We don't want any
deathbed confessions, Susan.

805
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,270
Remember, this is not your day!

806
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,910
I'm sorry, Aunt Violet.
I think it's time.

807
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,470
In fact, it's long overdue.

808
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,870
~ What is?
~ No, please.

809
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,150
Shrimpie and I are in the process
of getting a divorce.

810
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,270
What?!

811
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,830
I'm afraid it is going to be all
over the papers and as things stand,

812
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,390
it must involve you and your family.

813
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,950
~ God if I...
~ Thank you, Lady Flintshire.

814
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,870
Or may I call you Susan?

815
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:50,110
We are forewarned
and so now we will be forearmed.

816
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,070
~ You can't mean...
~ Father, I beg you...

817
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,830
Do anything to stop this marriage,
anything at all, I will leave you,

818
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,520
and then you will have a scandal
worthy of the name!

819
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:14,310
Oh, I doubt you expected
to take your beloved child

820
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,350
through the portals of
Caxton Hall Registry Office.

821
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,230
There are lots of things
in my life I never anticipated,

822
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,800
but if you're sure, I'm sure.

823
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,310
By the way, Atticus was blameless.

824
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,990
I'm ashamed now that I wobbled.

825
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,190
~ I know he was blameless.
~ How can you know?

826
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,390
Well I do, beyond a trace of doubt.

827
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,310
Who did my enemy turn out to be?

828
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,430
Never mind about that.
You don't know him. Not properly.

829
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,390
Then I don't want to know.

830
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,470
I don't want to hate anyone today.

831
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,910
You do realise
this is my real wedding?

832
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,480
~ Not the blessing this afternoon?
~ This is where I become his wife.

833
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:01,280
And I hope you will be very,
very happy, my dearest darling.

834
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,910
I don't believe it. Is that it?

835
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,590
Am I just expected
to be a good loser?

836
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,030
It's too late for that, my dear,
far too late.

837
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,960
Please stand.

838
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,790
Er, listen everyone,
as soon as they've finished lunch,

839
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,390
they'll get ready for
the blessing at half past two.

840
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,230
Those of you going to the Savoy Chapel,

841
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,670
there'll be a coach to bring you
for the reception.

842
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,710
~ What about dinner, Mr Carson?
~ Er, Just family.

843
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,390
Her ladyship wants a buffet
of what's left over.

844
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,070
I might add some hot soup.

845
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,230
I should go.
I'm helping Lady Rose to change.

846
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,470
I don't think it's right
to put on a wedding dress

847
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,990
when it's only a blessing.

848
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,630
~ She won't wear a veil.
~ You're right. We should get on.

849
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,790
So, we should be able to get away
later on if you're up for it.

850
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,070
~ After her ladyship's gone to bed.
~ You mean you want to come?

851
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,390
You've been having lots of fun,
Miss Denker.

852
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,910
~ Unless you feel the worse for wear?
~ I don't know what you mean.

853
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,070
I had a headache, that's all.

854
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,430
~ If he's coming, you needn't bother.
~ No! We want Andy with us.

855
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,310
~ With you for what?
~ Nothing, Mrs Hughes.

856
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,910
Andy, you take your
life in your hands

857
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,320
if you throw in your lot
with these two.

858
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,710
Lord Sinderby, please believe
that I love your son very much

859
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,230
and whatever I can do to
make him happy, I will do.

860
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,920
We know that, my dear, and we wish
every blessing on your head.

861
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,800
Well, well, the thing is done.
Let us go forward in hope.

862
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,910
Ah, look who's coming your way.

863
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,710
Hello, Tony. How lovely to see you.
And you of course, Mabel.

864
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,350
~ Welcome.
~ Are we welcome? I hope so.

865
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,320
You're as welcome here as I trust
I will be at your wedding.

866
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,390
~ Is it just me who's embarrassed?
~ I'm not embarrassed.

867
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,630
We're getting married in December.
We'd be delighted to see you there.

868
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,870
~ Oh, I am so pleased. Truly.
~ It'll be in London.

869
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,560
Country weddings in the winter
can be such muddy affairs.

870
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,030
I don't suppose we'll ever know
who did it now but who cares?

871
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,710
~ It wasn't my father.
~ Oh, I never thought it was.

872
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,110
I mean, I know he's against me,

873
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,510
but that sort of thing's
not his style.

874
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,470
You see? She already knows you
better than he does.

875
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,230
I'm not sure it's what
she really wanted,

876
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,350
a registry office
and the Savoy chapel.

877
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,030
~ But, I think she'll be very happy.
~ I agree. They're well matched.

878
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,390
~ When are you going home?
~ First thing. I can't wait.

879
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,230
~ The call of young Marigold.
~ You sound as if you don't approve.

880
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,270
Oh, it's not that...

881
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:33,830
Oh, look. It's Tony and Mary.
They make a handsome couple.

882
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,680
Give it up, Papa. It's a pipe dream.

883
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,710
So, it turned out as you planned.

884
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,910
You were just what I needed
when I needed it.

885
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,750
~ I hope you know that.
~ Well, I know a lot of things.

886
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,590
One of them is not to mess
with Lady Mary Crawley.

887
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,630
But everything's come right?

888
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,800
Hmm, it has for me.
I hope it does for you, too.

889
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,440
Good luck, Mary.

890
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,630
Lord Sinderby has taken Brancaster
Castle for the grouse this year.

891
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,830
In Northumberland?

892
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,750
Yes, and we wondered if you
might like to join us there?

893
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,190
~ That's very kind. ~ All of you.
It would give us great pleasure.

894
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,670
All of us? I wonder if you know
what you're taking on!

895
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,830
I'll telephone Lady Grantham
and we'll talk dates.

896
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,480
I look forward to it.

897
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,150
That wasn't too hard, was it?

898
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,950
~ Not hard for me, since I was allowed
no say in the matter. ~ None at all.

899
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,400
~ He seems like a wonderful boy.
~ Thank you, that's very kind.

900
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,870
I heard about your declaration
at the registry office.

901
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,550
All I want is your happiness,
my darling.

902
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:48,390
Whatever I said or did
was done from love.

903
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,360
I'm afraid we must have different
definitions of the word.

904
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,230
Hmm.

905
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,510
How are you two bearing up?

906
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,430
Well, thank you, Lady Manville.

907
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,710
I do feel for you.

908
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,790
It must be very trying,

909
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,030
but I so admire you
for putting on a good face.

910
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,790
I wonder if you remember
that my father was Jewish?

911
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,310
Oh.

912
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,680
I'm afraid I...

913
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,760
That is... How interesting...

914
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,800
Ah, Louise, I wasn't expecting
to find you here.

915
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,150
~ Is everything all right, m'lady?
~ I thought I'd sneak away.

916
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,470
~ I don't think I'll be missed.
~ Oh, I wouldn't say that.

917
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,030
I feel as if our household
is breaking up, Carson,

918
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,870
but I suppose that's what happens.

919
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,830
People grow up and move away
and things change.

920
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:55,110
I hope Lord Gillingham
hasn't upset you?

921
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,790
Oh, no.

922
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,190
He's happy with Miss Lane Fox
and I'm happy for them.

923
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,190
Because if I might be
permitted to say so?

924
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,190
He wasn't good enough for you,
m'lady, not by half.

925
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,950
I don't think anyone else
would agree with you.

926
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,150
But the difference is
that you agree with me.

927
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,710
I watched you realise it
as time went on.

928
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,790
Reluctantly perhaps,

929
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:21,510
but you came to see that
he wasn't up to the mark.

930
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,470
I'm not sure if that's
alarming or reassuring

931
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,830
coming from someone
who knows me so well.

932
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,310
Reassuring I hope, for I'm confident
that you will triumph in the end.

933
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:36,520
Thank you, Carson.
That means more to me than you know.

934
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,110
Oh no, it was a funny marriage.

935
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,430
No proper service, no veil!

936
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,790
You'd have thought
one of them was divorced.

937
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,590
I wish them well.
I don't mind Lady Rose, me.

938
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,400
~ Is this it?
~ Welcome to the Velvet Violin.

939
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:56,630
Thank you.

940
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,350
We'll go in separately.

941
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,390
Don't talk to me
'til we're at the tables.

942
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,110
Back again, Miss Denker?

943
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,830
I've brought two with me.
The new boy and another one.

944
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,870
So I see. Give yourself a drink
and help 'em find the tables.

945
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,320
Thank you.

946
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,800
What's his name?
The one she was talking to.

947
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,550
Erm, Basil Shute. Why?

948
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,350
You'll see.

949
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,750
Are you going to play?

950
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,590
I might have a go. Pontoon's my game.

951
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,000
But don't you. Right?

952
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,030
That was quite a marathon,
but I think a happy one.

953
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,470
Oh, yes. They're well suited.

954
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,470
They were bound to find out
in the end about Lady Rose's parents.

955
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,230
~ At least it's out in the open.
~ They'll have to lump it.

956
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,830
Now that Lord Sinderby and
Lady Flintshire both have a reason

957
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,710
to look down on the other,
that should keep them quiet.

958
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,270
Yes?

959
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,630
I beg your pardon, m'lady,
but Anna's wanted downstairs.

960
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,150
What do you mean, Mrs Hughes?
I haven't dismissed her.

961
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,630
I know, m'lady and I feel
most uncomfortable but...

962
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,630
~ What is it? What's happened?
~ Mr Vyner's downstairs.

963
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,270
~ What?
~ But he hasn't...

964
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,800
He says he's come to arrest you.

965
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,470
~ Does that always happen?
~ Not always, no.

966
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,270
Right. Cash them in
and pay your bill.

967
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:34,030
~ I couldn't let you do that.
~ Why not?

968
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,030
~ You want to get out of here alive?
~ I'd have to pay you back.

969
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,630
We'll argue later.
Off you go while I see to Mr Shute.

970
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,160
~ What do you mean?
~ Go.

971
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,150
Excuse me,

972
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,350
can you tell me which of these
knuckleheads is a Mr Basil Shute?

973
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,670
Why?

974
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,950
There's a woman who's boasting of
a trick she's played on him all week.

975
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,910
Oh, yeah? What's that, then?

976
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,470
Yeah, she erm, she waits outside
until someone's coming in,

977
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,270
then she enters with them

978
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,270
and claims free drinks all night
for bringing in new punters.

979
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,110
Oh, she does, does she?

980
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,590
It's the woman I arrived with.

981
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,630
Bye!

982
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:13,440
No! Wait!

983
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,310
Bye.

984
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,350
She chose me because she thought

985
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,670
I was too young and stupid
to see what she was at.

986
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,280
And she was right, wasn't she?
So, next time, ask your Uncle Thomas.

987
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,960
Right, let's go.

988
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,910
Oh, thank you.

989
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:36,750
Haven't you forgotten something?

990
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,350
What?

991
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,270
Your bill for three nights' worth
of drinking, Miss Denker.

992
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,350
That'll be four pounds
and ten shillings.

993
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,630
I must wait for Mr Bates.
I can't go without telling him!

994
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,750
It might be kinder
if you let him hear the news

995
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,790
when he can't say anything
he'll regret.

996
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,390
~ I forbid you to take her!
~ Correct forms have been observed.

997
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,510
~ What is this? What's happening?
~ Don't make trouble, Mr Bates.

998
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:01,390
~ You can't do this!
~ Try to keep calm.

999
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,790
~ Can't I stand surety for her?
~ I'm afraid not, sir.

1000
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,790
~ Mrs Hughes, will you fetch her coat?
~ No! I can't let her go.

1001
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,270
A witness has identified Mrs Bates

1002
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,710
being on the pavement
near Mr Green before he fell.

1003
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,270
~ I insist on telephoning our lawyer!
~ Telephone all you like, Miss.

1004
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,630
He'll find Mrs Bates at
Gerald Row Police Station.

1005
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,790
I suggest you leave it
'til the morning.

1006
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,390
I will ring him now because
she is innocent and I am not "Miss"!

1007
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,110
I am Lady Mary Crawley!

1008
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,950
I don't care if you're
the Queen of the Upper Nile.

1009
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,270
I'm going and she's coming with me.

1010
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,720
Now!

1011
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,880
Bates!

1012
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,550
"They fell with
their faces to the fold.

1013
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,670
"They shall grow not old,
as we that are left grow old.

1014
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,070
"Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

1015
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,910
"At the going down of the sun
and in the morning.

1016
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,750
"We will remember them."

1017
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,990
We will remember them.

1018
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,230
Stand at ease.

1019
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,760
Stand easy.

1020
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:02,990
Before you disperse, I would beg
your indulgence for a moment.

1021
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,230
Can I draw your attention
to one more gallant chap

1022
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,750
who volunteered to fight?

1023
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,870
He wasn't local to Downton and so his
name does not appear on the memorial,

1024
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,030
but his memory is cherished
by some here,

1025
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,230
and so it seems right to us
to mark his passing.

1026
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,680
Mrs Patmore?

1027
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,600
Oh!

1028
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,720
"Sacrifice" is right.

1029
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,190
I think that's lovely, Mrs Patmore.
I'm so pleased for you.

1030
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,750
It's just as it should be.

1031
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,800
I believe so.

1032
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,880
I'd like to see William's name now.
If you've a moment, Daisy?

1033
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:39,470
My sister's going to
find it a real comfort.

1034
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,190
It'll be nice for you too, Daisy,
to have the memorial so near.

1035
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:48,990
I thought I'd feel sad when I read
William's name, and so I did.

1036
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,870
But I felt proud, too.

1037
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,790
~ Very proud.
~ Of course.

1038
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,510
Daisy may not be here forever,

1039
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,510
but that won't mean she's any
the less proud of our William.

1040
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,950
~ What? Are you going away, Daisy?
~ Well no, there's nothing wrong.

1041
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,350
She's got a taste for London,

1042
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,550
so we'll have to learn
to manage without her.

1043
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,870
At her age, it's right she should
have a new adventure, isn't it?

1044
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:14,150
~ Is this true, Daisy?
~ No, she's just teasing!

1045
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,550
At least, I did think about it,

1046
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,790
but I've decided
I'm not going anywhere,

1047
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,390
or not until after
I've passed my exams.

1048
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,790
I'm glad.

1049
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,760
I hate it when people who love
each other must be far apart.

1050
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,600
I know what you're thinking.

1051
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,630
It is not hard to guess, m'lady.

1052
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,150
She won't be convicted.
I don't even think she'll be tried.

1053
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,510
~ They have nothing to go on.
~ Nothing they're sharing with us.

1054
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,390
But you're right, m'lady,
she will not be convicted.

1055
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:01,030
Now we're back, do you really think
I should put up a fight for Dickie?

1056
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:05,190
You said you wouldn't do anything
'til after Rose's wedding.

1057
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,870
But, it's over,
so it's time for action.

1058
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:12,870
Fighting talk, indeed.

1059
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:16,080
And will you put up a fight
for Prince Kuragin?

1060
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,670
Well, you forget,
you hold the winning card.

1061
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,070
Lord Merton's wife is dead.

1062
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,150
I always forget how much
I enjoy London.

1063
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,790
You should go up more often,
take an interest in your publishing.

1064
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:33,350
You should get involved in
the running of the business.

1065
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,150
You're clever and a good writer.
They're lucky to have you.

1066
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,310
Mary always talks like
she's the only one

1067
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,670
who'll miss you when you go,
but you know I will, too.

1068
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,230
And I'll miss you.

1069
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,750
Poor Mr Bates. They locked him up
when he was innocent.

1070
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,030
Why shouldn't they do
the same with his wife?

1071
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,910
I have faith in British justice.
Mr Bates was released in the end.

1072
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,230
After he'd served time.

1073
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:02,270
Sorrow seems to shadow them both
and in their wake, it shadows us.

1074
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,510
Come, Mrs Hughes.
This isn't like you.

1075
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:10,280
Take courage for their sake.
We must always travel in hope.

1076
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:15,310
I realised what it is about Marigold
that keeps catching my eye.

1077
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,990
Oh, yes? What's that?

1078
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,200
She reminds me of Michael Gregson.

1079
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,310
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

1080
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,040
You're not wrong.

1081
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,190
~ Don't tell Edith you've guessed.
~ Why not?

1082
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:31,630
It makes things a good deal
clearer than they were.

1083
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,390
Just don't. Not yet.
Mary doesn't know either, nor Tom.

1084
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,720
Let it be Edith's secret
a little while longer.

1085
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,390
Very well.

1086
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,190
I must admit it's
an unusual sensation

1087
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,390
to learn there's a secret in
this house I'm actually privy to.

1088
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,200
But, I'll be silent if you wish.

1089
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,280
And you'll love her?
Your new granddaughter?

1090
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,950
As a matter of fact,
and perhaps to my surprise,

1091
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,600
I rather think I will.

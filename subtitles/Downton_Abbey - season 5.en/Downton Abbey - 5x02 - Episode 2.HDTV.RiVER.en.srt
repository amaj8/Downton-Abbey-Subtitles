1
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Wait one moment.

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
She can decide whether or not she
wants to throw these away.

3
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Quite right.

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
But how would it be funded?

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,350
There's quite a lot in the kitty
and we'd have another campaign.

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,470
There'll be plenty of volunteers to
keep up standards.

7
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,790
For how long? And what about the
cricket?

8
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,550
We'd have to re-site the pitch, My
Lord. Of course it would take work

9
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,870
~ but we've got until the summer.
~ Think what we're gaining.

10
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,910
A beautiful garden of remembrance.

11
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,470
Where people can walk and sit
and think about their loved ones.

12
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,510
They can come here from all around

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,150
and spend an hour with their sacred
memories in peace and at rest.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,390
This pitch has been prepared over
years

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,710
with a great deal of work for the
cricket.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,870
That field below Peckham wood could
be made into a pitch.

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,710
Surely the right place is in the
village where people pass every day.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,870
Will it be peaceful and quiet?
A fit place for mourning?

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,430
It's what they're doing in Sowerby
and I'm certain it's where most of
them will be.

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,350
And is our memorial to be no better
than most of them?

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,910
It comes down to priorities,
Lord Grantham.

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,680
Which is more important, a game of
cricket or the loss of a son in the
course of his duty?

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,070
Well, this is it, then.

24
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,120
There's something I wanna say.

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,830
I'm sorry I put you through all that
trouble.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,870
Forget it.

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,310
~ It's in t'past. ~ Well, you've been a
good friend to me, Thomas.

28
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,470
If anyone had told me that I'd have
been friends with a...

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,720
man like you I'd have not believed
them.

30
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
But we have been friends.

31
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,640
And I'm sad to see the back of you.
I am.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,670
We can always write.

33
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,400
I'm not much at letter writing.
I'll do me best.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,230
But in case we don't meet again...

35
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
I hope you find some happiness.

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,270
I do, truly.

37
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,310
I hope the same for you too, Jimmy.

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,360
I'll be dandy.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'd best be off.

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,430
~ I'm sorry Jimmy's gone.
~ I know.

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,150
It were nice having a bonny face
about the house.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,870
We'll have to make do with Mr
Molesley.

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,910
How are you studies going?

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,870
~ Slowly. ~ It's bound to be hard when
you've not been at school for a
while.

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,910
It's not hard, it's impossible.

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,950
But what's the answer?

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is the pudding ready to go up?

48
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,990
~ Mrs Patmore? The pudding.
~ Sorry. I was miles away.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,040
There's a sauce to go with that.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,150
On one tray or will Mr Barrow help?

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,070
One tray, please. I can't be
bothered to fight with him.

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
Jimmy, where are you when we need
you?

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,150
~ Ooh, Mr Carson.
~ What is it now?

54
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,710
Now that Jimmy, erm, James, has
gone,

55
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,110
do I take it that I am now
first footman?

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,270
Since you are the only footman, you
are first, second, third and last.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,310
Make what you will of it.

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,110
Mr Moseley, we are nearly at the end
of those distinctions.

59
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,950
There will come a time when a
household is lucky to boast any
footman.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Now get that up to the dining room.

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,550
Did it not go well this morning?

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,670
I was disappointed, if you must
know.

63
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
But it's early days.

64
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,470
George is coming on so fast.

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,910
It's wonderful how they seem to
change week by week at his age.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,110
He's rather sweet, isn't he?

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,550
How are you getting on with repairing
the fire damage?

68
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,870
Oh, they're all being marvellous
but I do feel such an idiot.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,190
Maybe because you behaved like an
idiot.

70
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,110
The good thing is it'll be sorted
out in a day or two.

71
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,230
~ I got this letter from Charles
Blake? ~ What does he want?

72
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,750
An art historian he knows is writing
a book on della Francesca.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,790
He wasn't aware we had one of his
paintings at Downton.

74
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,830
He's desperate to see it.

75
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,190
I assume it's just an excuse so
Charles can pay court to Mary.

76
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,230
He doesn't want to come. He wrote to
introduce his friend Simon Bricker.

77
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,590
~ I can invite Charles if you'd like.
~ I don't mind either way.

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,950
I will ask him. We don't know Mr
Bricker. It might be easier if
Charles was here.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,910
~ Don't forget I'm away from Tuesday.
~ I wish I knew where you were going.

80
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,950
I haven't a clue. I expect we'll
drive around for a few days

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,470
and stop and sketch when we see a
view we like.

82
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,590
~ Who's this with?
~ Annabelle Portsmouth. It'll be fun.

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,550
How was your morning, Papa? Have you
decided where to put the memorial?

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,590
~ No.
~ Carson?

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,630
Not yet, my lady.

86
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
It's difficult to please everyone.

87
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,550
Bella Davis telephoned to talk about
her work with Russian refugees in
York.

88
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,670
~ Are there many Russian refugees in
York? ~ I'm afraid so.

89
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,710
They're scattered all over Europe.

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,270
Trying to establish communities to
save their culture after the ravages
of revolution.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,310
Ghastly for them, eh, Tom?

92
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,350
I feel sorry for anyone exiled from
their own country.

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,390
I pity those who stayed behind

94
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,350
only to be tortured and murdered in
their thousands.

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,390
Leave him alone, Papa.

96
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,430
I was at the hospital today

97
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,270
and Mrs Henderson has done the most
generous thing

98
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,830
and given a wireless to the ward so
that they can listen to music and
the news

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,750
and sometimes even a play. I can't
tell you how it brightens things up.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,270
I'm told that they're far more
efficient now

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,310
~ and much easier to tune.
~ No.

102
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,040
~ But...I haven't asked anything.
~ No.

103
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,400
Shall we go through and let the
servants get in here?

104
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,870
Hello.

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Dawn raid?

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,190
Look who it is. Come on, my lady.

107
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,230
Hello, Mrs Drewe.

108
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,280
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

109
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,070
Hello, darling.

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,680
Hello. How are you?

111
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,110
Why don't you sit there, my lady?

112
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,670
Have they started cleaning up after
the fire?

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,710
They're doing it now. Thank heaven it
was only my room.

114
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,750
God, I was stupid.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,710
It's wonderful the interest you take
in her, my lady.

116
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,280
Perhaps you'll keep an eye on her as
she grows.

117
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm sure I will.

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,510
It would be a blessing if you would.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,830
After all, she's almost a foundling.
No parents of her own.

120
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,670
~ No family, no-one to turn to.
~ What are you saying?

121
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,710
We're her family now?

122
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,270
I know. But there's a limit to what
we can do with three of our own.

123
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,670
I don't understand you. Marigold is
one of our own.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,550
~ Or very nearly. ~ All I'm saying is
her ladyship could prove to be a
real blessing

125
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,590
if she'd only take an interest.

126
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,720
She seems a bright little thing to
me.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,590
~ Well, I'd have to think about it.
~ Course you will.

128
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,760
Because if people get used to seeing
you together, you can't just duck
out.

129
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,830
That's why we must think carefully
and only take it on if I'm sure.

130
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,430
You could be a sort of godmother.

131
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,470
That's it.

132
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,990
~ Yes, I could be Marigold's godmother.
~ She's got a godmother.

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,150
We had her christened and my
sister's -

134
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,790
Talk it over with his lordship,
why don't you?

135
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,510
~ See what he thinks. ~ Maybe I could
take her up to the house to visit my
niece and nephew.

136
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,750
My eye. How lucky would she be?

137
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,190
It is all very good of you, my lady,
I'm sure.

138
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
Give it a thought. Then we'll see.

139
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,190
~ Sorry. ~ Dr Clarkson has just been
telling me about the latest report
of the drug insulin.

140
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,310
~ Oh. ~ It's going to make a great
difference to many lives.

141
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,870
~ I'm quite sure of that.
~ I agree.

142
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,830
We're a backwater here but, heaven
knows, we've our share of diabetes.

143
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,480
A diagnosis will no longer be a
death sentence.

144
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,710
I'm glad to see your old interests
are reasserting themselves.

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,030
~ Why do you say that? ~ Mrs Crawley's
been distracted lately.

146
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,350
With Lord Merton frisking around her
skirts and getting in the way.

147
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,390
You make too much of it.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,070
Do I? We've been invited to tea with
Lord Merton at Cavenham.

149
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,110
I opened the letter this morning.

150
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,550
Maybe you're the real quarry and
he's only hunting me to throw you
off the scent.

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,310
I may be older than I was but I can
still tell when a man is interested.

152
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,270
I believe Cavenham Park has some
beautiful gardens.

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,830
Though it's the wrong time of year
to see them.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,750
The promise of the gardens in summer
will be the final worm on the hook.

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,670
Honestly, I'm as good at being
teased as the next man

156
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
but even my sense of humour has its
limits.

157
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,590
Off you go, Miss Goody Two Shoes.

158
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,630
You can play the holy mother all you
like, you still nearly got me
sacked.

159
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,670
Leave her alone.

160
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,190
Oh, gallant Mr Molesley. She's never
told you though, has she?

161
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,150
Miss Baxter has had troubles in the
past

162
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,070
which you tried to use against her.
Until her ladyship put a stop to it.

163
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,040
~ That is all I need to know.
~ I knew she hadn't told you.

164
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,030
Barrow. Could you please tell Mrs
Patmore I'm here?

165
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,070
Very good, my lady.

166
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Mrs Patmore, Lady Rose.

167
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,070
A delicious dinner, Mrs Patmore.

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,110
Thank you very much.

169
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,150
You wanted a word?

170
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,070
Only if it's convenient, my lady.
But, you know that young woman who
works at the school?

171
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,230
~ Miss Bunting. Mr Branson's friend.
~ Yes. I didn't like to ask him in
case he found it awkward.

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,800
I was wondering if she might be
prepared to take on some extra work.

173
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,590
But suppose they telephone Lady
Portsmouth.

174
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,630
She's promised she'll cover for me.

175
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,150
I feel quite nervous. And I'm not
even going.

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,310
We'll choose the clothes carefully
so you can take them on and off
without my help.

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,350
Well, I'll have his help.

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,870
Honestly, my lady. You'd better hope
I never write my memoirs.

179
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,990
There is one thing I've got to ask
you.

180
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,000
~ I'm really sorry, but I must.
~ Go on.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,710
I have to sure there aren't
any...consequences.

182
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,750
What sort of consequences?

183
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,790
Well, you know.

184
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,830
No, I don't.

185
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,030
Oh, my God. Er...

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,070
I mean, I beg your pardon, my lady.

187
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,190
But you see I can't just go into a
shop and buy something.

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,240
What if I were recognised?

189
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,750
But I wouldn't know what to buy.

190
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I've thought of that.

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,190
I have a copy of Marie Stopes's
book.

192
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,230
It tells you everything.

193
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,110
Well, won't he take care of it?

194
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,680
I don't think one should rely on a
man in that department, do you?

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,310
~ But suppose I'm recognised?
~ But you won't be?

196
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,350
And even if you are, you're married.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,430
With a living husband.

198
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Why shouldn't you buy one?

199
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,470
Is it true that Lady Rose wants his
lordship to buy a wireless?

200
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,790
Whether he will or not's another
matter.

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,830
I like the idea of a wireless.

202
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,750
To hear people singing and talking in
London and all sorts.

203
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,870
What's so good about that when you
can go to a music hall in York?

204
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,910
I'd rather hear a live singer.

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,150
If you're looking for Miss Baxter,
she's still upstairs.

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,910
Why do you have to make everything
sound so nasty?

207
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,270
I'm nasty about Miss Baxter because
she came here to help me and she's
broken her word.

208
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I doubt that's how she'd put it.

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,750
Do you think with her past she'd
come near a house like this?

210
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,310
She'd be lucky to get work in a
public laundry.

211
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,760
~ I'm sure she's grateful. ~ Then she's
a funny way of showing it.

212
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
You do know she's a thief.

213
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,550
Stole her mistresses jewels.

214
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,590
There must be more to it than that.

215
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,830
No. She sneaked up to the bedroom,
snatched up the pieces,

216
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,350
pearl necklaces, diamond bracelets,
put them in her pockets.

217
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,320
Then tried to make it look as if
someone had broken in.

218
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,230
~ She was obviously unsuccessful.
~ They gave her five years but she
only served three.

219
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,670
Came out a few months before I
brought her up here so don't say she
doesn't owe me.

220
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,790
~ Has Mrs Bates come down yet?
~ Not yet.

221
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,550
We were just discussing your friend.
Miss Baxter.

222
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,590
Is she my friend particularly?

223
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,630
She seems to think so.

224
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,870
I know you mean to lead me into
further inquiry but I couldn't care
less what you think, Thomas.

225
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,030
~ On that subject or any other.
~ I agree.

226
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,070
No, you don't.

227
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,360
Cos you listened to the story,
didn't you?

228
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
What was that about?

229
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
Oh, nothing.

230
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,050
I must remember to organise a car to
meet Charles Blake and his friend.

231
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,890
~ They'll be here at teatime. ~ Are we a
hotel that never presents a bill?

232
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,930
You've already made that joke.

233
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,850
~ There you are. I need your advice.
~ How flattering. What is it?

234
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,250
~ Should I go?
~ No. No, it's not a secret.

235
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,970
I've been talking to Mr Drewe. Did
you know they've taken in a child?

236
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,970
~ The daughter of a friend who died.
~ How kind of them.

237
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:28,770
The girl is very endearing and I
think I'd like to be involved in her
future. To help her in some way.

238
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,890
Maybe with school fees or something.

239
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,810
I've money from my articles and
Grandpapa's trust.

240
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,970
Has Drewe put you up to this?

241
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,740
No. But I'd like to take an active
interest.

242
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,570
It'd be good for me.

243
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,450
It's your money. Do what you like
with it.

244
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,490
But you can't just give the child up
when you get bored.

245
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,530
I won't get bored.

246
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,180
Cousin Robert, did you see this
article about how wirelesses are
getting cheaper and more reliable?

247
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,300
~ No. ~ I just thought it was
interesting.

248
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,380
No.

249
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,410
What's Mr Branson's pal doing down
here?

250
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,450
Why? Don't you approve?

251
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,090
Last time she came, she gave them
all an earful.

252
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,930
I cannot solve the mystery. How are
you getting on with the memorial?

253
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,580
His Lordship is resisting the idea
of the garden.

254
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,690
~ You don't agree with him?
~ Well, as it happens, I do.

255
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,810
~ What? ~ I don't believe in your garden
of remembrance.

256
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,850
In a town, maybe.

257
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,610
But the Yorkshire scenery is our
garden of remembrance.

258
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,730
I'd prefer to see a memorial at the
heart of village life so we'd pass
it on the way to church or the shop

259
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,490
~ and give a thought to the boys who
fell. ~ You surprise me, Mrs Hughes.

260
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,970
I was disappointed in his Lordship,
but I'm more disappointed in you.

261
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,340
Every relationship has its ups and
downs.

262
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,250
Yes, miss.

263
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Erm...

264
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,660
Is there a lady I could deal with?

265
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,180
Very good, madam. If you'll just
wait there.

266
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,450
I've not quite made up my mind.
Why not serve the gentleman first?

267
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,780
That's kind of you. Packet of safety
razor blades, please.

268
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,460
~ That's sixpence, sir.
~ Thank you.

269
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,810
If we keep this up we'll have another
customer along soon.

270
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,460
Yes. Erm...

271
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
I would like to buy...

272
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
..one of these.

273
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,610
I can see you're married.

274
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,930
~ I am married, yes. ~ But you don't
with for any more children.

275
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,970
That's it. That's right.

276
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
There is always abstinence.

277
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,370
Of course there is but...

278
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,210
I don't want to take any risks
because of my health.

279
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,220
Oh, I see. Well, that does put a
slightly different colour on it.

280
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,660
Three and eleven.

281
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,570
~ Keep the change.
~ What about the instructions?

282
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,620
~ They can be very difficult to manage.
~ I'm sure it's perfect. Thank you.

283
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,410
I'll take half a crown a lesson.
That's five shillings a week.

284
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,650
You can use my sitting room if you
need somewhere private.

285
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,690
See you after school. Goodbye.

286
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,770
Wait a minute! That is Daisy's
busiest time.

287
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,330
~ I can't come any earlier. ~ Oh, well,
then. Perhaps - ~ I'm excited.

288
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,050
But I'll pay. It's not right that you
should waste your money on me.

289
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,970
~ No, I want to pay.
~ That's a nice thing you're doing.

290
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,210
Is it? Well, I think I've been a
damn fool and doubled me workload!

291
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,810
I wondered who was in here.

292
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,970
We're just sorting out some things
for Rose's refugees.

293
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,010
Poor Rose.

294
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,370
Why are you so against getting a
wireless?

295
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,690
I wish she'd just say it. "Cousin
Robert, please buy a wireless for
Downton."

296
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,610
~ I wouldn't mind.
~ That's because you're American.

297
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,050
I find the whole idea a kind of
thief of life.

298
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,810
People waste hours huddled around a
box listening to someone burbling
inanities from somewhere else.

299
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,850
But surely now with the latest news

300
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,010
and it must be a boon for the old.
What do you think, Bates?

301
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,730
I can't see the Dowager with a
wireless, my lady.

302
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,770
It's a fad. It won't last.

303
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
Oh, no. Not that one.

304
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,330
This is nice.

305
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,570
Lord Grantham said it was the
coldest house in Yorkshire.

306
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,610
Ah, you're here. I'm so pleased.

307
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,780
~ How charming it is.
~ Oh, we do our best.

308
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,530
I know it's the wrong time of year
but I would love to see the gardens.

309
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,370
Shouldn't we allow Lord Merton to
tell us how he's planned our visit?

310
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,410
~ Of course.
~ It is his house.

311
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes. I know that.

312
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,010
You've been very quiet all day.

313
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,700
~ Have I?
~ I wish you'd tell me what it is.

314
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Very well.

315
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,530
Last night Mr Barrow chose to give
me an account of your history.

316
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,570
He was bound to, sooner or later.

317
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,690
His version is a bleak one, which
will not surprise you.

318
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,090
~ What did he say? ~ Well, for a start,
he seemed to suggest

319
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,610
that you were in some sort
of...privileged position.

320
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,330
I was a trusted senior ladies maid
to a good woman

321
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,170
in a rich and respectable household.

322
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,610
But then he said that...you just
took your employer's jewels.

323
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,460
Snatched them up and put them into
your pocket.

324
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,490
I stole a pearl necklace with a ruby
clasp.

325
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,650
Two diamond bracelets and four
rings.

326
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,060
Did he tell you I tried to pretend
it was a burglary?

327
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,410
Well, then. I think you have all the
relevant information.

328
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,450
There must be something more.

329
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,610
There must have been a cause, a
reason for you to do such a thing.

330
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,050
~ What sort of cause? ~ I don't know.
Someone that you cared for

331
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,370
needed money for an emergency and
you were desperate to help.

332
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,330
I was a common thief, Mr Molesley.
A convicted criminal. A jailbird.

333
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,060
~ I don't believe you.
~ Because you don't want to.

334
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,500
I would only say that I am not that
person now.

335
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,610
When you've finished your tea, we
can walk the terraces, if you like.

336
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,650
That sounds ideal.

337
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,490
I recently read a book on the
science of quarantine

338
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,650
and I've been looking forward to
discussing it with you.

339
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,690
We mustn't bore Lady Grantham.

340
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,610
Oh, you're right. You see, I need
your guiding hand to keep me in
check.

341
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,530
Mrs Crawley is never happier than
when she has a chance to use her
guiding hand.

342
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
Are you, dear?

343
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,890
~ How pretty this room is.
~ Thank you.

344
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,210
Mama re-did all these rooms in the
'80s. She had good taste, I think.

345
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,570
Is one allowed to brag about one's
mother?

346
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,450
So the late Lady Merton didn't
change it?

347
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,290
Ada didn't use it much.

348
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,450
She thought it was draughty being so
near the front door.

349
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I suppose she had a point.

350
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,170
If you don't like being quite so
near the front door.

351
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,770
Well, I think it's enchanting.

352
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,810
It's a woman's room, though.

353
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,850
Of course.

354
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,410
The library and the dining room are
masculine

355
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,330
the drawing rooms and the music rooms
are feminine. Or so I was taught.

356
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,210
I meant that it needs a woman's
presence to make sense of it.

357
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,940
When I'm on my own in here I feel
like a bull in a china shop.

358
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,850
~ Why aren't you going with her?
~ What?

359
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,570
With Lady Mary? She'll be away for
almost a week.

360
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,010
Yes but they're driving round. They
don't know where they'll stay or
anything.

361
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,570
~ She and Lady Portsmouth? ~ Yes.
~ It doesn't sound like Lady Mary.

362
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,610
It sounds a bit bohemian.

363
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,050
I suppose she's allowed to get away
from it all if she wants to.

364
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,660
~ Like anyone.
~ Yes. I suppose she is.

365
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,010
What do you make of Edith's burst of
generosity with the Drewe girl?

366
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,730
In all probability her beloved
Gregson is dead and she has to sit
and watch her sisters' children play.

367
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,490
She wants someone to love. It's as
simple as that.

368
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,250
The problem will come when she has a
child of her own to distract her.

369
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,610
Let's cross that bridge when we come
to it.

370
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,140
And let's hope the Drewes don't get
sick of her in the meantime.

371
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,650
~ Was it ghastly?
~ I didn't know where to look.

372
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,010
But when I thought about it
afterwards it seemed unfair to
punish me like that.

373
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,530
Suppose I had eight children and
didn't want any more? Wouldn't I
have the right?

374
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,570
~ I agree completely. ~ I feel like
going back and ordering a baker's
dozen.

375
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,620
One's enough for now.

376
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,210
~ Mr Bricker.
~ This is wonderfully kind of you.

377
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,330
You can see the painting now or
after dinner or wait until tomorrow.
It's entirely up to you.

378
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,170
I think I'd like a glimpse of it
later this evening.

379
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,530
I can take a proper look in the
daylight with my wits about me.

380
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,970
You look as if you've spent the
winter away from these shores.

381
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,890
~ I've been in Alexandria.
~ Really? I don't envy you.

382
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,730
~ I'm not very good at abroad.
~ she's in the kitchen?

383
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,450
I don't know what room she's in. She
was giving a lesson to Daisy and
she's still here.

384
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,610
Shouldn't we invite her to dinner?
As she's your friend.

385
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,130
I don't think Lord Grantham would
like it. Not after last time.

386
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,780
But it seems terribly grand and
unfriendly not to. I'll ask Cora.

387
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,690
How are you? I haven't seen you for
ages.

388
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,770
Have I neglected you? I'm sorry.

389
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:57,090
No need to apologise. Although I
think you might perhaps have told me
I was not the lucky winner.

390
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,330
~ Why would you say that?
~ Because it's perfectly obvious.

391
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,850
Well, I don't seem to have broken
your heart.

392
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,900
You sound disappointed.

393
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,610
Who is this fellow, anyway.

394
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,650
Simon Bricker? Just a chap I know.

395
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,010
He was talking about his book in
Boodle's.

396
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,260
~ I mentioned the painting here and
that was it. ~ He's very brown.
Lucky chap.

397
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,730
Charles, I'm sorry if I've hurt you.

398
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,850
It's just only lately that I've
started to come out of the mist.

399
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,290
And the mist is clearing around the
lithe and supple figure of Tony
Gillingham.

400
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,610
~ Maybe. ~ Well... Good luck to you both.

401
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,650
I mean it.

402
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,420
That's why I came here. So I could
wish you luck in person.

403
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,450
~ We should give her the option.
~ If you're certain.

404
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,290
~ I don't want to feel I'm imposing.
~ Don't be silly. This is your home.

405
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,050
~ Where's Tom going?
~ Miss Bunting is downstairs.

406
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,290
~ What? ~ She's been teaching one of the
maids in the kitchen.

407
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,850
~ Tom's gone to ask if she'd like some
dinner. ~ You're not serious.

408
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,770
She's the first friend Tom's made
that has nothing to do with us and
we must respect that.

409
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,690
So every time we entertain we must
invite this tinpot Rosa Luxemburg.

410
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,730
Who's she?

411
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,850
A German communist who was shot and
thrown in the canal.

412
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,020
We wouldn't wish that on Miss
Bunting.

413
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,970
I didn't see the time. I've left
Mrs Patmore cooking for everyone.

414
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,220
Tell her from me, you'll prove a
talented mathematician.

415
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,410
Whose idea was it to ask me? Yours?

416
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,650
No, it was Rose. Although it's a new
sensation for me not to be alone in
my opinions at the table.

417
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,690
If I've encouraged you to stand your
ground, I'm glad.

418
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,010
But I don't feel like putting either
myself or Lord Grantham through
another test of strength.

419
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,460
Please thank them and say good night
for me.

420
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,130
I don't need a car. I'm perfectly
happy to walk.

421
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,170
When in Rome.

422
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,330
But do you ever think you might have
been in Rome too long?

423
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,210
~ Why do you say that? ~ You needn't
always do what the Romans do.

424
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,540
~ There's more in you than that.
~ I wonder.

425
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,380
You could do anything you want if
you put your mind to it.

426
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,130
I can't deny it. It's good to hear
you talk as if I had a real future.

427
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,170
You do have a future. But not here.

428
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,210
Not with these people.

429
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,050
Your link to them is Cybil but from
the way you talk I think she was
unique in this family.

430
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,810
~ Free of prejudice, free from narrow
thinking. ~ That's true enough.

431
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,690
~ She was unique. ~ I just want you to
remember that you are the man

432
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,850
who tempted her over the park wall
to run away to freedom.

433
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,890
I was that man.

434
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,050
But I'm not sure I can be that man
again.

435
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,770
You can be. I know it.

436
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,820
Good night.

437
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:56,330
Where's your friend?

438
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,490
She couldn't stay. She had to get
home.

439
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
What a relief.

440
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,890
What were you doing in Alexandria?

441
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Escaping the winter and looking at
beautiful things.

442
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,730
Beautiful and very ancient things.

443
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,570
~ I don't agree. ~ So you're
collecting clothes for
the Russian refugees.

444
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,930
I said no at first because, well, it
didn't feel terribly me.

445
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,650
But then I thought about them
leading their lives before the fall.

446
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,010
~ Doing everything you would do.
~ Exactly.

447
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,650
Dancing and shopping and seeing
their friends and then suddenly

448
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,650
being thrown out to fend for
themselves in the jungle.

449
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,810
Well, I thought I had to help if I
could.

450
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,650
It's lucky Miss Bunting refused our
invitation or she'd give tell us

451
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,210
how they're aristocrats and they
deserve it.

452
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,450
She believes the old regime was
unjust.

453
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,210
She hopes the new system will be an
improvement. Does that make her a
firebrand? Because I agree with her.

454
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,780
And you don't think certain acts
of savagery forfeit sympathy
for the perpetrators?

455
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,970
It was terrible, of course. But the
English killed King Charles the
first

456
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,090
to create a balance between the
throne and parliament.

457
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,810
~ I didn't kill him personally. ~ I
didn't shoot the Imperial Family.

458
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,170
Goodness. Is this what they call a
lively exchange of views?

459
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,940
It's about now that Papa usually
fetches his gun.

460
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,890
Mary, don't tease Mr Bricker.
He's come to see a painting

461
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,450
and finds himself in the middle of a
civil war.

462
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,490
I don't think we'll split tonight.

463
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,410
~ They'll only fight if we do.
~ You want to see the picture and
delay is torment.

464
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
You read my mind.

465
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,850
Carson, how are we to move forward
with the memorial?

466
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,170
I suppose your position has not
changed.

467
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,490
I can see that I'm losing. I would
rather be convinced than defeated,
my lord.

468
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,530
And I am not yet convinced.

469
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,570
Cousin Robert?

470
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,610
Did you see that the King is going
to speak on the wireless?

471
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,810
~ It was in the paper today.
~ Don't be silly.

472
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,450
No, it's true. For the opening of
the British Empire Exhibition.

473
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,290
It's being broadcast on the 23rd.
I just thought you'd like to know.

474
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,810
~ Is this true, Carson?
~ I believe so, my lord.

475
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,130
Talking about the Empire too.
I wonder.

476
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,690
If the King wants to use the wireless
to speak to his people maybe we have
to listen.

477
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,730
I wouldn't say that, my lord.

478
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,250
Is it not a case of the King being
forced into accepting a humiliating
assignment by his ministers?

479
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,890
~ Are you saying the King is a weak
man, Carson? ~ Never that, my lord.

480
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,530
But even kings must bow to pressure
sometimes.

481
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,130
And should we not support him in his
hour of endurance?

482
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,850
Oh, cheer up. We can always hire one.

483
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,380
Surely we won't be corrupted if it's
only in the house for a day.

484
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,660
They said you were out here.

485
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,660
I thought I'd get some air before we
have our dinner.

486
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,770
I've let you down, haven't I?

487
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,420
No, I wouldn't say so.

488
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,090
You are who you are.

489
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,810
You made choices and you paid the
price for them.

490
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,570
Still, I'm not who you thought me.

491
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,370
It is not for me to pass sentence.

492
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,770
You've had enough of that.

493
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,810
I've changed.

494
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,690
I'm different now. I wish you could
believe me.

495
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,730
But you won't tell me why you did it

496
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,410
because I am not persuaded you could
have acted on your own.

497
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,490
Maybe not. But I don't want to talk
about that.

498
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,580
Because, alone or not, in the end,
I made the choice to steal.

499
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,810
And there's no point trying to pass
the sin along.

500
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,850
Then you won't allow me an opinion.

501
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,290
You see, you wouldn't have done it.
No matter who asked you to.

502
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
No matter what the provocation.

503
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,890
I don't claim that. If a man must
watch his loved ones starve,

504
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,930
who's to say what he'll do?

505
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,970
But I wasn't starving, was I?

506
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
Believe me.

507
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,060
I'd give a limb to rewrite that
whole chapter of my life.

508
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,740
But I can't, Mr Molesley.

509
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,020
Even for you.

510
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,340
I can't.

511
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,170
Do you have a clear record of how it
came to be here?

512
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,210
The second Earl was our collector.

513
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,730
He bought it when he was quite a
young man on his grand tour.

514
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,570
~ Which was when? ~ 1789. We've a letter
from his mother.

515
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:39,010
She's heard about the fall of the
Bastille and her son was going
through France.

516
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,050
She sent it by special messenger.

517
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,090
~ Mothers. ~ Some things never change.

518
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,140
Lots of things never change.

519
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,690
Tomorrow I can show you some other
pictures he brought back if you have
time.

520
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,050
I have all the time in the world.
I should enjoy it very much.

521
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,770
~ There's coffee in the drawing room.
~ Thank you.

522
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,810
We'll be right in.

523
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,860
Isis, come here, girl.

524
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,570
I can't believe it. When she
explained how it all worked,

525
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,370
~ I could see it at once. ~ Well, this
is our lady of the numbers.

526
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,290
If I'd had a teacher like her,
things might have turned out
different.

527
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,730
They've not turned out so badly,
have they?

528
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,490
I'm glad to see some smiles at the
end of a long day.

529
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,010
Daisy's singing the praises of Miss
Bunting and her teaching.

530
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,730
I should keep it to yourself. She's
not a favourite with Mr Carson.

531
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,490
~ Why, what's she done? ~ It's not what
she's done it's what he calls her
dangerous ideas.

532
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,050
Dangerous or not I'm sure they're
good ideas.

533
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,570
Careful, he'll think you've been
infected.

534
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,100
~ What's this? ~ Daisy's worried she's
been infected with a cold from the
delivery boy.

535
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,340
Oh, his lordship and I are walking
down to the village tomorrow to look
at possible sites.

536
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,900
Erm, I don't like it when we're not
on the same side.

537
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,290
We're different people, Mr Carson.
We can't always agree.

538
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,330
I know.

539
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,380
But I don't like it.

540
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,610
I can't make a decision, Baxter,
until you tell me the whole truth.

541
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,650
I have, my lady.

542
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,180
I don't mean you tried to shield
yourself, quite the contrary.

543
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,530
To be honest, I don't know why I
haven't dismissed you out of hand.

544
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,370
I employ a jewel thief to look after
my jewels. It doesn't make sense!

545
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,930
~ I don't know what to say. ~ I should
sack you for just concealing it.

546
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,490
Should I take this as my dismissal?

547
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,500
I don't know. I don't know why not
but I don't know.

548
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,170
What was the matter with Tom?

549
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:54,130
Papa will blame his friend Miss
Bunting for filling his ears with
poison but I'm not sure.

550
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:57,890
~ He has so little life away from us.
~ He's had no life since Cybil died.

551
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,730
But I've a feeling he's turning back
into who he really is.

552
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,580
~ Is that a bad thing?
~ For us, maybe. But not for him.

553
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,500
Well, I'm going up.
Good night, you two.

554
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,330
Do you think there's a chance
cousin Robert might get a wireless?

555
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,770
Well, if he won't get one for the
King, your cause is hopeless.

556
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,820
That's true.

557
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,730
I loved Rose's definition of
ordinary life.

558
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,460
Dancing and shopping and seeing one's
friends.

559
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,050
I'm going to bed too.

560
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm worn out.

561
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,460
But I hope you'll be happy for me.
If it is Tony in the end.

562
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,330
Nothing will make me happier than
seeing you happy.

563
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,650
But please be absolutely sure before
you decide.

564
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,810
~ Why do you say that?
~ Because you're cleverer than he is.

565
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,170
That might have worked in the last
century

566
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,130
when ladies had to hide their brains
behind good manners and breeding.

567
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,690
~ But not now. ~ I don't agree. I think
Tony is quite as clever as I am.

568
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,130
Then one of us is right...
and one is wrong.

569
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:10,370
I'm not some overheated housemaid
drooling over a photograph of
Douglas Fairbanks.

570
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,130
Plantagenets are as susceptible as
housemaids when it comes to sex.

571
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,890
Are we talking about sex or love?

572
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,650
That is a question mankind has
wrestled with since the dawn of time.

573
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Good night.

574
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,130
Poor Tom. He's nothing more than a
ventriloquist dummy

575
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,770
for that terrible woman's ideas to
come spewing out of his mouth.

576
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,290
Maybe she's given him confidence to
say what he really thinks.

577
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:41,330
Not to sit in silence listening to a
thousands things he disagrees with.

578
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:45,300
She'll steal him away from us. She's
pulling him back to the other side.

579
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,730
I hope not. But if he feels he has
to go, that's what he must do.

580
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,370
~ Well, he's not taking Sybbie.
~ Don't be silly.

581
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,090
I mean it. I am not having Cybil's
only child

582
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,130
snatched from everyone she loves

583
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,810
to be brought up by some harpie in
an American sewer!

584
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,050
If the time comes, then we will talk
to Tom.

585
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,970
And I suggest we try to be a little
more calm about it.

586
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,490
For heaven's sake! Can't I be angry
when our eldest grandchild

587
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,180
is about to be stolen from us for
ever?

588
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,250
And tell your friend Bricker to stop
flirting with Isis.

589
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,410
There is nothing more ill-bred than
trying to steal the affections of
someone's else's dog!

590
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,450
Very well. I'll tell him.

591
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
To stop flirting.

592
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,610
I think I've put everything in.

593
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,930
~ Your packet's here, my lady.
~ Thank you.

594
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,090
I don't think there's anything too
difficult to fasten.

595
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Lord Gillingham can always help.

596
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,770
Are you certain you know what you're
doing?

597
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
I believe so.

598
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,050
Anna, the way things are going,

599
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,010
life will be lived in much closer
quarters in future.

600
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,770
My grandparents lived in vast rooms
surrounded by staff.

601
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,500
If they disagreed, they'd hardly have
known it.

602
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
But it won't be like that for us.

603
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,370
I must be sure I'm right to want this
man.

604
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,420
As my friend...

605
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,850
..as my lover...

606
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,890
as my husband.

607
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,940
Well, I think it's a big risk.

608
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,490
Please. I can't be lectured twice in
one evening.

609
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,010
I've already had a ticking off from
Mr Blake.

610
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,860
~ You didn't tell him. ~ Only that I
thought Lord Gillingham was the one.

611
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,010
The point is I want to marry again.

612
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,020
And I absolutely don't want to
divorce.

613
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,780
Well, I wish you luck, my lady.

614
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
~ Morning.
~ Morning.

615
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,650
There you are. I'm afraid it's the
perfect position for me.

616
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,130
Millions of men killed, my lord,
and we'll remember them

617
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:07,450
with a stone cross for women to stop
by and gossip?

618
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,370
I prefer to say that as people go
about their business, we remind them
of the men who died.

619
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,090
They gave their lives for our
freedom and we'll remember them with

620
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,100
a convenient step to sit for a
moment and tie up your shoelace.

621
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,530
~ Afternoon, my lord. ~ Hello,
Mrs Elkith. What are you up to?

622
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,570
I'm just waiting for our Robbie.

623
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,890
He likes to say hello to his father
sometimes after school.

624
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,250
It's good of you to make a special
journey.

625
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,170
Oh, no. He comes with me when I'm on
the way to the shop

626
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,530
or the post office and takes a
chance to visit the grave then.

627
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,090
My Bob was a lovely man and a
wonderful dad and I don't want our
Robbie to forget him.

628
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,690
Not if I can help it.

629
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,050
No. No, of course you don't.

630
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,970
Thank you, Mrs Elkith. Your words
have made quite an impression on me.

631
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,010
Don't you agree, Carson?

632
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,380
I do, yes. Quite an impression.

633
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
My lord.

634
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,650
Why is it called a wireless when
there's so many wires?

635
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
I don't know.

636
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,610
Nothing's happening.

637
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,660
It's just warming up, my lady.

638
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,900
Is that Jack Hylton?!

639
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Oh, golly, isn't this thrilling?!

640
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,810
What's this I see?

641
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:50,570
Servants loitering in the hall with
her ladyship due at any moment.

642
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,930
Look at that. If I touch it,
will I get a shock?

643
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,890
You'll only get a shock if you
listen to it.

644
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,930
I think it's exciting.
We're catching up, Mr Carson.

645
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,170
Whether you like it or not, Downton
is catching up with the times we
lived in.

646
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,940
That is exactly what I am afraid of.

647
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,700
Hello.

648
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,010
Before I go, I hope we're all united
in the plan.

649
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,380
~ It's very kind of you, my lady.
Isn't it, Margie? ~ Very kind.

650
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,850
I just want every opportunity for
little Marigold.

651
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,420
~ It's very generous. ~ And you won't
mind me being part of her life?

652
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,890
~ She needs a chance to dream. ~ You
mustn't fill her head with too many
dreams, my lady.

653
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,330
This is a wonderful opportunity
you're offering. Thank you.

654
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,380
I'll see you soon.

655
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,060
~ Bye-bye.
~ Bye.

656
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,490
~ What's the matter?
~ Why should anything be the matter?

657
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,530
You could have been more gracious.

658
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,090
I don't want this place to be her
doll's house.

659
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,650
And Marigold her doll. To be kissed
and petted

660
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,890
and cast aside when she loses
interest.

661
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,010
~ She won't lose interest.
~ How can you be sure? ~ I am sure.

662
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:25,690
I'll be in the yard. Tell me when
the food's ready.

663
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,730
Hands, please.

664
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,970
"It gives me the greatest pleasure
and satisfaction

665
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:36,690
to come here today with the Queen

666
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,530
for the purpose of opening the
British Empire Exhibition."

667
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,010
~ I suppose he can't hear us.
~ No, it doesn't work like that.

668
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,220
..the board of management."

669
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,940
Miss Mary Crawley.

670
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,610
Welcome to Liverpool, Miss Crawley.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

671
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,660
I'm sure I will.

672
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,650
Well, you have heard the voice of
His Majesty King George V.

673
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,210
What do you think, Carson? Mrs
Hughes, the King on the wireless?

674
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,770
I prefer to think of him on his
throne, my lord.

675
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,810
To me it's a good thing. To make him
less of a myth, more of a man.

676
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,980
Well, I hope you've all taken
something of value from it.

677
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:54,650
Mrs Hughes is right. The radio
somehow makes the King more real.

678
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,930
The monarchy has thrived on magic
and mystery.

679
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,330
Strip them away and people may think
the royal family is just like us.

680
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,370
Well, would that be so wrong?

681
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,540
Well, only if they want to stay at
Buckingham Palace.

682
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,860
It was as though he was right in the
room with us.

683
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,530
Cheer up, Mr Barrow.

684
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,660
Weren't you pleased to hear the King?

685
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,810
I expect it's difficult for you with
Jimmy gone.

686
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,370
We all need a special friend from
time to time.

687
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,690
I wasn't special to him. Not truly.

688
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,490
I don't agree. I think he liked you.

689
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,290
Maybe. A little.

690
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,130
But I don't think I'm very likeable
to people here.

691
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,170
Do you want to be?

692
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,420
There are times when I'd like to
belong?

693
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860
Does that sound funny?

694
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
Not to me. Not at all.

695
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,010
Shall I have it collected in the
morning, my lord?

696
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,770
~ Must he? ~ Do we need to get rid of it
in quite such a hurry now it's here.

697
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,290
~ Put it in the small library.
~ Thank you for changing your mind.

698
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,450
I wasn't aware I'd decided against
it.

699
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,490
You can clear this for now.

700
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,020
It's such a pity Mary had to miss it
for a boring sketching trip.

701
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,450
It's mad not to give a false name.

702
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,820
Always make a lie as truthful as
possible.

703
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,330
If you're seen, you have the right
name, you're alone in your room.

704
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,500
And why shouldn't you be in
Liverpool?

705
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,250
How did you manage to get the rooms
connected?

706
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,300
Well, I'm not a complete halfwit.

707
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
Nor, happily, is the manager.

708
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,530
So, what's the plan?

709
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,690
It's a simple one. We'll go down to
Church Street for a delicious
dinner.

710
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,130
After which, we'll come back.

711
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,170
And...make love?

712
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,210
Exactly.

713
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,250
We'll make love all night.

714
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,620
And, in fact, for as long as either
of us has any stamina left.

715
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
And who can say fairer than that?

716
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,330
I meant to ask how you got on this
morning.

717
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,370
Oh, we've settled it.

718
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,420
It's going to be in the village.

719
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,770
Well, I hope you're not too upset.

720
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:47,810
I only asked to be convinced.

721
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,330
My walk through the village
convinced me.

722
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,690
~ And...there's a bonus.
~ What's that?

723
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:57,530
It puts us back in agreement,
Mrs Hughes.

724
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,660
I'm not comfortable when you and I
are not in agreement.

725
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,370
You're very flattering.

726
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,300
With talk like that you make me want
to check to see that my hair's tidy.

727
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,930
~ Get away with you.
~ No, I mean it.

728
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,410
~ There's a policeman to see you,
Mr Carson. ~ A policeman?

729
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,650
It's just Sergeant Willis,
Mr Carson.

730
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,690
Hello, Mr Willis.

731
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,930
Thank you, Mr Barrow. You're
scaremongering has not succeeded.

732
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,610
That'll be all. Sit down, Mr Willis.

733
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,650
Have a cup of tea.

734
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,210
~ How can I help you?
~ Well, it's an odd business but we
may as well get down to it.

735
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,490
A man stayed here last year, Mr Alex
Green. Worked for Lord Gillingham.

736
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:46,050
I remember him well. Why wouldn't I
when he died so very tragically not
long after?

737
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,810
Well, that's all I need. I've just
been told to check that you remember
him. Thank you.

738
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,170
And to give warning that we might
need to ask some questions.

739
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,210
I don't understand.

740
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,250
Well, something's turned up.

741
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,770
And before they take it further,
they're trying to establish its
significance.

742
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,820
But what is that? What's turned up?

743
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,500
A witness.

744
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,610
~ What would it be like to go somewhere
no-one knows us? ~ Why do you say that?

745
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,250
If a man seduced me, I would not let
any grass grow under his feet.

746
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,900
~ I want you to tell me the missing
element of your story? ~ If I don't?

747
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,690
She can't have our child and that's
flat!

748
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,370
Allow me to present Prince Kuragin.

749
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,820
Goodness! Granny has a past.

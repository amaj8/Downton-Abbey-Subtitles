1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,320
~ Cora.
~ Hello, Rosamund.

2
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
You made good time.

3
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,200
~ I say!
~ What?

4
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
Some man has opened a nudist colony
at Wickford in Essex,

5
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,640
called the Moonella Group.

6
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,280
What do you mean,
a man has opened a colony in Essex?

7
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,240
Not that sort of colony, Mama.

8
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,800
It's for people who want
to take all their clothes off.

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,040
In Essex? Isn't it terribly damp?

10
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,680
~ Would that make a difference?
~ Well, yes, if you had no clothes on.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
Well, I think it's a mad idea.

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Oh, I doubt
they were aiming it at you.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,640
I wanted to come after Mary told me
about the farmer's child

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,760
you're taking such an interest in.

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,040
Come to my room when you're changed.

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,360
~ How long are you here for?
~ About a week, if I'm allowed.

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,480
Good. We're giving a bash
for my Deputy Lieutenants on Friday.

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,960
You can stay and help.

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm afraid I'll be away
on Thursday night.

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,800
It's another of my Lord Loot things.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,960
I'm guest of honour at a dinner
for all the Yorkshire-based
commanding officers.

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
~ You're staying the night?
~ It's in Sheffield,

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,960
and it'll be very late,
so it seems sensible.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,920
You'll just have to make do
with Cora.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And Edith and Tom and Rose.

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
What news of your suitor?

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,480
I haven't heard from him lately.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,040
Have you decided what answer
you're going to give him yet?

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,440
Well, I think I should tell him
before I tell you.
Wouldn't you agree?

30
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,680
Ellen Terry has nothing on you when
it comes to stringing out a moment.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,680
~ Oh, are you busy?
~ No, no, no. Come in.

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,640
How can I help?

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
Would you like me to leave?

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Oh, I'd love to think I had a secret
that was too indelicate
for a lady's ear, but I haven't.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,080
No, I've got some good news,
for a change.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,320
An old aunt's died.

37
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,440
No, that's not the good news,
but she made old bones.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,760
~ Which is the main thing.
~ Well, the point is,

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
she's left me a bit of money.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,640
~ Ah. ~ It's a few hundred quid,
more than I've ever saved.

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,320
I am glad for you.

42
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,080
Well, she was married to a baker
and he did well,
but they had no children.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,800
How nice of her to choose you.

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,680
Well, I think it was in memory
of my dad, more than anything.

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
She and he were very close -

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,280
And you want my advice on what to do
with the inheritance? Is that it?

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
It is.

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,160
You'd do better asking Mr Branson's
advice. Or Dr Clarkson's.

49
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
She's asking mine.

50
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,840
But we live so out of the way here.

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,280
You need to talk to someone
who's still in the game.

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
I'll give it some thought,
Mrs Patmore.

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,480
And now, if you'll allow me,
I will go up and ring the gong.

54
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,720
Come and sit here and we can talk.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,760
I'm not going to eat you.

56
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,440
But you are going to chew me up.

57
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,800
Why not just tell me about
the dear little farmer's daughter?

58
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,560
~ What did Mary say?
~ No more than that.

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,800
You knew I'd bring her back.

60
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,760
I feared it.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
And I still feel very sorry
for poor Mrs Schroder.

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,520
I wrote to her. She told me
she's adopted another baby.

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,920
Then she has solved her problem,

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,040
but the question remains:
have you solved yours?

65
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,400
Am I at least going to be allowed
to see the girl?

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,760
~ Do you want to?
~ Of course.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
I gave up ten months of my life
to make sure she came safely
into the world.

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,000
The trouble is, the farmer's wife,
Mrs Drewe,

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,680
she just thinks I'm a nuisance.

70
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,600
She doesn't want me to see Marigold.

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,160
So, we have a situation of infinite
danger to your reputation,

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,200
which brings you no emotional reward
to compensate.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,040
~ Are we the first down?
~ It looks like it. Want some?

74
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
Mmm.

75
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,560
How is Miss Bunting?
Still teaching Daisy downstairs?

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,120
She is. But don't worry.

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
I won't ask her to join us
in the future.

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Cora would overrule me in a moment
if she thought it important to you.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,360
Which you don't think it should be?

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,040
I know you feel excluded at times,
an outsider in your own home.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,640
Look, I am very grateful to you
and this family.

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,120
But my vision of this country
is different from yours.

83
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,800
But not from Miss Bunting's?

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
I believe in reform
and the moral direction of the Left,

85
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,160
and when I'm with her,
I don't feel like a freak or a fool,

86
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,280
devoid of common sense.

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,040
I would only say this, Tom:

88
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,880
In your time here you've learned
both sides of the argument,

89
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,160
befriended people
you'd once have seen as enemies.

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
~ That's true.
~ You should be proud.

91
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,200
Five years ago,
would you have believed
you could be friendly with my mother?

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm not sure I'd have
believed it five minutes ago.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,800
Don't make nothing
of what you've achieved. That's all.

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,480
Drinks before dinner?
Wait till Carson catches you.

95
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,000
You'll notice I poured them myself.

96
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,360
Anna, I've had a note
from Sergeant Willis.

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,080
He says he's going to look in
this morning at 11 o'clock.

98
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,040
~ To see me?
~ That's what he says.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,360
~ Anyone else, Mr Carson?
~ I'm not sure.

100
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,880
He says he wants to talk
to Anna and Lady Mary.

101
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,200
Lady Mary? Why her?

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,120
I don't know.
But could you warn her?

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll tell her
when I take up the breakfast tray.

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,680
May I ask... to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

105
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I'll get straight down to it.

106
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,920
You know how Lord Merton likes to...

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,480
display his interest
in all things medical?

108
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,600
At least, he likes to,
when in the company of Mrs Crawley.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,400
Your confidence is a compliment.

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,360
I confide in you, Dr Clarkson,
because I must.

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Only you can help.

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,680
~ That is more flattering still.
~ It's the family's fault, really.

113
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,920
We've trained her in our ways,
and the earnest and intellectual
'bonne bourgeoise'

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,480
has been replaced by...
a rather less definable figure.

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,080
Are you saying you liked her better
when she was more middle-class?

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,360
~ No, I wouldn't go that far.
~ But you understood her better.

117
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,520
Precisely.
Now I do not know who she is.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
I do not know what it is she wants.

119
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,160
Well, there are many who wouldn't
be puzzled by the desire

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,200
to marry a lord
and live in a palace.

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,080
Can I ask you a personal question?

122
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,440
I've lived through great wars
and my share of grief.

123
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,360
I think I can manage an impertinent
question from a doctor.

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,800
Do you perhaps resent the idea of a
change of position for Mrs Crawley?

125
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,120
I'm sorry.
I do not quite grasp your question.

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
It bewilders me.

127
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
But I will say this:

128
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,680
Do you wish to see her live a life

129
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,080
devoid of industry and moral worth?

130
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,840
~ I do not.
~ And when the glitter is tarnished,

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
you know, what then?

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,440
A hollow existence
in a large and draughty house,

133
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,480
with a man who bores her to death.

134
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,640
~ It's a terrible prospect.
~ So our duty is clear.

135
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Oh... It's you, m'lady.

136
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,080
Yes. I wanted to bring my aunt
to meet Marigold.

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,960
This is Lady Rosamund Painswick.
May I introduce Mrs Drewe?

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,480
How do you do, Mrs Drewe?
We're sorry for dropping in like
this. I expect you're very busy.

139
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,160
I am busy, m'lady, yes.

140
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,440
This is Marigold.

141
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,920
Oh, I do see. She's very sweet.

142
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Lady Edith seems to think so.

143
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,840
Hello.

144
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,160
Lady Edith has decided to show off
the baby to her aunt.

145
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,120
~ Lady Rosamund Painswick.
~ Pleased to meet you, m'lady.

146
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,040
Well, we don't want
to disturb your day.

147
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,320
I've got to get the dinner started.

148
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Yes, of course.

149
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,320
Goodbye, dear.

150
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Remember your...
Remember your friend, Rosamund.

151
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,400
I should take her inside.

152
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
~ Oh, I could always -
~ I'll take her.

153
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Of course.

154
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Goodbye.

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
Well?

156
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,840
It's exactly
what I said would happen.

157
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,600
She wants Marigold as her toy,

158
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
to be poked and prodded by every
stray guest from the big house!

159
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,840
And you've done this.
You've done it!

160
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,240
What did you mean
by saying to Mrs Patmore

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,840
we were living our lives
out of the way, not in the game?

162
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,280
Well, we are.

163
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,280
Why does everyone talk as if
we don't live in the modern world?

164
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,960
~ You don't agree with that, then?
~ No.

165
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Does the King not live in the world
of today?

166
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,680
Does Mr Sargent not paint
modern pictures?

167
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,840
Does Mr Kipling not write
modern books?

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,840
~ So, what are you going to tell her?
~ I don't know yet. I shall consider.

169
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,480
Sergeant Willis is asking for you,
Mr Carson.

170
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,520
He's got a man with him
from London, he says.

171
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,920
~ They're in the library now.
~ They?

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,760
An Inspector's come
from Scotland Yard.

173
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,200
What does he want with me?

174
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,560
What does he want with any of us?
None of it makes any sense.

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,080
By the way, I'd like to catch
the ten-o'clock train tomorrow.

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm dining with Mr Blake
and I don't want to be in a rush.

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
Will we stay at Lady Rosamund's?

178
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,560
She doesn't mind. She's told Mead.

179
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,400
~ Will you see Lord Gillingham?
~ I don't think so.

180
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
So you haven't changed your mind?

181
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,520
Right. Let's get this over with.

182
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,760
Have I finished us off
before we ever really got started?

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,480
You've pitted yourself against them
from the start.

184
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,440
How can you retreat
from that position?

185
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,600
You mean I've made it 'them or me'?

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,000
Haven't you?

187
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,760
You despise the family, but I think
you forget my wife was one of them.

188
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
My child IS one of them.

189
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Where does that leave me?

190
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't you despise them? Really?

191
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
No, I don't.

192
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,560
I'd like things to change,
but I don't think
in black-and-white terms any more.

193
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,800
~ While I do?
~ Look, I'm not going to pretend

194
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,160
I haven't enjoyed knowing you.

195
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,360
In fact, I'm relieved to know
I'm not the only Socialist
left on this earth.

196
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,880
But maybe we should call it a day,
before one of us gets hurt.

197
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't know what else to add,
Mr Vyner.

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,200
I remember we had to race
to catch the train.

199
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,280
I'd had lunch with Lord Gillingham
and I needed to get home,

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,960
as the church fete was planned
for the following day.

201
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,760
And it was during the fete
that Lord Gillingham arrived

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,560
with the news of Mr Green's death?

203
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,640
That's right. And I told Anna.

204
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,040
Hmm.

205
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,600
Was it a great surprise?

206
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,000
I think I would have
called it a shock.

207
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,720
She was very shocked.

208
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,640
Was she? Was she, indeed?

209
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
~ Can I go now? ~ I think Lady Mary
has given what help she can.

210
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,240
Erm... will you confirm
that Mrs Bates was in London

211
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,480
on the morning that Mr Green died
and that you don't know where?

212
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,600
I only have to ask her.

213
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Secondly,
you have no reason to believe

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,680
that Bates was anywhere
further south than York?

215
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
No reason at all.

216
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,640
I think they'd enjoy
getting to know each other better.

217
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,040
I think it's a nice idea,
but shouldn't I do it, for once?

218
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,240
I always seem to be taking luncheon
off you.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,920
No, I'd rather.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,960
You see, Mrs Potter likes
to have people to cook for.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,320
And Spratt needs something
to occupy his mind.

222
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh?

223
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,280
We both have an inkling that my maid
Collins is on the way out.

224
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,920
~ Oh, I do hope not.
~ No, I don't mean she's dying.

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
I mean she's on her way
out of my house.

226
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,080
She keeps talking
about her mother being infirm.

227
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,640
But I'm infirm.
Why doesn't she think about that?

228
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
You're as infirm as Windsor Castle.

229
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,600
And why does Spratt mind,
particularly?

230
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,840
Because he likes things
to be just so.

231
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,280
But also,
I think Collins was his creature

232
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,960
and does his bidding
without qualm or query.

233
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,200
He can't be sure of that
in the next one.

234
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,640
Well, never having had
a lady's maid, it's not a challenge
I've had to tussle with.

235
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,680
~ But you'll come on Thursday?
~ I will.

236
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
I think it would be nice
for Doctor Clarkson

237
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,240
to see beyond Lord Merton's
position and get to know the man.

238
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,040
I agree.

239
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Oh!
I knew I had something to tell you.

240
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,920
Shrimpie thinks he may be
on the trail of Princess Kuragin.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, I am pleased.

242
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,800
Yes, he's heard a rumour of some
Russian nurses working in...

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,000
Wan... Wan Chai?

244
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,920
~ And that's in Hong Kong?
~ Well, nearby, I think.

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
Well, it sounds much better
than it might have been.

246
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Yes. The idea of Princess Irina
scrubbing the sick

247
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,320
and emptying bedpans
is a cheering one.

248
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,880
~ Will you tell her husband? ~ No,
I'll wait until Shrimpie is certain.

249
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,400
These things
must be managed carefully.

250
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Yes.

251
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,880
Sounds as if this must be managed
very carefully.

252
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,440
Why did Mr Carson try to hide
that you were in London on that day?

253
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,240
I don't think he tried to hide
anything. He just forgot.

254
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,760
Isn't it a big thing when a member
of the staff goes to London?

255
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,440
~ Not for a lady's maid.
~ Mrs Hughes, please.

256
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,840
She's right. It's not a big thing
for ladies' maids or valets.

257
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm going tomorrow with Lady Mary.

258
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,680
And you liked Mr Green?

259
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,560
Yes. I did. Very much.

260
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,280
He wasn't so fond of your husband.

261
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,640
Well,
there's no accounting for taste.

262
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,280
Don't go away, Mrs Bates.

263
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,800
You've said you'll be in London.
I've no objection.

264
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
But don't go away.

265
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,080
I'm very sorry, My Lord.
I wonder if you know when we can
get in here and lay the table.

266
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,760
The police have taken over
the library, and I needed
to spread these out.

267
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,760
~ What are they for? ~ I'm trying to
formulate my plans for the village,

268
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,720
and I'm looking into some builders.

269
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,960
You won't use
the ordinary maintenance team?

270
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,600
It would be beyond them.

271
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,480
Have you made your choice?

272
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,040
I'll have to talk to Lady Mary,
but I like the look of this outfit.

273
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,960
They're based in Thirsk, so they're
local, and their work is excellent.

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,120
Of course,
we should all invest in building.

275
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,040
Fortunes will be made
over the next few years.

276
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,720
Why don't I hold the bags,
while you do that?

277
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,360
Oh, that's frightfully nice of you!
Are you sure?

278
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
Quite sure.

279
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
~ Erm... I can have them back now.
~ I shouldn't dream of it.

280
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,680
Where are you going?

281
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Erm... just to St Mary Magdalene's.

282
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,800
You must have a very sweet tooth!

283
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,440
No, they're not for me.

284
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,000
I give tea to some Russian refugees
every Tuesday and Thursday.
They love cake.

285
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,400
~ I love cake.
~ Oh, come and have some, if you like.

286
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
~ Are you interested in Russia?
~ Not terribly...

287
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
although I am very sorry
for them all.

288
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,280
Of course.

289
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,120
I should be more interested, really.

290
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,120
~ Why?
~ I have a bit of Russian blood.

291
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,800
~ How extraordinary!
~ It's true.

292
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,600
In a way, my family is Russian.
Or, at least, they used to be.

293
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,840
Well, now I insist.
Come and have some tea.

294
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,360
By way of a thank-you.

295
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,640
I suppose we ought to introduce
ourselves, even if it feels funny.

296
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,560
Erm... Rose MacClare.

297
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,320
Atticus Aldridge, at your service.

298
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,080
That doesn't sound very Russian.

299
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,320
Well, we weren't called Aldridge
back then.

300
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,160
Mrs Patmore, I think I may have
a solution to your problem.

301
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,600
Oh, that's good to hear.

302
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,160
Why not invest
in the building trade?

303
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,040
With the expansion
that's going on everywhere,
you'd soon see a good return.

304
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,360
Oh. Well, that's a thought.

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,520
Had you any special firm in mind?

306
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,040
What about WP Moss?

307
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,440
They're based in Thirsk,
they're expanding,
and I hear their name everywhere.

308
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I expect you keep your ear to
the ground about that sort of thing.

309
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,720
I like to keep abreast
of what's going on in the world.

310
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,360
So, can you buy shares in WP Moss?
I mean, have they gone public?

311
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,120
Well, erm...
you'll have to make enquiries.

312
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,800
Miss Bunting? I must confess
I am surprised to see you here.

313
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,320
Rest easy, Mr Carson.
I've come to say goodbye.

314
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,120
She's leaving the school, isn't she?

315
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,520
She's leaving the school
and the village, because Mr Branson
won't stand up to His Lordship.

316
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,920
You are nudging impertinence, Daisy.

317
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,640
I should think carefully
before you say one more word.

318
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,200
Are you going? Honestly?

319
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,360
I am, but the situation's
not quite as Daisy recounted it.

320
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,920
We already knew that.

321
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,520
I've had an offer, from a school
in Preston, in Lancashire.

322
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,880
A grammar school, no less,
so it's quite a step up.

323
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,160
I dithered a bit,
but I've decided to accept.

324
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,440
Because she gets insulted
when she comes here.

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,520
I am sure Miss Bunting is given
the reception she deserves.

326
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,640
Mrs Patmore...

327
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Don't let Daisy give up her studies.
She's got potential.

328
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,200
~ What's going on here?
~ All sorts.

329
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,160
Mr Carson's giving me
investment advice
and Miss Bunting's leaving Downton,

330
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,520
because Mr Branson
won't stick up for her.

331
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
Well, that seems to cover it.

332
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll be in my room.

333
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,280
Well, goodbye... and good luck.

334
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Goodbye.

335
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Ah, Mrs Hughes.
Who is this Mr Vyner?

336
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,320
He's the London detective,
looking into the death of Mr Green.

337
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,000
Why do they keep questioning
Mr and Mrs Bates?

338
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
Who says they do?

339
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,720
This house has no secrets.

340
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,440
Then I suggest you ask Mr Vyner.

341
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,480
I may just do that.

342
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,000
Who knows?
I might have something to tell him.

343
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,720
Don't make trouble, Mr Barrow.

344
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,520
Are you saying
I shouldn't do my duty, Mrs Hughes?

345
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,560
No.
I'm asking you not to make trouble.

346
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,080
Are you quite well? You look
as if you could do with a lie down.

347
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Don't worry about me.

348
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,880
~ Who was that on the telephone?
~ Simon Bricker.

349
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,840
Oh, God. What did he want?

350
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,160
I shall answer
without commenting on your tone.

351
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
He wants the picture photographed
for his book.

352
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,000
~ When is this? ~ He comes tomorrow and
they take the pictures on Friday.

353
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
Well, you know I won't be here.
I've got the dinner in Sheffield.

354
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
Since you don't like him,
I don't see that as a drawback.

355
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,760
~ And Mary's in London.
~ What difference does that make?

356
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,600
It's not that I dislike him, exactly.

357
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,880
It's that this business
has been dragging on.

358
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,280
Robert, it's a compliment.
By referencing our painting
in his book,

359
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,960
he'll increase its value,
maybe by a lot. Is that so bad?

360
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,960
You're not forbidden
from inviting him.

361
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,320
Good, because I already have.

362
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Mr Branson, sir.

363
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Hello, Daisy. What can I do for you?

364
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
You can do something for yourself.
You're making the biggest mistake
of your life.

365
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,640
~ Is this Miss Bunting, by any chance?
~ She's an extraordinary person.

366
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
Clever and kind.

367
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,760
~ She's all of those things.
~ Then why turn your back on her?

368
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,000
~ Daisy -
~ I mean it.

369
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,560
She's leaving tomorrow,
but I know she loves you.

370
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,200
I can tell when she speaks of you.

371
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,960
She's leaving tomorrow? For good?

372
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,520
Won't you stop her?
You're not a Crawley.

373
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,680
You belong with us.

374
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,720
We're the future. They're the past.

375
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
~ Well, I can hear her voice in that.
~ Daisy?

376
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,320
What are you doing here?

377
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,760
She was checking something
in the dining room. I held her up.

378
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,840
Get back downstairs immediately.

379
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,600
Mr Carson.

380
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,600
Have any of you heard of someone
called Atticus Aldridge?

381
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,440
He sounds like the hero of a novel
by Mrs Humphrey Ward.

382
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,080
~ I'm not sure. Any more clues?
~ I met him today. In York.

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,200
Marsha George told me his father's
been made Lord Sinderby.

384
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,160
Now, wait a minute. I remember this.

385
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,640
When the title was created,
the locals were furious,
but now I can't remember why.

386
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Perhaps because Sinderby's
a Yorkshire village
and they'd only just bought a house.

387
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,200
~ Canningford Grange.
~ Oh! Have the Wheelers sold up?

388
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,880
You knew that. I told you.
What does My Lord Sinderby do?

389
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
Oh, I think he's a banker.

390
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I don't know, really,
but the son's nice.

391
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,000
Oh... nothing like that!

392
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,800
Barrow, are you quite well?

393
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,080
Carson,
have you been over-working him?

394
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,320
Not that I'm aware, Your Ladyship.

395
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,720
Mr Barrow, am I ill-treating you?

396
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,760
~ You are the soul of kindness,
Mr Carson. ~ Thank you, Mr Barrow.

397
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
I'm looking forward to your party.

398
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,840
It's very daring of the Lord
Lieutenant to give a cocktail party.

399
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,200
Carson, what do you think?

400
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,320
Well, I agree with Carson.
It seems very fast to me.

401
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
~ Well, I love cocktail parties.
~ Me too.

402
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,200
You only have to stay 40 minutes,
instead of sitting
for seven courses,

403
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,160
between a deaf landowner
and an even deafer Major General.

404
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,520
Even so, they'll say you're not
doing things 'properly' any more.

405
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,840
~ Do you care what people think?
~ Yes.

406
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,720
I accept change,
but I want to navigate it gently.

407
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,520
I don't want to leap into it
and put everyone's backs up.

408
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,800
But why do the rituals, the clothes
and the customs, matter so much?

409
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,240
Because, without them, we would be
like the Wild Men of Borneo.

410
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,680
I disagree. Manners and tradition
are all very well,

411
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
but once they start to control us,
they've outlived their usefulness.

412
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,160
Well, there are more important
things to worry about

413
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,040
than whether or not Carson
minds serving cocktails.

414
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,160
Why is Carson in the line of fire?
What's he done wrong?

415
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Mama.
I've rather a headache.

416
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,680
~ What was that about? ~ Rosamund,
you spent the afternoon together.

417
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,800
Did Edith say
anything was bothering her?

418
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,280
Oh, she's just very tired.
She'll be fit as a flea tomorrow.

419
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,000
That's nice of you.
I'll just let Mr Carson know.

420
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,560
Oh, could you leave it,
for a moment?

421
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,960
He's given me his view,
about my money.

422
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,240
He says I should put it
into a building firm, WP Moss,

423
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,800
or, if not them, then into some
other building opportunity.

424
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,080
~ And you don't want to?
~ It's not that, exactly.

425
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,040
But I don't know about building,

426
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,080
and I don't like to put money
into something I don't understand.

427
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,000
~ Then why did you ask him?
~ Because he's a man, I suppose.

428
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,800
I'm not sure
that's a good enough reason.

429
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,720
Nor am I now.

430
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,200
But I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

431
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,800
I wish men worried about our feelings
a quarter as much
as we worry about theirs.

432
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
You seem very thoughtful.

433
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm on the brink of a decision.

434
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,800
I just hope it's the right one.

435
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,840
Well, I won't ask what it's about.

436
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,760
But remember, Tom - make the right
choice for you and not for us.

437
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
You know, you're much nicer
than a lot of people realise.

438
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,840
Not always. Good night.

439
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
Good night.

440
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,560
I don't know what you mean, Mama.

441
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,160
You question my motives
every time I come here.

442
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
It's as if I weren't welcome.

443
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,320
Just tell me: what were you and Edith
discussing in such a huddle?

444
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,880
Well, it is very hard -

445
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,160
Rosamund, you are addressing
your mother, not the committee
of the Women's Institute.

446
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,720
I'm afraid you've read somewhere
that rudeness in old age is amusing,

447
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,520
which is quite wrong, you know.

448
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,120
It's about the child, isn't it?
That is the secret you share.

449
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,120
We both know you are not leaving
my house until I learn the truth.

450
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,400
So, shall I have a bed
made up for you here,
or are you going to tell me now?

451
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,720
Mr Drewe... I have to see her.

452
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,920
It was a mistake
to bring your aunt here.

453
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,040
Margie feels that you want the child
to be your plaything.

454
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,120
How can she say that?

455
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,520
The fact is, I was wrong.

456
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,560
She won't have you here,
not any more.

457
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,200
You must leave us alone.

458
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,320
If you don't stop coming,
she'll make me give up the farm
and move away.

459
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,520
But what about Marigold?

460
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
What do you mean? We'd take her.

461
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
But you can't. I won't allow it.

462
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,320
What would you suggest?

463
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
We bring her up to the Abbey
and leave her in the library?

464
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,960
I'm very sorry, m'lady.
It's not what I planned.

465
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
But I see no way round it.

466
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,360
People always think how healthy we
must be, living out in the country,

467
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,640
but the water's not as good
as it might be.

468
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,480
~ You mean the iodine deficiency?
~ I do.

469
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,360
I suppose you must get
a lot of goitres.

470
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,400
Er... quite a lot, yes.

471
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,920
It's sad so few people know
that the treatment is just iodine.

472
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,120
Too many suffer
when the solution is simple.

473
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,960
~ You've studied this?
~ I've just read a lot.

474
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,760
I wish I had studied it.

475
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,480
Luncheon is served, m'lady.

476
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,080
Do cheer up, Spratt.

477
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,000
Spratt is downcast,
because it is as I feared.

478
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,840
Collins has handed in her notice.

479
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,200
~ You don't like change, Spratt?
~ I detest it, madam.

480
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,200
Well, we all hate change, Spratt,

481
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,360
but we have to learn to live with it.

482
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,840
I don't hate change.
I find it exciting.

483
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Remember - those customs
and ceremonies that people think
are the soul of England

484
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,160
were almost all invented
by the Victorians.

485
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,160
Quite right.

486
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,960
The truth is, they're well suited,
whether we like it or not.

487
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,960
And I don't believe he's faking
his interest in medicine.

488
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
I'm afraid I agree with you.

489
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,760
You must be off soon.

490
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,120
I'm just going to put him
in his uniform, and then we'll go.

491
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,480
You never told me
what the Inspector wanted yesterday.

492
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Mainly because I'm not sure.

493
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,920
He asked me if I liked Mr Green
and why he didn't like you.

494
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,520
And what did you say?

495
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,920
I said I don't know, because I don't.

496
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,240
I promise you this.

497
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,520
Nothing bad is ever going to happen
to you again.

498
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,560
~ I hope that's true.
~ We'll sit by the fire,

499
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,560
with all our children around us,

500
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,000
and I'll make certain
that you are safe.

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,400
I wonder.

502
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,640
We both want it so much, but do you
believe it'll really happen?

503
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,160
I do. With all my heart.

504
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,760
Actually, I'm not sure about having
children 'all around us'.

505
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,440
How many are you planning on,
Mr Bates?

506
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,200
~ You nearly missed me.
~ You never told me you were going.

507
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,560
~ Who did?
~ Daisy.

508
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,800
My champion.

509
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,400
~ The school must be sorry.
~ Maybe.

510
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:57,200
I think I was rather a nuisance,
but I hope they'll miss me a bit.

511
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,480
I hope you'll miss me a bit.

512
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
I'll miss you a lot.

513
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I've loved you, you know.

514
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,120
I could have loved you more
if you'd let me.

515
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,240
I'm glad we met.

516
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,040
You've reminded me of who I am,
and I'm grateful.

517
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,360
And I won't lose touch with that
again.

518
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,440
But I wish we'd met
before you ever knew them.

519
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,360
We need to get started, if you're
to catch the four o'clock, miss.

520
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,440
Let me.

521
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,560
~ Did you have a nice journey?
~ Excellent.

522
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank you very much.

523
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,320
Hello, Lord Grantham.
You look very splendid.

524
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,840
We're ships that pass in the night,
Mr Bricker.

525
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,480
I have to go to Sheffield,
but I'll see you tomorrow,

526
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,240
if you're still here when I get back.

527
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Goodbye, Cora.

528
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,200
So, here we are again.

529
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm beginning to find Downton
quite home-like.

530
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,520
Good. You're very welcome.

531
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
As long as you behave.

532
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,200
What are you doing here?

533
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,600
In search of more cake?

534
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,160
I wanted to see you again,
before I went up to London
to start my new job at the bank.

535
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,600
Do you think I should buy
a bowler hat?

536
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,160
Let me introduce you.
Prince Kuragin, Count Rostov,
this is Mr Aldridge.

537
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,400
I'm Mr Kuragin here.

538
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,480
~ Have you heard from Aunt Violet yet?
~ Even if your father finds her,

539
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,920
what happens next? To any of us.

540
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,080
We are strangers in a strange land.

541
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,640
Talk to Mr Aldridge.

542
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,440
His family were Russian,

543
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,080
but they've started a new life
in England, and so can you.

544
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,840
Where did they come from?

545
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Odessa.

546
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,480
His great-grandfather
came with some of them in 1859.

547
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,640
See? I do remember what I'm told.

548
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,240
~ And then the rest of the family
followed in - ~ 1871.

549
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,680
How brilliant! That's right.

550
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,520
~ He is not Russian.
~ Nikolai. Nye nado.

551
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,920
No, he's not Russian now, but -

552
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,160
They were not Russian then!

553
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,080
I'm sorry about that.

554
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,000
Nikolai, podozhdi!

555
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,360
I don't understand.

556
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,800
Erm...
I think he said we're not Russian,

557
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,920
because we're... we're Jewish.

558
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Well, how did he know?

559
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,240
There were two big pogroms
to drive out the Jews from Odessa,
one in 1859...

560
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
And 1871?

561
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,600
But it's still odd.

562
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,520
I mean, you're English now,
but you're still Jewish.

563
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
What's the difference?

564
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,120
Would you let me give you dinner
when you're in London?

565
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,000
I might.

566
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
We'll have to see.

567
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,080
What a treat. I haven't been
to Simpson's for ages.

568
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,760
We'll go straight to the table.

569
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,480
I've asked a friend to join us,
and I want you to behave.

570
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Why wouldn't I?

571
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,080
Goodness. I wasn't expecting you.

572
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,840
~ Ditto.
~ I, happily, was expecting you both.

573
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,520
What is your scheme?
That we now hold hands and take
a house by the sea together?

574
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,800
Not quite.
But I have an idea that may be,

575
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,640
as The Times advertisements say,
'to your mutual advantage'.

576
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,320
You've got to stop this.
You're poisoning yourself.

577
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,280
Just lay off.

578
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Look at you. Sweating like a beast.

579
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,840
Just because Her Ladyship
let you stay, you think
you can boss us all around.

580
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,040
Forgot the cream.

581
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,760
Oh, Miss Baxter, you may not think
I have the right to ask,

582
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,280
but now that Her Ladyship knows
the truth, might you tell me?

583
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,880
If you really want me to.

584
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,880
~ Mr Molesley! Now.
~ Yes, Mr Carson. Right away.

585
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,400
I don't think
I can be hearing this correctly.

586
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,000
~ No?
~ No.

587
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,080
You seem to suggest
I should take the discarded leavings
of Lady Mary Crawley,

588
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,000
dust off the fluff
and put them on my own plate.

589
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,560
~ That's not what Charles meant.
~ Isn't it?

590
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,680
Good. What a relief.
Now we won't have to quarrel.

591
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,120
Mabel, you're in love with Tony
Gillingham. You know you are.

592
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,720
All I know is that Tony
broke off our engagement,
which I had not deserved,

593
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,160
because Mary
crooked her little finger at him.

594
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,760
~ It was his choice, not mine.
~ So you say.

595
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,560
But now you're bored.
You want someone else to play with.

596
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,760
So, to dry his tears and keep him
occupied, you toss him back to me.

597
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,760
~ This isn't my idea.
~ Well, it certainly isn't mine.

598
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,680
You know, you're cutting off
your nose to spite your face.

599
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,040
~ I'm going. ~ Well, what shall we do
with your food?

600
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Eat it, and I hope it chokes you.

601
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,280
That was a big success (!)
What's your next suggestion?

602
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,760
No, I don't think we need
another plan. This was just a scene
we had to play.

603
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,080
Can you put the fricassee there?
We'll share it.

604
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,440
Now, I'd like my beef pink,
but not raw.

605
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,180
You didn't linger very long
over your Port.

606
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,580
Because we'd both rather be
with the ladies.

607
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,820
Edith, dear. There's something
I'd like to show you in the library.

608
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,500
~ What's that, Granny?
~ Oh, it's just a particular book

609
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,420
you might find interesting.

610
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,740
How is your fiery friend,
Miss Bunting?

611
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,140
I notice we don't see her here
as much as we used to.

612
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,860
~ Do you wonder at it? ~ Well,
it's good to be disagreed with.

613
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,460
Keeps you on your toes.

614
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,980
Then Lord Grantham must have been
on points from the moment
she walked through the door.

615
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,060
I hope you haven't broken with her.

616
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,020
She's gone. She left today.

617
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,100
Oh, I am sorry.

618
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,140
What about you, Rose? What happened
to the young man you met?

619
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,300
He's gone too.
He's starting a new job in London.

620
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,700
Oh, dear. What a sad conversation.

621
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,740
He was interesting.

622
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,340
He wasn't just the same old chap
one's supposed to dance with.
His family was unusual.

623
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,940
~ In what way? ~ They came here
from Odessa. 60 years ago.

624
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,740
They were driven out by the pogroms,
but they've done well.

625
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:30,340
Well, yes, that is interesting.

626
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,340
I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd think it was a mistake.

627
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,660
I suppose it never occurred to you
that I might be right?

628
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,140
What do you expect me to do?
Send her back?

629
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:42,100
It's too late. We can't get
the child back to Switzerland,

630
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,340
and there's no point
in keeping her here.

631
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,380
~ What do you mean?
~ That woman, Mrs...

632
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,060
~ Drewe. Mrs Drewe. ~ Well,
she's at the point of explosion.

633
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,900
We must get the child away.

634
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,420
But where would we go?

635
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
Not 'we', my dear.

636
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,980
There are schools that will take
children from any age.

637
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,180
We'll find one in France where
she'll be properly looked after.

638
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,500
I dare say you can even visit,
as long as you never reveal
who you are.

639
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,740
It'll be... quite manageable.

640
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,580
~ And you agree with this, Granny?
~ Well, I know it sounds very harsh.

641
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,100
But what else are we to do?

642
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,340
We're going up.

643
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,980
Mama, the car's ready
whenever you want it.

644
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,020
Oh, thank you, Cora.

645
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Good night.

646
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,180
We'll settle the details later.

647
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,100
But I promise you -
this is for the best.

648
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,420
Well, in my eyes,
that makes you innocent.

649
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:52,540
It makes you a victim of the crime,
quite as much as Mrs Benton.

650
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,340
Why didn't you tell me this before?

651
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,020
Because I knew you'd say
it proved my innocence,
when it does no such thing.

652
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,220
I'd rather not hide from the truth,
thank you.

653
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,820
Don't hide, then. But don't punish
yourself for ever, either.

654
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,740
No. But I have learned.

655
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,060
And I won't ever be controlled again.

656
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
I must go.

657
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,780
~ Mr Barrow said you wanted me.
~ Oh, come in and sit down.

658
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:25,100
~ Mrs Patmore's got something to say.
~ What's that?

659
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,420
Oh, just how grateful I am
for your excellent advice.

660
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,580
~ Oh, you've taken it, then?
~ I have. In a way.

661
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,140
You've invested in building?

662
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,540
Well, she's invested in a building,
yes.

663
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,700
I've found a cottage
in Haughton-le-Skerne,

664
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,980
and I'm going to see it on Tuesday.

665
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,780
It's £300, so it's a big decision,
but you've given me the courage.

666
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,820
Oh, that's not what I meant at all.

667
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,380
I thought you wanted to be in the
market, to increase your capital.

668
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,340
Well, I'll rent it now and later
I thought I'd take in some lodgers.
It's got three bedrooms.

669
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,260
Oh, this is very small beer.

670
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,740
Mr Carson, it's my kind of beer,
and I know how to drink it.

671
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,580
But you gave her the idea,
didn't you? She's very grateful.

672
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,380
Oh, I am. It's good to hear advice
from a man of the world.

673
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,500
Well, I like to do what I can.

674
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
We feel thoroughly protected.

675
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,060
Have you forgotten something?

676
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,620
It's not your maid.

677
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,940
I waited till she'd gone.

678
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,820
You must leave.

679
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,580
Mr Bricker, you must leave.

680
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,260
~ I hope I didn't wake you.
~ No, not at all, m'lord.

681
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:57,180
Miss Baxter's only just come down,
so Her Ladyship will still be awake.

682
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,860
Mr Bricker, I've asked you twice
now. Will you please go?

683
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,460
You said yourself -
who knows when I'll be back?

684
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,220
~ Mr Bricker -
~ Don't pretend, Cora.

685
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:08,300
You know something's happened
between us. You know things have
changed now.

686
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,380
I feel it and I know you do.

687
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,300
When did someone last cherish you?

688
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
When did someone even listen to you?

689
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,460
I've seen you with your family,
ignored and passed over.

690
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:29,420
~ None of this is any -
~ I'm glad you're still awake...

691
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,540
The dinner was over early.
It seemed easier to come back.

692
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,660
I'm sorry if it's a disappointment.

693
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,140
It isn't.
Mr Bricker was just leaving.

694
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,340
I'm not here at Lady Grantham's
invitation.

695
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,020
Then will you please leave at mine?

696
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,380
Robert, let him go.

697
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,660
You can't be surprised.

698
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,900
When you chose
to ignore a woman like Cora,

699
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,300
you must have known not every man
would be as blind as you.

700
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,740
Stop it!

701
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Stop it! Stop it!

702
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,420
Stop!

703
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,540
Mama?

704
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,140
Mama? Papa?
Is everything all right in there?

705
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,020
I'm so sorry, darling.
Your father and I
were just playing a stupid game

706
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,740
and we knocked over a lamp.

707
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:35,060
~ Oh. If you're sure.
~ I'm sure, poppet.

708
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Good night. Sleep tight.

709
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,700
~ I think that is my exit too.
~ Wait.

710
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,060
Golly. What a night.

711
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,220
I'll sleep in my dressing room.

712
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,220
Eat a proper breakfast and lunch.
There won't be time for more
than a cup of tea later.

713
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,780
I'll try to make it up.

714
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,780
When you've finished your duties,
I'd appreciate any help
you can give.

715
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,460
We'll clear the hall now.

716
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,660
But why aren't we giving
a proper dinner here?

717
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,620
I quite agree, Mrs Patmore.

718
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,380
Mrs Hughes would say
we must move with the times.

719
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,460
Yes. I would.

720
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,220
Do you have a bandage I can have?

721
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,700
~ Have you hurt yourself?
~ I haven't, no.

722
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:39,100
Mrs Bates, have you heard any more
from that policeman?

723
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,900
No.

724
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,100
Here we go. That's Lady Mary.

725
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,060
Do you think you will?

726
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,620
No. I hope not, anyway.

727
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,940
Why do you pester her with this?

728
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,020
Because I feel like it.

729
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,540
Mr Barrow. Upstairs, please.

730
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
You too, Mr Molesley.

731
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,540
The car is waiting, sir.
Your case is inside it.

732
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Thank you, Carson.

733
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Thank you.

734
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,940
The Lady Beaumont.
The Lord Howard of Glossop.

735
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,460
~ Lovely to see you.
~ Good evening.

736
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,260
~ Howard.
~ Lord Grantham.

737
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
I'd forgotten his father had died.

738
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Thank you, Barrow.

739
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,580
Oh, thank you.

740
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,900
My dear,
we can't leave things as they are.

741
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,060
It's a tinderbox.
It could go up at any moment.

742
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,900
Granny, if I was to take her
to London -

743
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,860
Oh, don't be ridiculous, my darling.
Think.

744
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,140
All I'm saying is,
there must be another way.

745
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:39,540
Well, how can there be?

746
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,340
Mrs Reginald Crawley
and the Lord Merton.

747
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,940
~ Hello, Isobel.
~ It's cousin Isobel.

748
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,020
And her follower.

749
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,740
The Earl and Countess of Woolton.

750
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,020
~ I'm fine. May I sit down?
~ Are you tired?

751
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,620
No, but I rather foolishly twisted
my ankle getting out of the car.

752
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,060
Oh, dear. Be careful - Lord Merton
will have you on the operating table

753
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:07,580
before you can say 'knife'.

754
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,460
What about Lady Ingleby's pearls?

755
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,860
I was so jealous, I wanted
to snatch them off her throat!

756
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,740
Sir Henry and Lady Lawson.

757
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,460
Well, that's that.

758
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,620
And you're back at your books,
I see.

759
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,620
I'm not giving up -
don't think I will.

760
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,500
And I wouldn't want you to.

761
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,860
Right, I'm going up.
Don't forget the light.

762
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,180
Oh, gracious! Good evening, m'lady.

763
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,980
I didn't expect to see you
down here. Mr Carson said
you'd all gone to bed.

764
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,980
I wanted to make a telephone call
without...

765
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,180
I wanted to make a private call.

766
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,340
And you thought
you'd use Mr Carson's phone?

767
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:48,140
~ I don't think he'd mind. Do you?
~ I'm sure he wouldn't.

768
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:50,460
Well, I'll leave you to it.
Good night, m'lady.

769
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,540
Good night.

770
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,140
I'd like to make a trunk call
to London.

771
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,980
The York & Ainsty
are holding a point-to-point
at Canningford Grange.

772
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,060
Can you see Aunt Mary?

773
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:21,500
You were always asking
if I need help.
Well, now's your chance. Help me.

774
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,580
~ If I talk to anyone, it'll be you.
~ Then talk to me. Please.

775
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,940
You're losing your sense
of the appropriate.

776
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,060
You're losing your sense of occasion.

777
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,140
You think I'm a murderer.

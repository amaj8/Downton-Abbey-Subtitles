2
00:00:43,747 --> 00:00:47,386
Gracious Mama, it's not like you to
meet a train.

3
00:00:47,387 --> 00:00:49,867
My dear, I'm taking you STRAIGHT to
the house.

4
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,975
We'll go back and change and return
for dinner.

5
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:55,775
Do you know what time she left
yesterday? Not precisely.

6
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:57,976
The rest of us were at the
point-to-point.

7
00:00:57,977 --> 00:01:00,775
We heard when we got back. What are
we going to say now?

8
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:05,015
I've been awake the whole night.
There's only one thing we can say.

9
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:07,176
We have to tell Cora.

10
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:09,256
Well, isn't that rather a betrayal?

11
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:12,176
If anything happens to Edith and Cora
learns later

12
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,536
we knew all along, she would never
forgive us.

13
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,655
And I wouldn't blame her.

14
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:20,056
You see, as a mother, it is her
right.

15
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,136
But you don't plan to tell Robert?

16
00:01:22,137 --> 00:01:24,455
He is Edith's father.
He's a man.

17
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:26,456
Men don't have rights.

18
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:32,655
They telephoned Lady Rosamund last
night. She's on her way here now.

19
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:35,215
It seems very hard they should have
guests staying

20
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:37,456
and more coming for dinner with this
going on.

21
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:39,936
They couldn't put them off without
telling them why.

22
00:01:39,937 --> 00:01:41,896
It'll make for a funny evening.

23
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:46,295
We still don't know anything.
We know she's in London.

24
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,935
She bought a ticket for King's
Cross. But where can she be hiding?

25
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:53,695
It seems a terrific imposition for
us to be here. Should we just leave?

26
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:58,096
Why? We've got Dicky Merton, the
Sinderbys and their son arriving.

27
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:01,056
We could put them off. Please don't.
They're looking forward to it.

28
00:02:01,057 --> 00:02:02,855
You are. I don't think we should.

29
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:06,255
We have to give the impression Edith
has gone away to stay somewhere.

30
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:09,335
How terribly worrying this is for
you. I'm so sorry.

31
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,535
Why the song and dance? Edith's gone
away. So what?

32
00:02:12,536 --> 00:02:15,295
We three should go for a walk and
leave them to talk.

33
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:18,295
Tony can be our guide. He must know
the gardens pretty well.

34
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:21,696
Maybe we should take some air.
I think we might emulate the others

35
00:02:21,696 --> 00:02:25,336
and let Cora show us the garden. I'm
not sure what good that'll do.

36
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:28,736
When I say we need some air, we need
some air. Cora.

37
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,216
If it's what you want. Mary, you can
manage the children when they get here.

38
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,895
Of course.

39
00:02:33,896 --> 00:02:36,215
There's a person downstairs, M'Lady.

40
00:02:36,216 --> 00:02:40,135
A Mrs Drewe from Yew Tree Farm.
She's very anxious to see you.

41
00:02:40,136 --> 00:02:43,855
Oh. Well, you'd better show her in
my sitting room.

42
00:02:43,856 --> 00:02:47,455
I'm sorry, Mama. You go ahead
without me.

43
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:49,655
I can take you for a walk if you
like.

44
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:52,296
Why would I want to walk?

45
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:02,015
I'm going in to change. I'll sneak
upstairs so I don't disturb them.

46
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,376
See you at dinner. Not if I see you
first.

47
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:12,335
I don't understand. You're so
well suited.

48
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:15,735
And you're much more relaxed with
her than you are with Mary. Yes.

49
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:19,175
You must admit it's odd - Mary is
trying to break off

50
00:03:19,176 --> 00:03:21,255
and Mabel is dying for love of you.

51
00:03:21,256 --> 00:03:24,815
I know. But I can't break it off
with Mary. Not now.

52
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,895
Why not?

53
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:31,175
Well, I won't explain it but suffice
to say, it wouldn't be honourable.

54
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:34,815
You are an old dear if you think I
don't know what you're talking about.

55
00:03:34,816 --> 00:03:37,456
But isn't it up to Mary?
It's not what she wants.

56
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:42,255
Not really. Did she look like a
woman today

57
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,256
trying to rid herself of a suitor?

58
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:48,735
You're muddling her instinct, which
is to hold every man in thrall,

59
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,896
and her wish, which is to break up.

60
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:54,096
I'm not convinced.
I wish you would be.

61
00:03:55,296 --> 00:03:57,296
For everyone's sake.

62
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:03,455
Who was that letter from?
Mr Brook.

63
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,735
He's got a new job in Salford so he
doesn't want to renew the lease.

64
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,735
We need to find another tenant.
Damn it.

65
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:11,375
Don't be ungrateful. I've blessed
your mother every day

66
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,535
for leaving us the house. When you
have property, you have choices.

67
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:19,975
What should we do? After he's gone,
let's ask for time off together.

68
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:22,696
Go down. See what condition he has
left it in then we can plan.

69
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:28,415
Why are you smiling?
Because whenever I see a problem,

70
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,816
you see only possibilities.

71
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:33,655
Did you both know?

72
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:37,695
Mrs Drewe told me Rosamund knew you
went to see the child with Edith.

73
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:41,215
Yes. And you never thought to tell
me I have a third grandchild.

74
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:42,856
Edith didn't want me to.

75
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:47,336
It makes sense of that bewildering
trip to Switzerland. What was I to do?

76
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:50,495
She wouldn't get rid of it.
Get rid of it? It was her idea.

77
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,015
But she wouldn't go through with it
in the end.

78
00:04:53,016 --> 00:04:57,016
And what did you know? Well, not
quite as much.

79
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,976
I knew why they were in Switzerland.

80
00:05:00,976 --> 00:05:04,576
I thought she'd left the baby there.
That was the idea.

81
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:08,335
Edith didn't stick to it. And you
never thought to involve me?

82
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:13,135
Her OWN mother. You, Rosamund, you
looked at that little girl

83
00:05:13,136 --> 00:05:15,175
and you never thought it was my
business too?

84
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:18,295
Well, we wanted to contain it.

85
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:21,535
To make as little noise abroad as
possible.

86
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:25,375
So what changed? What tipped her
over the edge and into running away?

87
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:28,495
Well, I suppose we all knew Mr
Gregson was dead

88
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:31,495
but the confirmation must have been
very upsetting.

89
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:33,975
And Mrs Drewe was being difficult.

90
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:36,896
Clearly the child couldn't stay
there indefinitely.

91
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,215
So, we thought...

92
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:43,135
What did you think? That it would be
better and safer

93
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,535
if the girl was sent abroad. Now, we
have it.

94
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:48,295
Edith was told her child would be
taken away.

95
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:51,615
Are you going to say anything to
Robert?

96
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:55,495
No. I agree with one thing -
the secret is not ours to tell.

97
00:05:55,496 --> 00:05:58,256
Somehow we must find Edith...

98
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:01,896
..and we must hear from her what SHE
wants.

99
00:06:10,696 --> 00:06:12,495
M'Lady.

100
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:15,415
I'm sorry to bother you. What is it,
Mrs Hughes?

101
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,576
It may have slipped your mind,
M'Lady,

102
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:20,016
but do you remember I gave you a
train ticket

103
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:22,495
when we came to London for Lady
Rose's ball?

104
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:25,175
It was a return ticket that I found
in the pocket

105
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,055
of Mr Bates' overcoat.
Of course I remember.

106
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:31,935
I don't suppose you put it anywhere
for safekeeping?

107
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:35,575
Why? Because we were wrong.

108
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:39,495
Far from proving Mr Bates went
to London on the day Mr Green died,

109
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:42,775
it proved he didn't. He bought the
ticket in York

110
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:46,495
but changed his mind and that's why
it was never given in.

111
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:49,335
So it was proof of his innocence not
his guilt?

112
00:06:49,336 --> 00:06:51,175
That's about the size of it.

113
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:55,456
I'm afraid I burnt it, Mrs Hughes.

114
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:59,976
Atticus.

115
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,855
Hello. Lord and Lady Sinderby.
Hello. Rose.

116
00:07:09,856 --> 00:07:13,375
Oh, you know my cousin. We were in
awe of your courage yesterday.

117
00:07:13,376 --> 00:07:17,296
Well, courage or foolhardiness. Come
and see Mama and Papa.

118
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:23,855
To be honest, we're in the middle of
rather a drama.

119
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:28,176
Which I'll tell you about but you
mustn't let on. Our first secret.

120
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:32,535
This is cold so it can go up now but
cover it till it's served.

121
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,895
Shall we work on Vanity Fair when
you've finished tonight? I dunno.

122
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:38,495
Well, I'll ask you later.

123
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:40,855
Lord Merton's arrived so everyone is
here.

124
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:44,456
I'll announce it when you're ready.
I will be by the time you say it.

125
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:47,575
You're very glum. Am I?

126
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:50,735
Don't tell me your enthusiasm for
learning is drying up.

127
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,935
Maybe. Have you read the papers
lately?

128
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:55,215
I wish I had the time!

129
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:58,375
Mr MacDonald seems to limp from
crisis to crisis.

130
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,895
They were going to do so much when
they came in.

131
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:04,655
The first Labour Government. Now, I
doubt they'll last the year.

132
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:06,895
Don't take it personally. But I do.

133
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,615
When I think about it, it seems to
me that we're trapped.

134
00:08:09,616 --> 00:08:13,575
Held fast in a system that gives us
no value and no freedom.

135
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,975
Oi. Speak for yourself! I am. I do.

136
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:19,255
And now I'm wondering. Is it worth
it me trying to better myself?

137
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:20,815
What's the point?

138
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:23,176
That's it. They're coming in.

139
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:37,775
Miss Baxter.

140
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:41,615
I'm afraid you think I've got you
both into trouble.

141
00:08:41,616 --> 00:08:44,655
I don't know what you mean. Yes, you
do.

142
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:48,015
I said I had no proof. I gave them
nothing that would stand up.

143
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:51,135
Why did you have to say anything?
I was in a difficult position.

144
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:55,896
So now you've put us in one.
I'm very sorry. I am. Truly.

145
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:00,296
I have to clean some shoes.

146
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:15,336
Are you enjoying Yorkshire? Well,
first, we and Yorkshire

147
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:18,255
have to get used to each other. But
you haven't come up against

148
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,975
too many impassable barriers. Lord Grantham,
we both know what we're up against.

149
00:09:21,976 --> 00:09:24,856
Happily, we're used to it. You won't
have any trouble with us.

150
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:28,815
Lady Grantham's father was Jewish.
That isn't a guarantee of tolerance.

151
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:30,776
So it's a relief to hear you say it.

152
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:34,736
Atticus seems to be very taken with
your niece.

153
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:36,656
And I must say...

154
00:09:37,736 --> 00:09:39,896
..I find her quite
charming.

155
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:45,095
Does Lord Sinderby approve? Well, you
know, he needs time

156
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:47,015
to settle into things.

157
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:49,455
Your mother never considered
converting.

158
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:52,015
I don't believe so.

159
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:56,455
Was it difficult? Having a different
religion from your father's?

160
00:09:56,456 --> 00:09:58,535
Not that I recall.

161
00:09:58,536 --> 00:10:00,575
Hm.

162
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:04,095
And you're not ashamed of him? Lord
Sinderby, I would point out

163
00:10:04,096 --> 00:10:06,375
that we never changed our name.

164
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:09,655
Hm. It was my grandfather's
decision.

165
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:12,895
I thought of changing it back but
the family felt they were English

166
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:14,575
now and they wanted to stay...

167
00:10:14,576 --> 00:10:15,935
English.

168
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,655
Have you decided at last whether you
are leaving?

169
00:10:18,656 --> 00:10:20,255
'At last' is the right phrase

170
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:23,015
but I want to make sure I do the
right thing.

171
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:26,176
I don't want to disrupt Sybbie's
life and then regret it.

172
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:28,136
You know they all want you to stay.

173
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,176
That only makes it more difficult.

174
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:36,216
Lord Grantham was saying Gregson
left Lady Edith his publishing company.

175
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,935
Yes. Then shouldn't someone
telephone the office?

176
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:42,575
Won't she go there? They must know
where to find her.

177
00:10:42,576 --> 00:10:46,095
Of course. How clever you are.

178
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:48,976
Why? It seems rather obvious to me.

179
00:10:50,136 --> 00:10:54,815
Your mother and Robert are hitting
it off. She's not the problem. Oh?

180
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,935
My father's the tough nut.

181
00:10:56,936 --> 00:11:00,975
My people are the other way round.
My father's a darling

182
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:04,176
and my mother's the nut. Then we
shall crack them against each other.

183
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,295
Strange how some people get married
and married and...

184
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,375
we can't manage it once.

185
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:15,616
Dogs barking in wrong trees spring to
mind.

186
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:20,575
Tony, I'm sorry if you feel
I'm tracking you round the country,

187
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:24,175
but I can't give up just yet.
We would be so happy if you'd let us.

188
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:26,215
And I won't be if I don't?

189
00:11:26,216 --> 00:11:29,975
I remember my mother telling me, that
in the end,

190
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,055
happiness is a matter of choice.

191
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:35,775
Some people choose to be happy and
others select a course

192
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:38,295
that leads only to frustration and
disappointment.

193
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:41,335
And I'm one of the latter.
I terribly hope not.

194
00:11:41,336 --> 00:11:43,896
For my sake.

195
00:11:46,696 --> 00:11:48,855
I have a little announcement.

196
00:11:48,856 --> 00:11:51,056
Are you sure? I am.

197
00:11:53,216 --> 00:11:56,695
You might like to know that Lord
Merton and I have decided

198
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,375
that we should get married.

199
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,295
How lovely.

200
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,175
Well, this calls for a toast.

201
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:06,215
I give you, Mrs Crawley.

202
00:12:06,216 --> 00:12:08,976
Or should I say, the future Lady
Merton.

203
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,215
The future Lady Merton!
The future Lady Merton.

204
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:18,535
Naturally, it was the last thing I
ever thought would happen.

205
00:12:18,536 --> 00:12:21,135
I forced her into it.

206
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:24,416
He wooed me into it and I'm terribly
pleased he did.

207
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,256
Well...

208
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:33,095
What's the matter, granny? I was
worried about Edith.

209
00:12:33,096 --> 00:12:35,616
I can't think why.

210
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:39,695
My dear, a lack of compassion can be
as vulgar

211
00:12:39,696 --> 00:12:41,256
as an excess of tears.

212
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,505
Ah, Daisy. Have you decided?

213
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:51,266
Shall we discuss the vices of Miss
Becky Sharp?

214
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:54,066
I'm tired. I'm going up. Good night,
Mrs Patmore.

215
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,265
What's that about?

216
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:01,266
She had such hopes of the Labour
Government, she feels let down.

217
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:04,465
But she mustn't give up. I don't
recall you being this keen

218
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,546
when Miss Bunting was teaching her.

219
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:10,665
I wouldn't interfere with
a professional but now she's gone,

220
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,425
I'd like to help if I can.

221
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:15,385
Sounds to me as if you've missed out
on your vocation.

222
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:17,745
Tell Daisy. Perhaps you can change
her mind.

223
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:22,305
She wouldn't listen to me.
Well spotted. What about Mr Mason?

224
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:25,305
Funnily enough, Mr Barrow might be
right for once.

225
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,906
How do we get him to speak to her?
Let me think on it.

226
00:13:35,266 --> 00:13:38,665
I'm sorry if I seem distracted
but I'm truly so happy for you both.

227
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,945
I thought I'd give a dinner so she
could meet my sons.

228
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,545
Well, she has met Larry before.
Let's hope she's forgotten!

229
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:48,705
Why don't we do it here? We could
invite Granny and everyone.

230
00:13:48,706 --> 00:13:52,945
You are my godfather and Isobel is
the grandmother of my child.

231
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:55,505
Oh, please let's. It seems only
right, Mama.

232
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,985
Of course. If you'd like. Oh, that
would be very kind.

233
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,505
A signing of the bond between our
families.

234
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,225
I wish we didn't know the anguish
lurking around.

235
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,265
You love other people's secrets.

236
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,585
Not these days.

237
00:14:07,586 --> 00:14:09,985
I can't tell you why I can't leave
Mary but...

238
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:13,305
you'd understand if I did.
Just promise me it's a struggle.

239
00:14:13,306 --> 00:14:15,266
More than you know.

240
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:19,865
We must go but it's been such fun.
I hope you come to us next time.

241
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:24,345
We should love it. I suppose we just
have to wait and see what happens.

242
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:27,786
No need to hurry them into anything.
They're both very young.

243
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,065
Well, I would be delighted
if something were to come of it.

244
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,746
Good night, Lady Grantham. Lady
Rosamund.

245
00:14:35,746 --> 00:14:38,025
The door, please, Molesley.

246
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:40,625
They're so easy in each other's
company. Anyone can see.

247
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,705
But he won't let me go.

248
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:45,625
Because you refuse to make it clear
that you want him to.

249
00:14:45,626 --> 00:14:47,985
Just as he's moving off, you tug his
strings.

250
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:50,665
Send a clear message and he'll go.
I promise.

251
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,626
What is that message?

252
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,466
We'll think of something.

253
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:59,785
Atticus says the London office of
the magazine must know

254
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,865
how to get in touch with Edith.

255
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:05,505
I thought we weren't going to tell
anyone. He's not anyone, is he?

256
00:15:05,506 --> 00:15:10,025
Of course not. We could ring them
tomorrow but maybe I should go.

257
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,065
Mr Aldridge is leaving.

258
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,026
Oh.

259
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,105
I'll train up in the morning.
I'm coming with you. I'm not going.

260
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:22,705
I'll have a horrible day worrying.
Trust me.

261
00:15:22,706 --> 00:15:25,066
How can you imagine I'll ever trust
you again?

262
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,145
She doesn't mean it. On the
contrary.

263
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,386
It's the most honest thing she's
ever said to me.

264
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:39,026
There you are.
Thank you.

265
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,786
Is our life overcomplicated?

266
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:55,425
In what way? Mrs Patmore is buying a
house up here.

267
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,985
Why don't we sell the London house
and do the same?

268
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,585
We could rent it out as long as we
want to work out Downton.

269
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:04,225
And then live in it when we retire.
We had a dream once.

270
00:16:04,226 --> 00:16:07,025
Of a small hotel in the area.

271
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:10,585
A London house, even a little one,
would buy something substantial here.

272
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:12,546
I hate to say his name...

273
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:17,466
..but do you feel the whole business
of Mr Green might be over?

274
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,065
For us, I mean. Well, they seem to
have accepted the fact

275
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:24,065
that I spent the day in York and
Miss Baxter has given them

276
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,385
nothing new to go on. So we can dare
to plan our future again.

277
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,425
Like normal people. Does that mean
what I hope it means?

278
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:33,545
Mr Bates, I thought you'd decided to
believe me

279
00:16:33,546 --> 00:16:36,145
when I said that device was Lady
Mary's? I do believe you.

280
00:16:36,146 --> 00:16:39,665
I don't know why she wanted it but
I believe you. Well, then...

281
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,865
You don't suppose there's anything
wrong with us, do you?

282
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:44,945
No.

283
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:47,625
I think it takes some people longer
than others.

284
00:16:47,626 --> 00:16:48,825
That's all.

285
00:16:48,826 --> 00:16:50,946
What would I do without you?

286
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:59,146
Did they get away? Just about. The
train was late, thank heaven.

287
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:03,665
And it isn't going to be Tony?
I don't think so.

288
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:06,985
Nor Charles. He decided that before
I did. Well, well.

289
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:12,145
I don't suppose your ancient
father's opinion carries much weight.

290
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:15,706
'Fraid not. And I've just remembered
I said I'd go and see granny.

291
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,505
So, I don't think Tony is going to
be my next son-in-law.

292
00:17:24,506 --> 00:17:27,226
I don't believe he is.

293
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:31,265
Pity. I'd have been so pleased but
there we are.

294
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:34,625
You're really not yourself, are you,
old girl?

295
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:37,465
And what about you? We don't want
you to be on your own forever.

296
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:40,665
Just to pick someone who shares the
family's values.

297
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:44,305
Someone who feels friendly towards
us is not the same thing. No.

298
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:49,465
You're right. And I don't blame you
for the departure of Miss Bunting.

299
00:17:49,466 --> 00:17:52,305
I didn't want to spend my life in a
bare knuckle fight.

300
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,465
But something's changed. I feel it.

301
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:56,426
I may as well tell you.

302
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,825
I've written to my cousin in Boston.

303
00:17:59,826 --> 00:18:02,826
He's done well there and I'd like
his advice. I see.

304
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,065
I apologise if my bad manners have
brought this on.

305
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:12,025
No need to apologise. I am what I am
and you are what you are.

306
00:18:12,026 --> 00:18:14,305
Never the twain shall meet!
I wouldn't say that.

307
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,345
I do love you all, you know.

308
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,785
It'll be hard to go.

309
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:20,626
On both sides.

310
00:18:22,346 --> 00:18:25,786
But we have no way of knowing
if Lady Edith will come in today.

311
00:18:25,787 --> 00:18:28,985
It's already tea-time and we close
the office at six.

312
00:18:28,986 --> 00:18:32,426
Then we'll wait until six. And we'll
come back in the morning.

313
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:36,866
And every day till she either turns
up or contacts you with her whereabouts.

314
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,905
It wouldn't be enough to give her
a message that you want to see her?

315
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:42,146
No, it would not be enough.

316
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:49,265
You've told her, haven't you?

317
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,465
You've broken your word.

318
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:54,825
No. I've... Mrs Drewe came to the
house.

319
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:58,585
What did she want? She felt you had
used her badly.

320
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,625
I confess it was a feeling we
shared.

321
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:04,225
I'm not coming back, you know. Let's
not talk about it here.

322
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,666
Come to me for dinner. No.

323
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:11,265
Very well, we'll discuss it now in
front of your new employees

324
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:13,226
and give them something to chew on.

325
00:19:14,346 --> 00:19:16,426
There is a tea room at the end of
the street.

326
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,985
How are you, Spratt? Well, I hope.

327
00:19:25,986 --> 00:19:30,025
Everyone has their troubles, M'Lady.
Oh, dear.

328
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,905
Spratt has been helping to train my
new maid. Denker.

329
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:36,385
I'd say she takes
after the dachshund, M'Lady.

330
00:19:36,386 --> 00:19:39,585
In what way?
She's QUITE untrainable.

331
00:19:39,586 --> 00:19:43,386
Spratt. Will there be anything else,
Your Ladyship?

332
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,025
Sounds like trouble to me.

333
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:53,105
Are you certain Denker is worth it?

334
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:55,945
Oh, you must put dinner on Friday
into your diary.

335
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,505
That's when Dicky Merton is coming
with his sons.

336
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:01,825
Yes. I wonder if it is a good idea.

337
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,825
Isobel has got to meet them some
time.

338
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:08,345
And Larry won't make trouble for Tom
again. Not with Sybil dead.

339
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:10,306
Let us hope not.

340
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:14,905
Granny, I know why you're finding
this difficult.

341
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:19,265
Do you? Yes, but you mustn't give in
to it.

342
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,465
What? Give in to what? Isobel has
always been your protege.

343
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:26,305
She looks up to you and you have
kept her from harm in return.

344
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:28,385
Have I?

345
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,945
Yes. So of course it's difficult
that she is to take her place

346
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,505
among the leaders of the county.
Why?

347
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:37,385
Why is it difficult? You needn't
pretend.

348
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:42,065
Your positions have changed - you
the widow in the Dower House,

349
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:46,105
Isobel a great lady presiding over a
great house.

350
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:48,746
But you simply have to be bigger
than that.

351
00:20:52,346 --> 00:20:54,425
Is that what you think of me?

352
00:20:54,426 --> 00:20:57,665
That I care about her change of
rank?

353
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:00,585
Well, you're not exactly pleased,
are you?

354
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:04,746
No. But that is not the reason.

355
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:07,625
Then what is?

356
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,586
If you must know...

357
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:13,546
..I have got used to having a
companion.

358
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,625
A friend. You know, someone to talk
things over with.

359
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:21,905
Well, you'll still have us. You have
your own lives.

360
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,866
And so you should.

361
00:21:25,666 --> 00:21:29,545
But Isobel and I had a lot in
common.

362
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,506
And...

363
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:34,425
..I shall miss her.
Granny,

364
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:38,465
you're quite dewy-eyed.
I never think of you as sentimental.

365
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,426
Nor am I.

366
00:21:41,106 --> 00:21:44,185
You've made me regret my confidence.
Do have some cake.

367
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:46,425
And for your information...

368
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:51,146
I don't think Isobel has EVER looked
up to me.

369
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:56,505
Now, we drop the sticks in together
when I say.

370
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,466
Ready? Go!

371
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,585
Where are they?

372
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:07,385
There it is. It's me! It's me!
Yes.

373
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:09,346
Now make a wish.

374
00:22:11,986 --> 00:22:15,985
Darling, you know Aunt Edith has
gone to London? Yes.

375
00:22:15,986 --> 00:22:18,065
Well, I was thinking...

376
00:22:18,066 --> 00:22:22,265
I wonder what if we were to leave
here and go and live

377
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,345
in a place far away across the sea?

378
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:26,666
What would you say?
Why?

379
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:30,146
Well, because...

380
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:34,266
..it might be better for us to start
a new life there. Why?

381
00:22:36,346 --> 00:22:38,306
Because...

382
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,865
Because I hope to God I'm doing the
right thing.

383
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,425
That's the stable clock.

384
00:22:45,426 --> 00:22:47,386
WE had better get back.

385
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:06,785
I've got an idea and I've told Mrs
Hughes but I want you to know it.

386
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:10,345
I could swear the train ticket
hadn't been used. I would swear it.

387
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:14,785
What? I saw the ticket in Mrs Hughes'
hand when she found it in the coat.

388
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:17,745
It hadn't been torn in half. It was
whole. I saw it.

389
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:19,785
Did you? Indeed.

390
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,865
Things have moved on, Miss Baxter.

391
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,265
They know Mr Bates was in York on
that day.

392
00:23:24,266 --> 00:23:26,105
I just wanted to be helpful.

393
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:29,585
We know how you like to be helpful,
Miss Baxter.

394
00:23:29,586 --> 00:23:32,385
By talking to the police about us.

395
00:23:32,386 --> 00:23:35,905
Excuse me, I couldn't help
overhearing.

396
00:23:35,906 --> 00:23:40,505
Miss Baxter won't say it but she's
in a difficult position.

397
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:44,465
On the contrary, Miss Baxter keeps
saying it.

398
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,025
She says nothing else.

399
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:50,466
Mr Molesley, can you remove
the baize from the tables, please?

400
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,505
I'm ready to go up.

401
00:23:56,506 --> 00:23:58,466
I'll come with you.

402
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:06,745
Ignore them. I can't. I feel sorry
for them.

403
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,905
Then tell them why you had to talk
to the police.

404
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,266
I'd feel ashamed.

405
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,825
You're in luck. I'm only just back.

406
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:23,226
Listen carefully. Today, I learned I've been
posted on a trade delegation to Poland.

407
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:26,265
I'll be gone for months. Some people
have all the fun.

408
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,585
I want you to come up to London
tomorrow.

409
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:31,785
I've things I can't get out of
in the morning. That doesn't matter.

410
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:35,065
I just need you from about seven
o'clock on. What for?

411
00:24:35,066 --> 00:24:38,305
Mabel's given me an idea of
how to settle it once and for all.

412
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:41,545
Just be here. What sort of clothes?

413
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,185
Rags. We're going to the Kinema. Ring
me when you get to London.

414
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:47,386
Your wish is my command. Bye.

415
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:55,465
I'm worried about Isis.
Why? What's the matter with her?

416
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:59,105
She's not looking too clever. Did you
manage to get hold of Mr Stapeley?

417
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:02,345
I spoke to his wife, My Lord. He's
away until Friday.

418
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,425
Do you want me to try to find
someone else? No.

419
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,945
I'll take her there myself on Friday
afternoon. Has the gong been rung?

420
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:11,105
Just. Why do we bother to change?
It's you, me, Mary and Tom.

421
00:25:11,106 --> 00:25:13,665
Don't let Aunt Violet hear you.
Where have you been?

422
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:16,185
I went to have tea with Atticus. We
met halfway in Ripon.

423
00:25:16,186 --> 00:25:19,665
It's getting quite serious then?
Fingers crossed.

424
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:23,145
But darling, you don't want to rush
into anything. Oh, but I do.

425
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:25,305
I want to rush in like billy-o.

426
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:27,745
Rose, it's a big thing you're
contemplating.

427
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:30,025
Bigger still because of the
circumstances.

428
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:33,065
You sound like Lord Sinderby. I can
see he wasn't keen.

429
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,225
He doesn't want Atticus to marry out
of the faith. He minds.

430
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:39,345
Why shouldn't he mind? He's an
important figure in that community.

431
00:25:39,346 --> 00:25:42,025
But you're not against it, are you?
Of course not.

432
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:45,706
Still, I think you ought to write to
your parents. Daddy won't stop me.

433
00:25:45,706 --> 00:25:49,346
I don't believe he will. And Mummy
hates everyone so what's the difference?

434
00:25:49,411 --> 00:25:54,146
Even so, it's best not to pretend
it'll be plain sailing.

435
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:03,097
Where's Marigold? The hotel arranges
a baby-sitter when you need one.

436
00:26:03,098 --> 00:26:05,855
May I see her? I don't think so.

437
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,655
Not tonight. So what are you going
to do?

438
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:11,216
I was toying for a while with the
idea of going to America.

439
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:14,781
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Why is it
ridiculous? She's half American.

440
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,739
I thought I'd drop my title and
invent a dead husband.

441
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,900
Then I'd be Mrs Thing in Detroit or
Chicago.

442
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,559
Where I wouldn't run into anyone I
knew. So, is that your plan?

443
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,399
I don't want the magazine business
to fall into ruin.

444
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,440
How could I keep an eye on it
overseas?

445
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,159
And I would like Marigold to grow up
English. What is the alternative?

446
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,439
An invented dead husband here? I'd
never get away with it in London.

447
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,239
I thought I'd make her my orphaned
godchild.

448
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,200
Well, I have a different plan.

449
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,359
I'd like you to bring her home.
No.

450
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,719
I won't be the county failure. Poor
demented Lady Edith

451
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,839
who lost her virtue and her reason.

452
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,760
Just listen to my plan.

453
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,959
The Drewes would reach a reluctant
conclusion

454
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,440
that they can't afford to raise
their friend's child.

455
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:10,199
You've grown so fond of the girl,
you ask if she might join

456
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,839
the others in the Downton nursery.
The Drewe plan was mad enough.

457
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,359
But this is COMPLETELY ludicrous.

458
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,519
How could it possibly work?
Papa must never know the truth.

459
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,680
I've thought about it and don't
agree.

460
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,320
It would take time for him to get
used to the idea, he would make it.

461
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:29,039
He'd never look at me in the same
way again. Very well.

462
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,119
If that's how you feel, he doesn't
have to know. Nor Mary.

463
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,040
I couldn't have her queening
it over me.

464
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,240
No-one has to know who doesn't know
- your grandmother, Rosamund, you and me.

465
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,679
Everyone else will be told the
story.

466
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,199
And how would we execute this
insanity?

467
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,399
A farmer's foster child turns up in
the Downton nursery?

468
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,079
People adopt babies all the time
from all kinds of backgrounds.

469
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,919
So you're going to do this?
I'll telephone Mr Drewe tonight

470
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,999
when we get back to Belgrave Square
and I'll ask for his help.

471
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,479
And what about his wife?
Let him manage her.

472
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,439
Edith and I will go home tomorrow.
I'll ask Mr Drewe to meet the train

473
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,679
and take Marigold, then
we'll discuss the Drewes' situation.

474
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,279
At last, Edith will fetch the girl
and bring her back in broad daylight.

475
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,920
Time to call it a day, ladies.

476
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
I couldn't agree more.

477
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,040
And one for you, Mr Moseley.

478
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,439
I'm going out with Lady Mary this
afternoon but only for the night.

479
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,599
You didn't have much warning. I know.
Something has come up.

480
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,519
I suppose there's no point in you
looking in on the house. Not now.

481
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,159
Leave it till Mr Brook's left and we
can both go.

482
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,999
Ooh, it's an invitation from Mr
Mason. What? My Mr Mason?

483
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,039
Your Mr Mason. He wants us to come
to the farm tomorrow for luncheon.

484
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,000
If we can get the time off.

485
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,279
Why don't you go with them? I'm sure
Her Ladyship wouldn't mind.

486
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,239
What is it to you? You did me a good
turn when I'd done you a bad one.

487
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,399
So I think you deserve a treat. He's
right. It'll do you good.

488
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,479
But I've not been asked.

489
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,039
Mr Mason would be glad to see you
but would Mr Carson let us go?

490
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,759
Ooh, I think he will if you allow me
to handle it.

491
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,319
He won't like it when we've got a
big dinner on.

492
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,439
Just let me tell him. I'm the one
with the extra work.

493
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
Would Miss Baxter be able to come
with us? As Mr Barrow says.

494
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,520
Well, I don't see why not as long as
you're back in time. You can go early.

495
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,759
I still don't understand why he'd
write to Mr Moseley.

496
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,119
I might have mentioned he's been
helping you with your books.

497
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,080
I write to him now and then.

498
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,199
Can you see him? Not yet.

499
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh, my God. There's Mary.

500
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,480
What? There's Mr Drewe. What shall
we do? Leave it to me.

501
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,440
Mr Drewe. Can you help my mother
with her suitcases?

502
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,319
My sister Mary is on the platform.
Go to the next station and come back.

503
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll cover the cost.

504
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,640
Come on you. That's it. Come on,
darling. It's just a game.

505
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,000
So, you found her. I did.

506
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,360
I don't know what the fuss was
about. I wanted a day or two in London.

507
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:42,280
I knew it. I said that's all it was.
What a nonsense they made.

508
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,399
Why are you here? I'm catching the
first train to London. It's due any minute.

509
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,400
When will you be back? I'm not sure.
Tomorrow, I think.

510
00:30:49,401 --> 00:30:51,480
Don't forget the dinner on Friday.

511
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,880
We have a duty to protect Isobel
from Larry Grey.

512
00:30:53,881 --> 00:30:55,879
I don't think he'll try anything,
do you?

513
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, have a lovely time. I'm sure I
will.

514
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,960
That was close.

515
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,319
Have I met your younger son? I
remember the elder one.

516
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,679
I should think you do.

517
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,320
After his outburst the last time.

518
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,720
But Larry was fond of Sybil and not
about to welcome the man who'd won her.

519
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:24,679
Let us hope the years since have made
him more forgiving.

520
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,559
I'm looking forward to it and think
we should make no reference

521
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,839
to the earlier meeting. How lucky I
am in you.

522
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,480
I know it every time you speak.
Flatterer.

523
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,679
I should be going. I'll see you on
Friday. I can't wait.

524
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,120
Thank you so much for my lovely tea.
Not a bit.

525
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,800
Spratt will see you out.

526
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,919
Spratt still looks rather down in
the mouth.

527
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm afraid the battles with Denker
are far from resolved.

528
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,239
It's good to have a moment alone to
say how much I appreciate

529
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,279
your kindness to Dicky. I know you
don't approve.

530
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,999
Which makes you all the more
generous. It's too late to stop it.

531
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,199
How is Prince Kuragin?

532
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,839
I haven't heard from him lately. Why?

533
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,319
I was wondering how you were going
to manage when the Princess arrives.

534
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,799
Will you receive her here? Well, I'm
not sure.

535
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,199
Since Shrimpie hasn't found her yet,
I've got time to plan.

536
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,039
- Ah.
- Oh!

537
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,319
What is it now, Spratt?

538
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,399
I'm sorry to bother Your Ladyship.
Especially when you have company.

539
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,119
I'm afraid I must...
hand in my notice.

540
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,679
I have suffered as much as anyone
can expect to suffer

541
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,719
in the course of their duties.

542
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,759
I can take no more, M'Lady.

543
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,440
I can take no more.

544
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,559
Typical Spratt.

545
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,519
He's as touchy as a beauty losing her
looks.

546
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,199
You don't think he meant it? If he
did, he'd have given it quietly.

547
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,959
For a good reference in return. No.
No.

548
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,479
It's a demonstration of discontent.
So you'll forgive his outburst?

549
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Anything rather than find a new
butler.

550
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,559
Why did we have to rush out? Come
and stand here.

551
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,679
I still don't understand. You will.

552
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,039
Do exactly as I tell you and you
will. Kiss me.

553
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,440
What? Kiss me. Now!

554
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,759
Mary.

555
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,759
What are you doing here? So what did
you think of the film?

556
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,159
There was no need to stage a
tableau.

557
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,279
If you'd just told me I was allowed
to walk away, I'd have gone.

558
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,639
Without any silly games. But I DID
tell you. Often.

559
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,279
And you didn't go. Well, I'm going
now.

560
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,799
I know. And I wish you both such
happiness, Tony.

561
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,319
I do. I don't want to hurry anyone
but can we bring this to an end?

562
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,159
I've had quite enough sentiment from
John Barrymore and I'm starving.

563
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,000
Goodbye, Mary. And good luck to you.

564
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,039
I'm glad to have engineered a
resolution

565
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,199
even if I should have thought of it
long ago. He said we didn't need to.

566
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,839
But I know we did. It's funny. I
feel quite sad in a way.

567
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,639
But not sad enough to change my
mind.

568
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,120
She's nice, you know. She'll suit him
very well. Good. I'm glad.

569
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,919
So, what now? Shall
we find ourselves some dinner too?

570
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,999
Let's. We'll toast the fun we've had.

571
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And whatever the future may bring
us.

572
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,879
When are you off to Poland? I catch
the boat train on Monday.

573
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,719
So I'm scrambling around trying to
get everything done.

574
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,559
When are you back? Oh, not for
months or even a year.

575
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
You'll be married by then.

576
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
There. Are we all finished?

577
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,519
How lovely, Daisy, to have such a
beautiful place to come to.

578
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,439
She's always welcome is Daisy. I've
not been here enough lately.

579
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,119
You've been busy I know. With your
books.

580
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,999
That takes up time. I think I'll
stop it now.

581
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,599
So I'll be able to visit more.

582
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,999
Do you think she's right to give up
her studies, Mr Mason? I do NOT.

583
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,079
Don't you want to see more of me?
You know I do.

584
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,559
But education is power. Don't forget
that.

585
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,239
There's no limit to what you can
achieve

586
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,839
if you'll just give a year or two to
mastering those books. I agree.

587
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,359
There are millions out there who
could have done so much

588
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,199
if they'd only been given an
education.

589
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,159
I'm one of 'em. I could have made
something worthwhile of my life

590
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,279
if I'd had the chance. Don't talk as
if your life were not worthwhile...

591
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,359
when I know it is. I think
the system is slanted against us.

592
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,159
The men in charge will always be the
men in charge.

593
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,639
How can you say that with a Labour
Government in power?

594
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,399
I doubt they'll last the year. Next
time, when they're elected,

595
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,479
it'll be for longer, and soon

596
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,000
a Labour Government might seem
ordinary.

597
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,119
Do you think I should stick at it?
I do!

598
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,239
And now, we ought to think
about getting you back to the bus.

599
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,159
Let me take these. No. No.

600
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,199
Daisy and I are your hosts.

601
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,200
Thank you. Well, thank you.

602
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,919
He's made a daughter out
of his widowed daughter-in-law.

603
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,920
I like it when good things come from
bad.

604
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,679
Have you thought of explaining to
Mr Bates why you had to speak out?

605
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,759
He'd understand if anyone would.

606
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,800
He's troubles enough
without burdening him with mine.

607
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,599
We should go. We must be back in
good time for Mrs Crawley's dinner.

608
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,999
Mr Carson says there was trouble
the last time

609
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,359
Lord Merton's elder son came to
Downton. What happened?

610
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,479
Alfred told me if Mr Branson hadn't
been too drunk to stand

611
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
we'd have had fisticuffs on the
table.

612
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,080
And here's my thinking life
in a great house must be dull work.

613
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Walk on.

614
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:17,769
Do Mr and Mrs Drewe really want you
to take her?

615
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,739
Or is it just a way of keeping her
here till they have her back?

616
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,099
I don't think so. They simply can't
afford another child.

617
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,420
And there aren't any prior claims?
Apparently not.

618
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:30,099
That's why they took her in the
first place.

619
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,700
What did he say? Is she carrying
puppies?

620
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,580
I don't see how that could have
happened. It's not that.

621
00:37:36,581 --> 00:37:39,299
She's got cancer. Poor old thing.

622
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,179
Oh, no. Oh, how I hate that word.

623
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,259
He said it won't take long now.

624
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,979
He offered to put her down there and
then but I couldn't let him.

625
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,980
Oh, Papa. I'm so, so sorry.

626
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,100
Of course, it was stupid to mind so
much.

627
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,819
She doesn't even know who I am beyond
the hand that feeds her

628
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,779
but even so...

629
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,699
We'll keep her right here. This is
her spot.

630
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,819
She'll know she's back at home.

631
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,659
I suppose we can't stop this ghastly
dinner tonight.

632
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,619
I don't see how. Dicky's sons have
come from London.

633
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,379
And Atticus was on the same train.
No, of course we can't put it off.

634
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,059
I wasn't thinking. Why don't we say
that you're ill?

635
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,539
I could watch her. I don't have to
go to the dinner. I think you do.

636
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,340
To lay the ghost of the last time
Larry Grey was here.

637
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,459
I asked them to bring them down
early.

638
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,899
Hello, Daddy. Come to Mama, darling.

639
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,580
Hello, my darling.

640
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,859
So, how should I answer?

641
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,699
What's this about? The child at the
Drewe's house.

642
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,739
Oh. It seems idiotic to me.

643
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,459
And me. What about if you want to
start a family of your own?

644
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,379
But I dote on her. If they send her
to some horrid orphanage,

645
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,699
I'd never forgive myself. Can't you
just give them some money?

646
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,820
So they can keep her.
I think...

647
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,539
..Mrs Drewe finds it too much. It
isn't only the money.

648
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,860
It seems a bit feeble. Does it?
Looking at these two.

649
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,139
So, should I take her?

650
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,300
Papa?

651
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:22,139
I'll leave it to your mother.
Well...

652
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,659
I believe we should offer little
Marigold a home here.

653
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,620
Do you really, darling?

654
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,780
Well, then, I suppose that's
settled.

655
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,299
Have all the guests arrived?

656
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,539
I think so. I should tell
Mrs Patmore it won't be long now.

657
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,499
What are these?

658
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,979
Mr Carson's got a notion he and I
might buy a place

659
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:56,619
as an investment and maybe run it as
a guesthouse or rent it out.

660
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,699
How strange.

661
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,219
Mr Bates was talking about doing
something similar.

662
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,539
I suppose we're all beginning
to think of a different future

663
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,860
whether we want to or not.

664
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,539
The other day, Mr Drewe was on the
platform.

665
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,539
When Lady Mary and I were waiting
for the London train.

666
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,299
Oh, yes. Then her Ladyship and Lady
Edith arrived.

667
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,859
And he got into their carriage. He
helped lift their bags out.

668
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,300
But then he just stayed there.
In first class?

669
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,420
That'll have cost him a pretty
penny.

670
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,420
When the train moved off, I thought
for a moment he had a child on his lap.

671
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:38,219
I may have been wrong. Anna, you
shouldn't involve yourself

672
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,019
in any speculation of that sort.

673
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,379
The child is safe and the child is
loved.

674
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,420
And that's all we need to be sure
of.

675
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,379
I've been hearing about Edith's
plan. How marvellous of her.

676
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,699
If you ask me, it's absolutely
crackers.

677
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,860
Cora seems pleased. What idea is
this?

678
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,060
Edith has taken in a motherless
child and is giving her a home here.

679
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:08,419
I should have thought an orphan an
uncomfortable piece of baggage

680
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,899
for an unmarried woman.

681
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,300
You mean a man might not want
to take the child on?

682
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,300
Well, I wouldn't.

683
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,940
Rose, have you written to your mother
about Mr Aldridge? I have now.

684
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:25,779
And will she approve? Don't be
disappointing, Aunt Violet, please.

685
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,419
I promise you we know difference in
religion is a big thing.

686
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,899
Quite right. How would you bring up
any children, for example? Children?

687
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,659
When did this happen? Talking
hypothetically.

688
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,419
The fact is, most marriages that
fail,

689
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,859
founder for precisely this kind of
reason.

690
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,499
An irreconcilable difference.
Or maybe they just don't get on.

691
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,179
No, I'd agree with Larry.
It's usually more than that.

692
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,779
It might be different beliefs, or
different nationalities

693
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,859
or a huge age gap.

694
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,659
It the end, they cannot see
eye-to-eye.

695
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,379
I don't see what you're getting at.
You mean to marry Mrs Crawley.

696
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,259
She seems very nice and I wish you
both every happiness.

697
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,739
Thank you.

698
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:12,579
But that doesn't prevent me from
seeing the wide disparity in class

699
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,019
and background may prove your
undoing.

700
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,699
What did you say? Only that Mrs
Crawley, a decent middle class woman

701
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,180
with neither birth nor fortune
is expecting to fill another's shoes

702
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,340
as one of the leaders of the county.

703
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,459
Is she capable of it?

704
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,139
Or will her inevitable failure prove
a source of misery to them both?

705
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,579
Do you know Mrs Crawley's late son
was my heir?

706
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,059
What does that prove? Everyone has
distant cousins who are odd.

707
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,780
How dare you?! Will you GO, Larry?

708
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,980
I had to make excuses for your
rudeness the last time

709
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,620
you sat at this table. It is tiring
to think I should be called upon

710
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,580
to do so AGAIN. I know the choice of
in-laws is eccentric.

711
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,300
In this family, you already boast a
chauffeur and soon you can claim a Jew -

712
00:42:55,301 --> 00:42:57,380
Why don't you just get out, you
bastard?!

713
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,940
And suddenly we've slipped into a
foreign tongue.

714
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,019
Well, if that is how you feel?

715
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,740
I do not endorse Tom's language but
that is certainly how we all feel.

716
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:16,220
Then, Lady Grantham, goodbye.

717
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,220
And thank you for a delightful
evening.

718
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,980
What did you imagine?

719
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,860
That we would welcome you with open
arms?

720
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,459
He actually called him that? He did.
Right to his face.

721
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,220
Mr Moseley, please.
I think he was right to say it.

722
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,780
He may have been right but I will not
have bad language in front of the maids.

723
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:54,860
I feel sorry for Mrs Crawley. Why
should she be humiliated?

724
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,019
They're leaving early.
No wonder.

725
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,899
Mr Moseley, why are you
down here? Not gossiping I hope?

726
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,660
Oh, no, no, Mr Carson, no.

727
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,499
Golly, what an evening.

728
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,419
We won't forget it in a hurry. Let
us remember it for two reasons.

729
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,899
One bad, one good. What's the good
one? I hope it is good.

730
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,619
I'm listening. See, the thing is, it
occurs to me

731
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,499
that we're already having to defend
ourselves. Yes.

732
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,339
Let's have a real reason to.
That is, if you feel equal to it.

733
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,259
I'm not going to give you an answer
until you say it properly.

734
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,099
Do I have to kneel down?
Of course.

735
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,419
But you don't have to stay kneeling
for very long.

736
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,940
Rose, darling Rose...

737
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,419
..will you marry me?

738
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,499
Oh, you can get up now. Come on.

739
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,979
We ought to be serious. The truth is
we haven't known each other long.

740
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,459
And they're right. There are bound
to be problems. The way I see it,

741
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,099
we both know we're going to get
married in the end.

742
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,139
We know we're right together.
Yes!

743
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,819
I suppose we do.
That's all I need to hear.

744
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,419
I'll telephone tomorrow

745
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,740
and we'll settle who tells what
to whom and when. Oh, darling.

746
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,179
I'm going to wait in the car. Take
as long as you like.

747
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,220
We'll laugh about this one day.
The sooner, the better.

748
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,780
Night. Good night.

749
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,539
Tell me it won't change your mind.
I can't talk about this tonight,

750
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,699
nor for some time to come.

751
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,019
And I think Rose and her young man
will take up

752
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,739
every scrap of attention we have for
weddings.

753
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,219
Please don't say that.
Papa!

754
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,739
Larry's been in the car since he
left the dining room.

755
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,379
I'm just coming. I'll say good
night, Mrs Crawley.

756
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,380
Good night.

757
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,019
Don't blame Larry. He was close to
his mother

758
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,779
and hates the thought
of a replacement. They both do.

759
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,859
You don't need to remind me.

760
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,020
The boys take after their mother in
every possible way.

761
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,059
I'm going to sleep in the dressing
room tonight.

762
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,660
I'm not cross. I just want to have
her with me.

763
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,739
Stay here.

764
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,739
The thing is, I'm pretty sure she
won't last till morning

765
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,740
and I don't want her to be
frightened.

766
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,139
Then lay her here between us.

767
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,500
And she'll know she has someone who
loves her very much next to her.

768
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,420
Two people who love her and each
other very much on either side.

769
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,180
I only hope I can say the same when
my time comes.

770
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,019
Love may not conquer all but it can
conquer quite a lot.

771
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,139
Mummy, Daddy, can you try to behave like
a happy couple? Wouldn't that be dishonest?

772
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,459
I could get a job in London, I know
I could. I'm sure you could.

773
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,760
We have our memories, you and I.

774
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:16,328
I feel as if our household is
breaking up, Carson.

775
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:20,009
He's trying to bully it out but it's
best not to stand in his way.

776
00:47:20,034 --> 00:47:23,520

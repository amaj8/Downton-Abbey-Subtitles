2
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:08,948
Are you taking it out? Oh...

3
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:17,748
Look at this. A man in misery.

4
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,292
Who's in misery?
The King, according to Robert.

5
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:24,171
Why? He has to deal with a Labour
government. Why do you think?

6
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:27,049
He doesn't look miserable to me.
He just looks like himself.

7
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:31,595
What is your objection to Mr MacDonald? That
the Prime Minister is the son of a crofter?

8
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:34,974
I couldn't care less if he was
the son of Fu Manchu.

9
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:37,476
What worries me is that our
government is committed

10
00:01:37,518 --> 00:01:40,604
to the destruction of people like us
and everything we stand for.

11
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:43,315
Well, let's wait and see what
happens before we panic.

12
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:47,319
Where's Edith? She had some old lady
to see in the village.

13
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:51,073
What about you? Is everything
settled at the school? What's this?

14
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:55,077
They swore in Mr Adams' replacement on
the school board. It all went off smoothly.

15
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,330
I thought they might have asked me.
I feel guilty about the school.

16
00:01:58,372 --> 00:01:59,957
I ought to support it more.

17
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,751
Well, I'm giving away the prizes
this year. Come with me.

18
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:04,545
Barrow, can we clear the tea?

19
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:07,298
Lady Edith's missed it, and Nanny
will be down shortly.

20
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,509
I'd better run.
Oh, stay and see them.

21
00:02:10,551 --> 00:02:13,304
Just as soon as they're able to
answer back.

22
00:02:13,345 --> 00:02:16,390
Sybbie CAN answer back.
True. Why does she call me Donk?

23
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:19,059
That game you played - pinning the
tail on the donkey.

24
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:21,645
Can't I be Grandpapa or something
dignified?

25
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,689
I'm afraid it's Donk for the moment.

26
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,567
I don't want George to catch it.
Here they are.

27
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,237
Here's your grandfather now.
Bye-bye, darlings. Goodbye, Donk.

28
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:36,619
George, come and sit here, darling.

29
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:42,791
Put it there and I'll see to it.
Oh, don't be like that.

30
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,460
Ena can manage.

31
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:49,924
Why should she, any more than me?
We've no proper kitchen maid now, so
we must all muck in.

32
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:54,136
What's the matter? Daisy's grumbling
because they didn't replace Ivy.

33
00:02:54,178 --> 00:03:00,559
At Skelton Park, they're down to a
butler, a cook, two maids and a
cleaning woman, and that's it.

34
00:03:00,601 --> 00:03:03,062
How on earth does it work?
I couldn't tell you.

35
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:05,356
Why have the people left?

36
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:10,319
They prefer to be in factories or
shops. They like the hours better.

37
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:12,738
Oh... I'll forget my head next.

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,284
I came in to remind you it's their
34th wedding anniversary on Saturday week,

39
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:20,079
so, if you want to do a cake, this
is an advance warning.

40
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,208
I suppose there'll be a dinner of
some sort. Oh, I don't know.

41
00:03:24,249 --> 00:03:30,089
34 years! If I were to marry this
year, what would life be like in 1958?

42
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,840
I doubt I'll be troubled by it.

43
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:33,884
Do you think we'll leave service?

44
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:38,389
Well, you'll be fine. You've got Mr
Mason's farm to go to. What about me?

45
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,185
But could I? What do I know about farming
or ordering supplies or doing accounts?

46
00:03:43,227 --> 00:03:45,354
Suppose I can't tackle a new life.

47
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:48,274
If it's all right with you, I've to
tackle tonight's dinner.

48
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,735
Now, start the salmon pates,
while I do a lemon mayonnaise.

49
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:03,747
We had good news today. Tim was asked
to be chief of the estate firemen.

50
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,376
Oh, how nice. Many congratulations.

51
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:13,507
Can I give you some more tea?
No, thank you.

52
00:04:14,758 --> 00:04:18,762
How about you, Marigold? Are you
quite finished?

53
00:04:18,804 --> 00:04:23,142
I just love to see her gurgling
away, so peaceful and happy.

54
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:26,937
We've almost forgotten she's not one
of our own, haven't we, Tim?

55
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,316
She's just lovely. How pretty your
hair is, darling.

56
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:34,236
I do wonder where she got her
colouring, but I never knew her parents.

57
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,155
No?
No.

58
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:40,075
Her mother was an old friend of
Tim's, but I never met either of them.

59
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:44,663
Oh, is that the time? We mustn't
hold you up.

60
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:52,129
Good girl.

61
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:56,008
Good girl.

62
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,888
I should probably go.
Have you got your teddy?

63
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,015
Say goodbye.

64
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,855
Goodbye.

65
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:15,277
Thank you for... Thank you.

66
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:25,079
She's got a soft spot for you.

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,206
Don't be daft.

68
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:36,215
I do love this evening light.

69
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:38,342
Oh, I must tell Lord Merton.

70
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:43,806
Tease me if you will, but I don't
want to be pursued by him or Lord anyone.

71
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,892
Well, that's a pity - he's asked me
to help him in his courtship.

72
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,144
What?
He doesn't want to pester you,

73
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:52,606
so he's asked if I could give another
luncheon party.

74
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,775
Oh, dear.
Oh, why the lamentation?

75
00:05:54,817 --> 00:05:56,819
You don't have to see him.

76
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,570
Well, you make it sound so easy.

77
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:02,408
There's nothing simpler than avoiding
people you don't like.

78
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,494
Avoiding one's friends - that's the
real test.

79
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:08,372
But I do like him.
I think he's very nice.

80
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:11,500
It's just, he wants something from
me that I cannot give.

81
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:13,502
He just wants what all men want.

82
00:06:13,544 --> 00:06:15,629
Oh, don't be ridiculous!

83
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,133
I was referring to companionship.

84
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:22,511
As I hope you were.

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,644
Oh, I didn't mean to disturb you.

86
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:34,064
I'm sorry. It's a letter from Lady
Anstruther again.

87
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:36,317
Blimey. She doesn't give up easily.

88
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:39,028
Well, you know me.
'Irresistible' is my middle name.

89
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:42,323
Well, was she like this when you
were working for her? Not as bad.

90
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,908
She had to be more discreet with the
other servants.

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,037
Hadn't you better go up to London
and put her out of her misery?

92
00:06:48,078 --> 00:06:49,580
Oh, don't tempt me...

93
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,916
because I know this: If I weaken,
I'll pay for it.

94
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:57,338
This sounds very like the kind of
boys' talk I do not allow.

95
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,301
If you can both tear yourselves away
from your smutty deliberations,

96
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:04,428
I need you both upstairs.

97
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,517
Where is she?
I hope I'm not late.

98
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:13,103
No, Carson hasn't come in yet.
That reminds me.

99
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:16,941
We're to receive a village delegation
tomorrow. I ran into the Postmistress.

100
00:07:16,982 --> 00:07:19,068
She asked if they might pay us a
visit.

101
00:07:19,109 --> 00:07:21,862
Mrs Wigan?
What was it that reminded you?

102
00:07:21,904 --> 00:07:25,699
She asked for Carson to be present.
Why? What's it about?

103
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:28,994
They want to erect some kind of
memorial to the war. What?

104
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:32,289
Well, not to the war, but to the men,
the local men, who died in it.

105
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,626
They'll be all over the country.
I suppose they want me as chairman.

106
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,378
Who was it?
Tony Gillingham.

107
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,214
He had some business up here, and
you told him he could stay.

108
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:43,509
When does he want to come?
That's the problem. The 16th.

109
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,303
And...?
It's our anniversary.

110
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:48,722
Oh, that doesn't matter.
Ring him and say yes.

111
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:51,308
We don't have to.
No. I'd like to see him.

112
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,727
Right. That's dinner, everyone.

113
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,730
You don't mind Tony coming, do you?
Not if it's what you want.

114
00:07:56,772 --> 00:08:01,860
I'll tell you what I want.
I want to inspire Tony Gillingham
with thoughts of marriage.

115
00:08:05,447 --> 00:08:08,993
So, does that mean Lord Gillingham
wins and Mr Blake can go whistle?

116
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:13,664
I'm glad for them. Viscountess
Gillingham - it sounds quite smart.

117
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:16,709
I think they'll be happy, and it'll
be good for Master George.

118
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,462
It's a big thing, to take on the
task of raising another man's son.

119
00:08:20,504 --> 00:08:24,300
There's nothing to worry about
there. His Lordship's a kind man.

120
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:27,803
I wish you'd tell me what you know
about those two.

121
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,097
I don't know anything.

122
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,934
What you suspect, then. And don't
deny it, because I've seen you.

123
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:37,021
You can't stop looking at them when
you think no-one's looking.

124
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:39,356
Can I join in?
Do you have to?

125
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,568
How was it in York? Did you find
what you were looking for?

126
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,697
I did. Took a bit of a search,
but I think I'm suited.

127
00:08:46,739 --> 00:08:50,034
What's that, then?
Oh, just something.

128
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,870
A group's arriving from the village
tomorrow morning.

129
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,415
Can you get one of the footmen to
bring coffee and something to eat at 11?

130
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:59,668
Well, find me when you want it.
I can't. I'm in the meeting myself.

131
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,587
That's why I'm telling you now.

132
00:09:01,629 --> 00:09:05,341
What's it for? I don't know, but His
Lordship asked me to be there.

133
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:07,134
Well, I think it's fantastic.

134
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:11,055
When did we last have a Prime Minister
who understood the working class? Never.

135
00:09:11,096 --> 00:09:14,683
It's a qualification that is
meaningless in terms of government.

136
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:17,937
I'm not sure I can agree with you
there. I think it's important.

137
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:21,857
Me too. Mr MacDonald will have real
experience of a hard life.

138
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,776
He knows what most people go
through.

139
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:27,446
Up the workers.
So, James is a revolutionary now!

140
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:31,992
He's not a revolutionary. He believes in justice
for the majority. What's wrong with that?

141
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:35,204
Nothing, but I suppose he can fight
his own battles.

142
00:09:35,245 --> 00:09:39,249
We'll have no fighting here,
thank you very much.

143
00:09:41,043 --> 00:09:44,129
You wouldn't mind heading
the war-memorial appeal, would you?

144
00:09:44,171 --> 00:09:48,676
I feel a bit embarrassed. I wasn't wounded.
I wasn't even allowed to fight.

145
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:53,138
They should ask a man like General
McKee or Johnnie Raymond. Someone who
did their bit.

146
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,977
You're their traditional leader and
they like you to pray with them, in
mourning and in gratitude.

147
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:02,273
But I should be praying in the back
row, not the front. That's all.

148
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:13,701
Please don't think us too forward.
You have no need to worry.

149
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:15,536
I'm happy to play my part.

150
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:19,081
But we don't know yet where we want
the memorial to be, m'lord. So...?

151
00:10:19,123 --> 00:10:24,253
Well, if you're to give us a piece of land, you'd
better know where it is before you agree.

152
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,839
I'm sure I will agree, but is that
why you're here?

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,633
To ask for a piece of land as the
site for this thing?

154
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,885
That's why we're here to see you,
m'lord.

155
00:10:31,927 --> 00:10:35,306
But we'd also like to offer the
position of Chairman of our Committee -

156
00:10:35,347 --> 00:10:39,143
I'll take over now.
You were saying...?

157
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:42,187
We'd like Mr Carson to be Chairman
of our Committee.

158
00:10:42,688 --> 00:10:46,150
But surely, His Lordship...?

159
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:48,569
No, Carson.
They don't want me - they want you.

160
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,487
I wouldn't put it like that, m'lord,

161
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,991
but Mr Carson knew more of the young
men that died than you did.

162
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,785
Yes, I suppose you're right.
Well, he knew them better.

163
00:10:56,827 --> 00:11:00,831
That's it. And he's a considerable
figure in the village.

164
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:02,958
Tea, please.

165
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,923
Carson? What do you say?
I am honoured by the invitation,

166
00:11:08,964 --> 00:11:10,966
but I shall have to think about it.

167
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:14,136
Of course you will.
But please don't take too long.

168
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:16,764
Can you put my milk in first,
if that's for me?

169
00:11:23,854 --> 00:11:27,107
Did that come in the second post?
It did.

170
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:29,234
From Lady Anstruther.

171
00:11:30,194 --> 00:11:32,321
Not again? What's stoked her up?

172
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:34,823
My fault. I shouldn't have sent her
the Valentine.

173
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:38,035
Yes, but that was -
And I sent her another this year.

174
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:41,664
How did she know they were from you?
Because I bloody signed them. Oh!

175
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:45,250
I don't know what I was thinking.
It was supposed to be a joke.

176
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,127
But, well, now it's got out of hand.

177
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,504
Don't worry.

178
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:52,716
One day I'll be a good boy and
settle down. We all settle down one day.

179
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:54,843
We don't all have the option.

180
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:01,058
Heavens! I wasn't expecting you.

181
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,646
I've been to see Smithers at Oak
Field Farm. I just thought I'd look
in on my way home.

182
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,773
I'm glad you did.

183
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,067
I had a delegation from the village,

184
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,486
about the new war memorial
they're putting up.

185
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:15,030
Oh, they want you to head it?
No.

186
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,408
They've invited Carson to be the
Chairman.

187
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:21,328
Well, why not you?
The village wanted Carson.

188
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,207
Your father always told the village
what they wanted.

189
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,625
Hmm.

190
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,295
Is it true old Dicky Merton
is paying court to Isobel?

191
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:31,714
Isn't it absurd?

192
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:36,343
Oh, it might be rather fun for her to reinvent
herself as a great lady of the county

193
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:38,470
and put us all in our proper place.

194
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,598
Yes, I suppose it would be fun.

195
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,766
But you don't think she's keen?

196
00:12:42,808 --> 00:12:48,272
Oh, no, far from it. She never tires
of telling me.

197
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,303
Daisy, this came for you in the
post.

198
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,597
Thank you, Mr Carson.
Oh, what is it?

199
00:12:56,765 --> 00:12:58,808
Something I ordered.

200
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:01,853
May we know what, O Queen?
Something I need.

201
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:03,939
Why must it be a secret?

202
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,609
Well, it would be a bit sad if she
had no secrets at her age.

203
00:13:09,945 --> 00:13:12,614
Have you made your decision about
the memorial?

204
00:13:12,656 --> 00:13:14,991
Oh, not yet.

205
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:19,371
I'm not comfortable being placed
ahead of His Lordship.

206
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:22,874
You should have seen his face,
Mrs Hughes. He felt very let down.

207
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,585
It's the Committee's choice,
and they've chosen you.

208
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:30,423
And the country's chosen a Labour government,
so people don't always get it right.

209
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,343
What are you afraid of?

210
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:37,347
I feel a shaking of the ground
I stand on.

211
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:42,060
That everything I believe in will be
tested and held up for ridicule
over the next few years.

212
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:46,273
Mr Carson, they've been testing the
system since the Romans left.

213
00:13:46,314 --> 00:13:48,149
Oh, I suppose that's true.

214
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:52,821
The nature of life is not permanence
but flux.

215
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:55,198
Just so...

216
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,826
even if it does sound faintly
disgusting.

217
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:14,217
There you are, m'lady.
Madge said you were going out.

218
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,761
We were giving a turn-out to the
blue room,

219
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:19,598
and this had been put on the shelf
with the other books.

220
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:24,769
What is it? A German primer, but the
point is, it's not ours.

221
00:14:24,811 --> 00:14:30,692
Mr Gregson's written his name
in the fly-leaf. I see.

222
00:14:30,734 --> 00:14:34,321
I nearly gave it to Her Ladyship,
but it seemed more suitable -

223
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,282
No. I'm the one who should have it.

224
00:14:41,077 --> 00:14:43,955
Can you please put it on the table
beside my bed?

225
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:46,082
Of course.
Thank you.

226
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:50,045
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon. Thank you, Molesley.

227
00:14:50,086 --> 00:14:52,339
It's good of you to come with us.

228
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,507
I must have something to do.

229
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:57,260
Where's your mother?
In the library.

230
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,476
I'm not sure Tom's visiting the
school is such a good idea.

231
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:08,813
He made a friend there of one of the
schoolmistresses when we were in London.

232
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,690
What's wrong with that?

233
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:15,820
I don't intend to explain, but I was
rather disappointed in him.
I would have hoped for better.

234
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,782
You're being very mysterious.
Can't I know the details?

235
00:15:18,823 --> 00:15:20,909
You really don't need to.

236
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:24,120
There you are. How were they?

237
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:26,831
As dull as ever. They sent love.

238
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:29,209
What was the meeting like?
Have you accepted?

239
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:33,505
It wasn't me they came to see.
Well, they want me to give them some
land for the thing,

240
00:15:33,547 --> 00:15:35,674
but they asked Carson to be the
Chairman.

241
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:38,134
Carson? Well, how nice.

242
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,514
I'm going upstairs to take off
my hat.

243
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:45,559
Well, she's pleased, anyway.

244
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,105
Congratulations.

245
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:58,989
I'm sure you will want me to thank
Lady Rose for consenting to present
the prizes today.

246
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,616
We're always glad of interest from
the Abbey.

247
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:04,119
And finally, thank you all for
coming.

248
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,246
It is most appreciated.

249
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:23,847
I'm glad Peter won a prize for
Geography. Well done, him.

250
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,974
He didn't get that from his father.

251
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:30,812
Is Mrs Drewe with you? No, she's at
home, looking after the young 'uns.

252
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:33,732
We ought to talk, but not here.

253
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,902
Tomorrow. At 11. By the stone barn.

254
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:44,659
You've been away.
I've been on a course.

255
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:48,038
I nearly wrote to tell you, but
I thought it might be presumptuous.

256
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,917
Well, I'm pleased to see you back.
That's a relief.

257
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:56,296
I thought I must have earned a black mark, making
you take me up to the house that night.

258
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,758
Hello, Miss Bunting.
Lady Rose. Well done.

259
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,137
Oh, it's not exactly difficult - giving out prizes.
I think we get thanked too much.

260
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:06,097
But that's the custom, isn't it?

261
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:08,808
We ought to head off, if we're to be
back before the gong.

262
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,437
The Rule of the Gong. It sounds like
life in a religious order!

263
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:15,899
Goodbye.

264
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:18,735
I'll see you again.
I hope so.

265
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,494
Spratt...

266
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,747
Offer Dr Clarkson some cake.
Then you may go.

267
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:37,712
Thank you.

268
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:43,468
I'm afraid serving me is a bit
beneath his dignity.

269
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,139
Even Spratt cannot always
live for pleasure.

270
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:51,977
how well do you know
Lord Merton?

271
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:53,895
Erm... I don't, really.

272
00:17:53,937 --> 00:17:55,188
Oh.

273
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,235
Because I thought you might be
amused by how friendly he and Mrs
Crawley have become.

274
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,656
What Mrs Crawley chooses to do with
her private life is her own affair.

275
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,701
Oh, dear. I've annoyed you.

276
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:09,828
No, no, no, I'm not annoyed...

277
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:13,707
..although I am surprised to learn
that she entertains notions

278
00:18:13,748 --> 00:18:16,418
of passing her time at drawing-room
receptions

279
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,670
and taking carriage rides in the
park.

280
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:23,383
Well, no-one takes carriage rides in
the park any more.

281
00:18:23,425 --> 00:18:25,844
That's quite gone.

282
00:18:25,886 --> 00:18:28,013
I wouldn't know.

283
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:31,892
You ought to meet Lord Merton
properly.

284
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:35,353
Come to luncheon on Saturday.

285
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:37,522
Mrs Crawley will be here
and so will he.

286
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:40,400
Well, that's quite an honour,
Lady Grantham. Are you sure?

287
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:45,155
Oh, it'll be fun. I'm hoping to
persuade dear Lady Shackleton

288
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:47,282
to be one of our number.

289
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:56,625
Mama's gone to bed. She wanted an
early night. I might go up too.

290
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,752
Come and sit here for a minute.

291
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:06,718
It doesn't really bother you they
want Carson, does it?

292
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,845
They'd be lucky to get him.

293
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:11,890
Even so, it makes you think.

294
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:15,185
Would a village delegation have
arrived in my grandfather's day

295
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:18,188
to ask his butler to head an appeal?

296
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,150
We're not living in your
grandfather's day. No, we are not.

297
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:26,529
So, they don't want me at the school
and they don't want me for the memorial.

298
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,657
Well, I want you.

299
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:31,952
I think you, Tom and I make a pretty
good team.

300
00:19:35,497 --> 00:19:38,833
By the way, I've been looking into
crop rotation and grain sales -

301
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:41,795
And not every father hears that from
his daughter.

302
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:48,677
Mr Barrow...

303
00:19:49,886 --> 00:19:51,888
I'm tired of waiting, Miss Baxter.

304
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,015
I'm tired of being bullied.

305
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:01,856
I got you this job and you knew what
I wanted in return.

306
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:04,859
So don't complain about it now.

307
00:20:11,157 --> 00:20:13,243
Thank you, Madge. Good night.

308
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,886
Did you know Dicky Merton was in hot
pursuit of Isobel?

309
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:33,555
Mama says she's desperate to throw
him off.

310
00:20:33,597 --> 00:20:36,057
I wonder.
What do you mean?

311
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:40,812
I don't believe your mother would enjoy the
transformation of Isobel into Lady Merton,

312
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:44,900
complete with a living husband, a proper
house and a solid position in the county.

313
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,943
That would not suit Mama at all.

314
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:51,364
Oh, don't be ridiculous. She'd be
thrilled, if that was what Isobel wanted.

315
00:20:56,453 --> 00:21:00,832
Daisy, whatever are you doing up at this
hour? I thought you'd gone to bed long ago.

316
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:03,335
I just wanted to look at these.

317
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,462
What is it?

318
00:21:05,587 --> 00:21:07,672
You can tell me.

319
00:21:08,048 --> 00:21:12,260
Arithmetic Part 1?
Cost Accounting? What is this?

320
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:14,221
I was rubbish at numbers at school.

321
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:17,182
Well, all the best people were
rubbish at numbers at school.

322
00:21:17,224 --> 00:21:22,229
But I don't know anything.
You talk about my working at
Mr Mason's farm, but how?

323
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,981
I couldn't balance the books if my
life depended on it.

324
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:29,319
Why do you need to? Because I want
to be grown up, Mrs Patmore.

325
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:32,155
I want responsibility.
I want to be an adult.

326
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:35,659
I can't just stand here, following
orders, for the rest of my life.

327
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,160
Well, I do see that.

328
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:40,080
The trouble is, I'm too stupid to
make out one solitary word.

329
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:42,999
You're not stupid, Daisy.
Far from it.

330
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,878
Then why can't I understand what's
written? Why can't I follow it?

331
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:49,756
Because...

332
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:52,175
Because I'm a pig-ignorant idiot.

333
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:54,302
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

334
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:31,548
Is this your secret lair?

335
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,009
It's not very secret,
but this is where I work.

336
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,387
And where you can hide away from the
rest of us?

337
00:22:39,055 --> 00:22:41,933
Why do you never ask that
Miss Bunting up to the house?

338
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,852
Maybe I will. One day.

339
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,522
You live there too, you know.
I'm not sure where I live.

340
00:22:47,564 --> 00:22:49,733
I feel sometimes I'm hanging in
mid-air.

341
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:52,819
Well, you mustn't think we don't
want you to have your own life.

342
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,238
I don't think that of Mary or Edith
or you.

343
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,574
But it would be hard for Lord and
Lady Grantham.

344
00:22:57,616 --> 00:23:00,827
They'd have to get used to it.
Easier said than done.

345
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:02,954
I'd better get on.

346
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,755
So, I have your permission to
accept?

347
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:14,633
You don't need it.
It has nothing to do with your work.

348
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:17,969
No, but I wouldn't want to think it
was disagreeable for you.

349
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:20,305
We'd be delighted, Carson.

350
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,767
You'll be able to steer it through
the perils of village politics.

351
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:27,896
But traditionally, I feel it should
have been you, m'lord.

352
00:23:27,938 --> 00:23:30,023
Maybe this will be a new tradition.

353
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:38,240
I know you hate not to be wanted,
but you're on so many committees.

354
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,326
What do you mean,
I hate not being wanted?

355
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:52,545
You think I'm taking too much
of an interest in Marigold.

356
00:23:52,587 --> 00:23:55,131
It's Margie.
She thinks I'm there too often.

357
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:57,926
Because you've got a crush on me.

358
00:23:57,968 --> 00:24:00,554
Well, that's better than the real
reason...

359
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:07,561
The real reason is a good reason to
love a child, m'lady.

360
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:11,022
Mothers should love their children.

361
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:16,319
How long have you known?
Since you asked me to take her in.

362
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:19,739
But you're quite safe.

363
00:24:19,781 --> 00:24:22,909
It's not my place to judge you, and I
wouldn't, anyway.

364
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:26,246
But I should control my feelings?

365
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:29,207
I could say yes, but I don't believe
it's realistic.

366
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:31,334
I don't believe you could.

367
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:33,878
Then what are you saying?

368
00:24:34,504 --> 00:24:38,675
We need a way for you to live the
truth, without telling the truth.

369
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:47,335
The die is cast. I've accepted.

370
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:49,339
His Lordship told me to take it.

371
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,008
There you are, then.
But he was sad.

372
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,303
Not with me, but maybe because
things are changing.

373
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:59,099
Well, they are,
whether we're sad about it or not.

374
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:03,895
I hope you're right about
Lord Gillingham.

375
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:06,689
What would I have felt if I'd
inherited a family with you?

376
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:08,733
You'd have loved them, I hope.
I would,

377
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:14,114
but I can't deny I'd prefer one of my
own. You'd feel the same.

378
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:17,659
Well, they do say a mother's love is
the strongest love there is.

379
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,620
But that's all in God's hands.
There's nothing we can do.

380
00:25:20,662 --> 00:25:25,291
I can think of one thing. Mr Bates,
that sort of talk is beneath you.

381
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:27,418
I stand corrected.

382
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:33,091
I'll have it out of you. Fancy a
breath of air before the gong?

383
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,218
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

384
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:40,140
What's the matter with you? You've
not said a word all afternoon.

385
00:25:40,181 --> 00:25:43,810
I went to the village and telephoned
her, to reason with her,

386
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,937
and I think it were a mistake.

387
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,064
It was never going to put her off.

388
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,191
Exactly.

389
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:53,361
The trouble is, she hates getting
older,

390
00:25:53,403 --> 00:25:55,321
and I think that's at the bottom of
it.

391
00:25:55,363 --> 00:25:59,075
Still, it's pathetic for a lady to
be pining over a footman.

392
00:25:59,117 --> 00:26:00,994
Excuse me!

393
00:26:01,035 --> 00:26:03,121
I think it shows very good taste.

394
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:09,210
My dear Lady Shackleton, how kind.
And you're on your way somewhere?

395
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:12,380
I am and I can't stay.
I'm dining with Philip,

396
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:15,175
and his wife sulks all night if
you're a minute late.

397
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:19,471
You should write a book:
Daughters-In-Law And How To Survive Them.

398
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:22,515
I like yours.
Yes, Cora does very well,

399
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:25,894
even if one cannot always rely on
her instincts.

400
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:28,396
I'd exchange her for mine in a trice.

401
00:26:28,438 --> 00:26:32,650
Tell me: how well do you know
Lord Merton?

402
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:37,238
Oh, you know. We've seen each other
at parties for 40 years.

403
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,951
I worry that he's finding things
difficult since his wife died.

404
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:44,537
You're a widow.
You know what he's going through.

405
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,624
I suppose so, but I never saw them
as very devoted.

406
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:50,794
I should have thought he was glad to
be rid of her. I would be.

407
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:54,005
Then his sons are quite difficult.

408
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:56,091
I know what that's like.

409
00:26:56,132 --> 00:27:01,679
Could you come to luncheon on
Saturday? Help me cheer him up?

410
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,515
Well, I'd love to.
Oh!

411
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,684
Of course, a single peer with a good
estate won't be lonely long,

412
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,812
if he doesn't want to be.

413
00:27:08,853 --> 00:27:11,314
You sound like Mrs Bennett!

414
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:17,779
But what's he on about? He thinks
I know something about Mr Bates.

415
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,073
And do you?
Maybe.

416
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:22,826
Mr Bates may have done something he
wouldn't want known.

417
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,744
Do you mean a crime or...?

418
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:28,581
I'm not sure. I know he took a
journey, which I think he'd deny.

419
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,792
Look, I don't want to know any
more...

420
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:35,255
..but a pound to a penny,

421
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,049
Mr Barrow thinks he can use it
against Mr Bates.

422
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:42,846
Report him to Her Ladyship.
She'd soon put a stop to it.

423
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,973
I can't.

424
00:27:46,182 --> 00:27:48,268
It's complicated, but I can't.

425
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,231
What is it?

426
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:57,360
What's what? You're doing something
funny with your head.

427
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,737
Sort of... tilting it.

428
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,283
I'm not, am I?
How do you think I look?

429
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:05,660
Why? Have you got a rash?

430
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,496
No, I've not got a rash.

431
00:28:08,538 --> 00:28:11,332
That's all right, then.
No, what I meant was...

432
00:28:14,836 --> 00:28:17,338
How old would you say I am?

433
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,591
I don't know. Maybe... 52?

434
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,220
Oh.
Why? How old are you?

435
00:28:24,888 --> 00:28:26,973
51.

436
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:30,977
I've just had the strangest
telephone call.

437
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,563
Oh?
Do you remember Lady Anstruther?

438
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:35,940
You mean Jock Anstruther's widow?
That's it.

439
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:39,027
Her sister's Lady Renton and
her brother's Harry Mountevans.

440
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:42,614
I do remember her. Good-looking and
half Jock's age, and rather silly.

441
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:46,367
Well, silly or not, she's just rung
up and asked herself for tea. Oh.

442
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:49,329
Do people think we're a public house
on the Great North Road?

443
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,414
It certainly seems like it.

444
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:55,126
She's driving through the village on
Saturday and would love to see us.

445
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,962
What did you say?
Well, it's only tea.

446
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,465
Are we doing anything for your
anniversary?

447
00:29:00,507 --> 00:29:03,218
What had you in mind?
Well, now that Tony's staying,

448
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:06,471
I thought we could invite some
people, make an evening of it.

449
00:29:06,513 --> 00:29:08,848
Well, you girls ask some friends.

450
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,310
I'd like a young party for once,
instead of all those old duffers.

451
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,020
Hello.

452
00:29:14,062 --> 00:29:16,272
Oh, Mary, I've got an idea.

453
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:24,614
I think it's sharp of Daisy to want
to learn to manage figures.

454
00:29:24,656 --> 00:29:26,908
I'm afraid I agree with Mrs Patmore.

455
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,369
Why does she need to? She's a cook.

456
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,371
Cooks have to balance their budget.

457
00:29:31,412 --> 00:29:34,874
She can learn enough for that
without being an expert in algebra.

458
00:29:34,916 --> 00:29:36,709
She may not always be a cook.

459
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:39,629
Possibly not, but she won't be
Archimedes, either.

460
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,006
Sorry, but I don't think we should
encourage it.

461
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:47,512
I'm going up. I want to read a bit
before I turn out the light.

462
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:49,681
Oh, well done with your studies,
Daisy.

463
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:52,434
It's good to have more than one
string to your bow.

464
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:56,354
It's even better if you don't have
the brain of a kipper. Good night.

465
00:29:56,771 --> 00:30:00,525
See? What did I tell you? She's lost
her confidence because of it.

466
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:03,695
And no mathematical skill
is worth that.

467
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:09,284
Why must Lady Anstruther choose
Saturday, of all days?

468
00:30:09,325 --> 00:30:11,161
Ought we to invite her to
the dinner?

469
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,413
Isn't she staying somewhere else?

470
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:16,708
Tell me tomorrow who's coming, of
your pals. Keep the numbers even.

471
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:20,378
Well, Rose wants to invite a friend
of Tom's. He must feel so outnumbered.

472
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,132
Not that brother, I hope.
Someone local. Rose has met her.

473
00:30:24,174 --> 00:30:26,259
So have I. She's quite respectable.

474
00:30:26,301 --> 00:30:28,386
I think it would be nice.

475
00:30:33,516 --> 00:30:35,727
Looking forward to seeing
Lord Gillingham?

476
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:39,230
I only saw him in London last week,
so I can remember what he looks like.

477
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:42,150
But I expect it's difficult to get
time alone in London.

478
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:44,068
Less difficult than when
I was a girl.

479
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,780
But yes, it'll be good to see him
here.

480
00:30:48,114 --> 00:30:51,701
I haven't made up my mind, if that's
what you're thinking.

481
00:30:51,743 --> 00:30:55,914
I wasn't thinking anything, but I
suppose you'll have to some time.

482
00:30:57,457 --> 00:31:01,753
The older I get, the more I feel we
do these things very oddly.

483
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,882
Even now we must decide whether to
share our lives with someone

484
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:09,094
without ever spending any real time
with them.

485
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,930
Let alone... you know.

486
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:16,142
Of course, these days, some women do.

487
00:31:16,184 --> 00:31:18,645
I was talking to Lady Cunard's
daughter last week,

488
00:31:18,686 --> 00:31:21,064
and she was so graphic,
I almost fainted.

489
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,944
But then, what could be more
important?

490
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:29,405
To make sure that that side of things
is right...

491
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,284
..before we tie ourselves to someone
for ever?

492
00:31:33,326 --> 00:31:36,246
I'm afraid I'm too old-fashioned
for you, m'lady.

493
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:39,624
I need hardly say you're not to
repeat a word to Bates.

494
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,751
Of course not, m'lady.

495
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,842
What do you make of this?

496
00:31:48,883 --> 00:31:50,885
Blimey. What does that mean?

497
00:31:50,927 --> 00:31:55,682
As you know, Lord Gillingham arrives today,
but there's been no mention of a valet.

498
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:59,602
There was enough mention of the last
one. Poor Mr Green. A terrible end.

499
00:31:59,644 --> 00:32:01,771
Let's not rake over that now.

500
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:06,025
As I say, His Lordship may have a valet,
but these days we can't be sure, so...

501
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,819
Yes, Mr Carson?

502
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:11,739
Not you. Mr Bates, would you keep
an eye on him, if necessary?

503
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:13,575
Certainly, Mr Carson.

504
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:16,911
Mr Molesley, have you...?
Have I what, Mr Carson?

505
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:21,207
Er... never mind.

506
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:28,715
Arms down. Relax.

507
00:32:28,757 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm sorry. They've only just told me
you were waiting.

508
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:33,887
Oh, I've not been here long.

509
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:36,723
I wanted to see you after I read
your letter.

510
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:39,100
It wasn't meant to be confusing.

511
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:41,227
No. But why won't you come?

512
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:45,774
Because I don't want to be part of
some sort of a... prank.

513
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:47,817
What prank?

514
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:51,237
I may not have been presented at
Court, Lady Rose,

515
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,450
but I do know it's usual to be
invited to dinner by the hostess.

516
00:32:55,492 --> 00:32:57,911
And shouldn't Mr Branson have played
a part in it?

517
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:02,373
Lady Grantham asked us to invite some
younger guests to liven up the evening,

518
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:06,252
so Mary and I thought it would be nice
for Tom to have a friend there. That's all.

519
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:09,464
I'm right, then? He doesn't know.

520
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:13,718
No, it would be a surprise for him,
but a nice surprise.

521
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,221
And Lady Grantham is aware of this?

522
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:18,765
Completely. She wants you to come.

523
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:25,146
I could have managed Lord Gillingham.
No need to burden Mr Bates with him.

524
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:28,358
I think Mr Carson forgets that
I'm a valet, too.

525
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,237
I know, and it seems a bit ironic
for Mr Bates to dress him.

526
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:35,657
Why is it ironic?
I don't know why I said that.

527
00:33:35,698 --> 00:33:37,784
Why did you say it, Miss Baxter?

528
00:33:40,036 --> 00:33:41,871
Er... it was rubbish. Nonsense.

529
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:44,624
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late.

530
00:33:55,927 --> 00:34:00,348
Oh, how nice. I wanted to call on
you, but I didn't like to be a bother.

531
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,768
I've been quite busy lately, helping
with the out-patient clinic.

532
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,438
Dr Clarkson.
Oh. Lady Grantham.

533
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:09,566
May I present Dr Clarkson?
I think you know Lord Merton.

534
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:12,235
I think we have met, yes.

535
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:15,280
We were talking about your clinic.
Oh, you mustn't bore him.

536
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:18,324
As a matter of fact, I'd be
interested to - The Lady Shackleton.

537
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:20,618
Oh, my dear, how prompt you are.

538
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,455
Your daughter-in-law has trained you
well.

539
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,707
Now, you remember Lord Merton?

540
00:34:25,748 --> 00:34:28,126
Of course. How are you?

541
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:30,170
And how's that lovely garden of
yours?

542
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:34,632
Oh, still lovely. Largely because
I have the same lovely gardener.

543
00:34:34,674 --> 00:34:37,635
I don't think we've met since dear
Lady Merton's funeral.

544
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:40,263
I do hope things are sorting
themselves out.

545
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:45,560
You've gone to a lot of trouble.
Mmm. I like to help where I can.

546
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,023
Oh, Spratt. Shall we go in?

547
00:34:51,983 --> 00:34:54,319
Lord Gillingham.
Ah, here he is.

548
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,072
Tony, welcome.
Lovely to see you all.

549
00:34:58,114 --> 00:35:00,867
I'm afraid you've missed luncheon.
I ate on the train.

550
00:35:00,909 --> 00:35:03,536
A cup of coffee, then?
That would be perfect.

551
00:35:04,954 --> 00:35:07,332
Carson, I must congratulate you.

552
00:35:07,373 --> 00:35:10,835
They're building a memorial in the
village, and Carson is the Chairman.

553
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:15,465
I like the idea of these things.
To give people a solid focus for
their grief and gratitude.

554
00:35:15,507 --> 00:35:20,095
I agree, My Lord. I hope
His Lordship's happy about it.

555
00:35:20,136 --> 00:35:21,846
My being Chairman, I mean.

556
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:25,058
He is. Or, at any rate, he will be.

557
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,977
So, how are the famous pigs doing?
Pretty well.

558
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:30,188
They're earning their keep and more.

559
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,067
I'm going out this afternoon, to get
some rabbits for Mrs Patmore. Come with me.

560
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,694
I'll find you a gun and you can see
what we've been up to.

561
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:40,448
I'll come too, although I warn you -
I'm not very good at picking up.

562
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,118
Well, if I'm shooting,
you won't have to.

563
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,245
That I do not believe.

564
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:54,963
Could you spare me for an hour?
I think everything's under control.

565
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:59,426
I just want to run down to the post
office. I won't be long.

566
00:36:00,802 --> 00:36:04,389
So, will you be travelling north in
August for the grouse?

567
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:07,892
You talk as if my sole concern is
the sporting year, Dr Clarkson.

568
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:11,146
The truth is, these days, I hold a
book more often than a 12-bore.

569
00:36:11,187 --> 00:36:15,775
You must miss it.
Not particularly. Thank you. Er...

570
00:36:15,817 --> 00:36:19,028
As a matter of fact, he's more
interested in medicine than sport.

571
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,989
I find that hard to believe.

572
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,825
You sound a little prejudiced.
Not at all.

573
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:27,412
He seems a nice enough example of
the type, I grant you.

574
00:36:27,454 --> 00:36:29,539
Er...

575
00:36:30,123 --> 00:36:33,877
But, as you say yourself, we're not
members of that tribe, you and I.

576
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:35,587
Spratt...

577
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:38,047
I think Dr Clarkson would like
some coffee.

578
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:40,633
And don't be such a snob.

579
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:43,762
I'm determined to get you over to
Sheriff Hutton.

580
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:47,432
The children are in the main house
now. I've been banished to a cottage.

581
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:49,559
Did you move before Hubert died?
No.

582
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:53,104
To be honest, I didn't want to go at
all, but I've got used to it.

583
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:56,775
Apart from anything else, I've never
been warm before!

584
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:07,452
Morning.

585
00:37:25,303 --> 00:37:29,224
So, why did you talk about Mr Bates
and Lord Gillingham's valet?

586
00:37:29,265 --> 00:37:31,351
What's the connection? Tell me.

587
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,146
There's no point trying to find
Mr Molesley...

588
00:37:37,649 --> 00:37:39,734
..because he can't help you now.

589
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:46,950
If that's how you want to play it,

590
00:37:46,991 --> 00:37:49,577
I'll give you until upstairs dinner
has finished,

591
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:54,749
after which I will ask to speak to Her Ladyship
and I will tell her your story.

592
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:56,876
Do you hear what I'm saying?

593
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,839
I can't tell you what I don't know.

594
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,966
But you know something.

595
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:07,595
And I think it links Mr Bates to the
dead valet.

596
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:25,168
I'm impressed by what I've seen.

597
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:27,321
Tom's a good partner,
so I'm lucky.

598
00:38:27,363 --> 00:38:30,116
I'm the lucky one.

599
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:34,495
Tom, what about your American plans?
Oh, I don't know. Nothing's fixed.

600
00:38:34,537 --> 00:38:38,374
But never fear. Mary is more than
ready to manage without me.

601
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:43,588
That's your man.

602
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:51,262
So, you're not frightened of being
left on your own to control your Papa?

603
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:55,641
I understand him better now,
and I think he'd say the same of me.

604
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:57,643
So he's not fighting all change,
then?

605
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,813
No, but he likes proper research.

606
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:03,733
You see, I want to improve
how we sell our grain.

607
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:06,527
If I make a good case for it,
he'll agree.

608
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:08,613
How positive you are.

609
00:39:08,654 --> 00:39:11,616
I've decided to live in the present
and not spend my life

610
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:15,369
regretting the past or dreading the
future.

611
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:17,788
I shall try to follow your example.

612
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,041
Do you dread the future?

613
00:39:20,082 --> 00:39:22,168
Only if I have to live it
without you.

614
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:26,797
Tony, I do love you, you know.

615
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,675
In my cold and unfeeling way.

616
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:32,762
Then why not say yes?

617
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,973
I don't want to get it wrong.

618
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:40,061
I'd like to marry again.
I've come that far.

619
00:39:40,102 --> 00:39:44,398
But I intend to be as happy with my
second husband as I was with my first.

620
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,026
It's bound to be a risk on some
level.

621
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:49,487
You have to take a chance.

622
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,866
The stable clock's fast.
We ought to get back.

623
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:58,746
By the way, Bates will look after you,
if you haven't brought a man of your own.

624
00:39:58,788 --> 00:40:02,333
Oh, that's rather a luxury for me
these days. I have no valet now.

625
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:06,546
Our butler takes care of me at home,
but when I travel I usually fend for myself.

626
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:10,591
Do you mind?
It makes things simpler.

627
00:40:10,633 --> 00:40:13,052
I'd love to make our lives simpler.

628
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,305
Hm.

629
00:40:19,058 --> 00:40:23,521
It's a nightmare when guests are a
nuisance and I feel so guilty,

630
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:26,691
but I wasn't sure we were even going
to make it down the drive.

631
00:40:26,732 --> 00:40:29,986
But what happened, exactly?
Well, there was this terrible noise.

632
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,154
A sort of rattle, rattle, bang,
bang.

633
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:35,116
And then the engine just seemed to
lose its power.

634
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:38,578
We'll get Tom to take a look at it.
Oh, how kind.

635
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:42,456
But I think my chauffeur, Weaver,
seems to have it in hand.

636
00:40:42,498 --> 00:40:44,458
Could I just use your telephone

637
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,169
and tell my hosts I won't be able to
get to them tonight?

638
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:50,590
But what will you do? Oh, we passed
a public house in the village,

639
00:40:50,631 --> 00:40:53,092
and I asked Weaver to see if they
had any rooms.

640
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:56,554
You can't possibly stay at the pub.
Why not? I'm tougher than I look.

641
00:40:56,596 --> 00:41:00,183
You must stay here. We have people
coming to dinner, so it'll be easy.

642
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,560
Oh, yes, it's perfect.
Oh, that's sweet.

643
00:41:02,602 --> 00:41:06,397
Molesley,
you look very Latin all of a sudden.

644
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:08,441
Do you have Italian blood?

645
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:12,445
No, m'lord. Not that I'm aware.
Or Spanish? Or Irish?

646
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:21,037
James... please tell Mrs Hughes that
Lady Anstruther will be staying.

647
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:24,165
If she could prepare
Princess Amelia.

648
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,292
Very good, Your Ladyship.

649
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:41,265
Go now. Tell her everything.
You don't know what you're asking.

650
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:46,312
I may not know your story, but I do know
it'll be worse if Mr Barrow tells her first.

651
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:48,439
Yes. You're right.

652
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:52,318
Thank you.

653
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:05,039
Why is she here?
They don't know her, do they?

654
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:09,001
Well, if they do, she never told me.
What are you going to say to her?

655
00:42:09,043 --> 00:42:13,214
Who says I'll get the chance to say
anything? Go on. Have it out.

656
00:42:13,256 --> 00:42:16,509
She's playing with you
like a cat with a vole.

657
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:21,264
James... did you know about
Lady Anstruther's visit?

658
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,184
No, Mr Carson. Why should I?
Didn't you work for her one time?

659
00:42:25,226 --> 00:42:27,645
I'm sure I've got a reference
from her somewhere.

660
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,814
But that was quite a while back,
wasn't it?

661
00:42:29,856 --> 00:42:32,984
Well, she's made extra work for
everyone.

662
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,111
That's all I know.

663
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:42,535
What do you mean, you need to tell
me something before Barrow does?

664
00:42:42,577 --> 00:42:46,747
Mr Barrow wants to tell you about
something in my past, m'lady.

665
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:50,084
I've a secret, you see.
A bad secret.

666
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:53,838
I don't understand. What secret?
How does he know it?

667
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,257
I was a friend of his sister's
when we were young.

668
00:42:56,299 --> 00:43:00,970
But if he knew something wrong about you,
why would he put you forward for the job?

669
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,307
I think you had better tell me.

670
00:43:04,974 --> 00:43:06,642
Very well.

671
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,979
A few years ago, I worked in London,
as a lady's maid

672
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:15,067
for a Mrs Benton who... lived with her
husband in Ovington Square.

673
00:43:16,736 --> 00:43:19,030
Go on.

674
00:43:19,071 --> 00:43:23,117
I was there for about six months,
and then I...

675
00:43:24,577 --> 00:43:27,038
And then you what?

676
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:29,165
I...

677
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:34,003
..took some jewellery belonging to
the mistress.

678
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:38,090
A necklace, a couple of bracelets,
some rings.

679
00:43:38,841 --> 00:43:40,927
You took them?

680
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:46,015
I tried to make it look like a
burglary, but it didn't work.

681
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,142
And Mrs Benton reported the theft?

682
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,772
They took me up a few hours later.

683
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:54,899
My fingerprints were everywhere.

684
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,818
And to make it worse...

685
00:44:02,198 --> 00:44:04,617
..I never gave the stolen things
back.

686
00:44:04,659 --> 00:44:06,744
Why not?

687
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:10,206
Because, by then, I didn't have them.

688
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,250
What happened?

689
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:15,002
I went to prison. For three years.

690
00:44:22,468 --> 00:44:24,971
Thank you, Baxter.

691
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:27,098
Very good, m'lady.

692
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:30,142
What do you make of our
mysterious visitor?

693
00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:34,021
Tom said he went to look at the car
and could find nothing wrong.

694
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:36,816
Maybe the chauffeur mended it.
Maybe.

695
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:38,943
We ought to go down.

696
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:46,158
Will there be anything else?

697
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:49,287
I don't think so. Thank you.
It's been quite a treat.

698
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:52,039
You don't travel with a valet
these days, m'lord?

699
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,668
No, no. When Green died,
I never replaced him.

700
00:44:56,586 --> 00:45:01,007
We were all shocked by the death of
Mr Green so soon after he was here.

701
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:03,134
Yes. Of course.

702
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,387
Had he been with you long?
Not very long, no.

703
00:45:08,181 --> 00:45:10,266
Right. Thank you.

704
00:45:26,532 --> 00:45:29,035
Well...?
I told her.

705
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:34,332
Now, I'm not asking what you said, but I
want to be sure that you held nothing back.

706
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:37,919
Good.

707
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,796
How was she?
I don't know.

708
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,341
Shocked, but not unkind.

709
00:45:43,382 --> 00:45:45,760
Then His Lordship walked in,
so that was that.

710
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:48,387
The point is, if she allows you to
stay,

711
00:45:48,429 --> 00:45:51,265
you're here in a truthful way and
not in a lie.

712
00:45:51,307 --> 00:45:53,392
And if I'm not allowed to stay?

713
00:45:54,185 --> 00:45:56,521
Well, you're still not caught
in a lie.

714
00:45:56,562 --> 00:45:58,648
That's what matters.

715
00:45:58,814 --> 00:46:01,442
I will tell you the story one day.

716
00:46:01,484 --> 00:46:06,989
But I'm loath to... forfeit your
good opinion, and I know I would.

717
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,116
No, you won't.

718
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:12,370
You don't trust me yet,
but I'm on your side.

719
00:46:12,411 --> 00:46:15,915
Mr Molesley, I need that up in the
servery. Now.

720
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:18,042
Yes, Mr Carson.

721
00:46:24,966 --> 00:46:28,344
Jimmy... I ought to scold you.

722
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:33,057
Why did you ignore my letters?
You're a very naughty boy.

723
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:37,228
Show Her Ladyship where to find the
drawing room, James.

724
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,230
Of course.

725
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:41,357
Will you come this way, m'lady?

726
00:46:50,032 --> 00:46:53,744
I feel so guilty, pushing into
a family celebration.

727
00:46:53,786 --> 00:46:57,999
You'd be an ornament at any
gathering. Oh, how nice. Thank you.

728
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,752
No cocktails?
I thought everyone had them now.

729
00:47:01,794 --> 00:47:05,423
Not at Downton. Our butler tried
them once and he hasn't recovered.

730
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,594
Oh, look at your parents.

731
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:12,346
34 years. I'd never manage it.

732
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:15,683
That's the advantage of an older
husband. One gets an early release!

733
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:17,810
Miss Sarah Bunting.

734
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:20,980
What on earth is she doing here?

735
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:23,566
I asked her. Cora said I could.

736
00:47:25,902 --> 00:47:29,572
Have I done something wrong?
She's the teacher I told you about.

737
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:33,576
After her behaviour while we were in London,
I don't think she's a suitable guest.

738
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:38,247
Let me introduce you.
Kitty Colthurst. Sarah Bunting.
Miss Bunting's a teacher.

739
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:41,167
Oh, golly! How clever.
What do you teach?

740
00:47:41,209 --> 00:47:44,086
The usual things. Writing.
Mathematics.

741
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:48,925
Crikey. Writing's almost beyond me,
and I wouldn't know where to start
with mathematics!

742
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:53,346
Well, then, you must marry someone
rich enough to ensure you never need to.

743
00:47:56,057 --> 00:47:58,893
Oh...
What are you doing here?

744
00:47:58,935 --> 00:48:03,940
Lady Rose invited me.
Rose, did you ask Lord Grantham?

745
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:06,067
Wasn't Cora's permission enough?

746
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:11,781
How are you?
I'm exhausted.

747
00:48:11,822 --> 00:48:14,116
Two parties in one day
is too much for me.

748
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:18,871
Was your luncheon a success?
You must ask Cousin Isobel.

749
00:48:19,622 --> 00:48:22,416
We've cast the net wide tonight.

750
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,127
Can't Tom have a friend of his own?
Oh, of course.

751
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:30,049
But it's time he decided whether he
is fish, flesh, fowl or good red herring.

752
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:33,344
Well, I think it's nice to see
an intelligent face here.

753
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:39,016
Miss Bunting has been shocking us
with her support for the Prime Minister.

754
00:48:39,058 --> 00:48:43,312
But surely, most of the country must support
him, or he wouldn't be Prime Minister.

755
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:47,149
There is an unanswerable logic in
that. Oh, quite.

756
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:50,862
There's an alliance that does not
bode well.

757
00:48:50,903 --> 00:48:54,323
I quite agree with you.
Aren't you being very snobbish?

758
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:59,120
We're being realistic - something
your generation has such trouble with.

759
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:09,505
Her chauffeur says there's nothing
wrong with the car that he could
find, so there's a mystery.

760
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,508
See? She's here to see you.
I don't know what she wants.

761
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,803
Don't you? Because I do.
It's embarrassing.

762
00:49:15,845 --> 00:49:18,431
I have a feeling it could get a lot
more embarrassing

763
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:20,766
if you don't find a way to keep her
quiet.

764
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:24,103
Take that.

765
00:49:24,145 --> 00:49:27,398
Marriage is a lottery, as we are
often told,

766
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,276
but I am a man who has drawn
a winning ticket.

767
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:32,320
I have been awarded a bumper prize:

768
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:36,991
beauty, brains, a heart,
a conscience, all in one.

769
00:49:37,033 --> 00:49:42,246
I give you my Cora, the best
companion in the world.

770
00:49:42,288 --> 00:49:44,373
Mama.
Lady Grantham.

771
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:49,921
What a tribute.
Indeed. If only it were true!

772
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:53,090
What's happened to Molesley's hair?

773
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:59,096
Carson, Lady Mary tells me that
you're to lead the Memorial Committee.

774
00:49:59,138 --> 00:50:02,308
That is so, madam. Yes.
You'll drive it splendidly.

775
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,645
Rose, is that friend of yours
terribly clever?

776
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:08,731
She's Tom's friend, not mine,
but I think so. Yes.

777
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:10,942
She certainly thought I was
terribly stupid.

778
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:13,402
Well, let's not shoot her down
for that.

779
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:26,749
No, thank you.

780
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,544
Do you know that footman?
Yes, he used to work for me.

781
00:50:29,585 --> 00:50:31,921
It's always nice to see
a friendly face.

782
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:34,632
Especially a friendly, pretty face.

783
00:50:34,674 --> 00:50:38,094
I'm not convinced these memorials
are a good idea,

784
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:40,471
but I suppose that's a different
issue.

785
00:50:40,513 --> 00:50:43,724
Why not? Won't they give people
a focus for their sorrow?

786
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:46,143
And a reminder of the sacrifices
that were made.

787
00:50:46,185 --> 00:50:49,480
If it were a memorial service,
then I might agree,

788
00:50:49,522 --> 00:50:51,482
but a stone edifice on the green,

789
00:50:51,524 --> 00:50:56,195
to remind us for ever of death and a
pointless war - what's the good of that?

790
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:58,281
To say nothing of the waste of
money.

791
00:50:58,322 --> 00:51:01,033
Forgive me, but you're talking
nonsense.

792
00:51:01,075 --> 00:51:03,661
Forgive me, but I suppose
she's allowed an opinion.

793
00:51:03,703 --> 00:51:07,331
Not that opinion. Not in this house.
I think what she means is -

794
00:51:07,373 --> 00:51:10,918
She is here as your friend,
so of course you must defend her.

795
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,712
But was the war worth fighting?

796
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:15,506
What did it achieve, beyond the
Russian Revolution?

797
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:19,844
Millions of men dead and no more
'justice' than there was before.

798
00:51:19,886 --> 00:51:22,180
You are wrong, both of you.

799
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:25,057
But we must strive to keep things
light.

800
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:27,643
It's a pity they didn't want you
on their Committee.

801
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:30,396
You put up a stout defence of
their intentions.

802
00:51:36,444 --> 00:51:39,197
They do want His Lordship on the
Committee.

803
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:40,865
Forgive me, My Lord.

804
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:44,160
I'd have told you later, but they
held a meeting this afternoon,

805
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:46,579
and they would like you
as their patron.

806
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:49,582
Oh, how nice. I dare say that was
always their plan.

807
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,709
I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.

808
00:51:51,751 --> 00:51:53,836
I should be glad to accept.

809
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,963
Now, if you can all put
your swords away,

810
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:59,634
perhaps we can finish our dinner
in a civilised manner.

811
00:51:59,675 --> 00:52:04,680
But I admire it, when young people
stand up for their principles.

812
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:06,807
Principles are like prayers.

813
00:52:06,849 --> 00:52:11,145
Noble, of course,
but awkward at a party.

814
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:20,353
James, did my eyes deceive me,

815
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:23,857
or did Lady Anstruther pass you
a note during dinner?

816
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:27,402
Yes, Mr Carson.
Can I see it?

817
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:33,158
He's thrown it away.
She just wanted to remind him that
he once worked for her, Mr Carson.

818
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:34,868
Even so, it's most irregular.

819
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,204
But it wasn't his fault, was it? He
could hardly slap her hand away.

820
00:52:38,246 --> 00:52:41,166
Get that up to the drawing room.

821
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:47,088
I gather from Mr Molesley that you
gave the good news to His Lordship.

822
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,508
Ah, that is correct.
How did you get them to agree?

823
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,220
I said I wouldn't serve if they
didn't make him Patron.

824
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:54,971
And have you told him that?

825
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:57,766
He doesn't need to know everything,
Mrs Hughes.

826
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,143
Nobody has to know everything.

827
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:05,206
I've enjoyed myself.

828
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:09,044
Both gatherings were interesting,
in their different ways.

829
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:12,131
You get on well with Lord Merton.
I know that.

830
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:16,385
I do, but Cousin Violet had other
plans for him at luncheon.

831
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:17,928
Where is Granny?

832
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,140
She said goodbye to your mother, but
she wanted to slip away.

833
00:53:21,181 --> 00:53:24,101
The day of parties had taken
its toll.

834
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:27,146
Before I go, I want to meet the
staff downstairs.

835
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:29,648
You don't think you've made enough
of a statement?

836
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,319
What about you?
I know. I got a bit carried away.

837
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,362
I thought you were splendid.
Cheer up.

838
00:53:35,404 --> 00:53:37,865
You're putting quite a dampener on
the evening.

839
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:41,702
Really? I thought only imbeciles
were happy all the time.

840
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,789
Here she comes.
The Boudicca of the North Riding.

841
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:47,833
Thank you so much for having me.

842
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:50,753
It was a pleasure.
Wasn't it, Robert?

843
00:53:51,837 --> 00:53:54,757
I want to thank your cook before I
go, and the other servants.

844
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,802
I'm afraid they'll be sitting down to
supper, and we don't like to disturb them.

845
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:02,348
I won't be more than a minute.
Of course you must go down.

846
00:54:02,389 --> 00:54:04,475
They'd be delighted.

847
00:54:06,101 --> 00:54:08,687
I assume you heard the way she spoke
to me at dinner.

848
00:54:08,729 --> 00:54:12,858
Of course, but how does it help to
answer rudeness with rudeness?

849
00:54:16,403 --> 00:54:19,323
Is everything satisfactory, m'lord?
No, it is not.

850
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:24,244
And can you please keep Molesley in the
kitchens until his hair stops turning blue?

851
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,795
What are you doing?

852
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:35,964
Setting out the breakfast trays for
Her Ladyship and Lady Mary.

853
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,050
Not Lady Rose and Lady Edith?

854
00:54:38,092 --> 00:54:42,304
Unmarried young ladies eat breakfast
in the dining room. Oh, do they?

855
00:54:43,097 --> 00:54:45,224
Thank you again, and I'm glad to
meet you.

856
00:54:45,265 --> 00:54:47,559
I felt I had to put faces to
his stories.

857
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,436
What stories are those?
Oh, that's a dangerous question.

858
00:54:50,479 --> 00:54:52,231
We may not like the answer!

859
00:54:52,272 --> 00:54:56,360
Do you work in the school? I teach mathematics,
handwriting and spelling, mainly.

860
00:54:56,402 --> 00:54:58,821
You must be so clever.
I wouldn't say that.

861
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:01,365
Come and meet the others.
Goodbye.

862
00:55:02,116 --> 00:55:03,951
That's such a different path.
It is,

863
00:55:03,993 --> 00:55:07,413
but it doesn't mean it's better than
the one you've chosen.

864
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:12,126
Your Ladyship, might I have a word?

865
00:55:15,796 --> 00:55:18,382
I'm very sorry to say it,

866
00:55:18,424 --> 00:55:22,469
but I've learned something that
makes me feel both responsible and guilty.

867
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:24,596
Would this have to do with Baxter?

868
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:29,893
Because, if it concerns her criminal
record, then I know all about it.

869
00:55:29,935 --> 00:55:31,895
Do you, m'lady?

870
00:55:31,937 --> 00:55:35,065
What I don't understand is why you
placed a convicted felon

871
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:37,234
in my household, in my bedroom,

872
00:55:37,276 --> 00:55:39,862
when you knew every detail
of her past.

873
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,573
I wanted her to have another chance.

874
00:55:42,614 --> 00:55:46,118
Don't you think that should have
been my decision, in my own house?

875
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,995
Yes, m'lady. Perhaps it should.

876
00:55:48,037 --> 00:55:54,043
So... why tell me now? Because, if you have
been using your knowledge against her,

877
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:56,295
I'll have to consider your future
here.

878
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:58,422
Indeed, whether you have one at all.

879
00:55:59,465 --> 00:56:02,259
I just thought I'd been wrong and
you ought to know.

880
00:56:02,301 --> 00:56:04,386
I see. Well, now I do.

881
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,930
Good night.

882
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,441
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

883
00:56:21,862 --> 00:56:23,947
Has Miss Bunting gone?

884
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:29,745
Yes. She got a lift down to the
village with Mrs Crawley.

885
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,872
That was nice of her.

886
00:56:37,044 --> 00:56:40,923
I wanted to apologise, for arguing
with you at dinner.

887
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,342
You were nothing, compared to her.

888
00:56:43,384 --> 00:56:45,386
She has her views - that's true.

889
00:56:45,427 --> 00:56:48,305
But I must confess, they remind me
of how I used to feel.

890
00:56:48,347 --> 00:56:52,559
Is that what you want, Tom?
To go back, when you've come so far?

891
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:54,895
I've come a long way from who I was.
That's true.

892
00:56:54,937 --> 00:56:57,022
And is it a bad thing?

893
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:06,323
- We're not lovers, you know.
- What?

894
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:08,242
That time when you were in London,

895
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:11,495
you thought that we'd got up to
something. We never did.

896
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,583
As Sybil's father, this is not an
easy conversation for me,

897
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,670
but if I was wrong, then I am sorry.

898
00:57:21,213 --> 00:57:24,800
The truth is, I worry less about that

899
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:29,138
than if Miss Bunting is taking you
back into the role of rebel and hater.

900
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:32,224
I'm not a hater.

901
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:34,351
I don't hate anyone.

902
00:57:35,936 --> 00:57:38,022
Least of all you.

903
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:43,986
Well, that is a more cheerful note to
say 'good night' on.

904
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,618
Isis!

905
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:54,330
But why didn't you give the jewels
back?

906
00:57:55,956 --> 00:57:58,500
You say you didn't have them by
then, but who did?

907
00:57:58,542 --> 00:58:00,461
More than that,
why did you do it at all?

908
00:58:00,502 --> 00:58:04,048
You don't strike me as being greedy.
You were working. You were earning.

909
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:06,300
Did you dislike Mrs Benton?
Was she harsh?

910
00:58:06,342 --> 00:58:10,471
No, m'lady. She was a kind woman.
That only makes it more mysterious.

911
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:14,850
I won't start concocting excuses for
myself. There are no excuses.

912
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:18,354
There may not be excuses, but there
is missing information.

913
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,693
You've shocked me, Baxter.
Profoundly. I can't deny it.

914
00:58:25,444 --> 00:58:31,075
You have every reason, m'lady. So, am
I to take it that I am dismissed?

915
00:58:33,327 --> 00:58:36,038
Your work is excellent, and I have
never sacked a servant

916
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,374
that gave me no cause for complaint.

917
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:43,587
Have I your word you will not commit
this crime again?

918
00:58:43,629 --> 00:58:47,841
I will never commit any crime again.
Not as long as I live.

919
00:58:50,928 --> 00:58:52,805
You may stay until I make
a decision.

920
00:58:52,846 --> 00:58:55,432
I cannot tell you how long
that will be,

921
00:58:55,474 --> 00:58:58,394
and I do not at all promise
I'll keep you on.

922
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:00,062
No.

923
00:59:00,104 --> 00:59:02,189
Very well.

924
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:05,943
I think we should leave it there
for now.

925
00:59:16,328 --> 00:59:20,416
I hope we don't have to see too much
more of Miss Bunting.

926
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:22,751
Lady Rose told Madge she liked her.

927
00:59:22,793 --> 00:59:25,087
And she seemed nice when she came
downstairs.

928
00:59:25,129 --> 00:59:29,425
Maybe, but she makes Papa say things
he doesn't mean,

929
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:32,177
and I know he hates himself for it
afterwards.

930
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:36,223
Mr Molesley...

931
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,978
I do not know why you have treated
your hair with a special substance -

932
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,771
Well, I -
But I can only say

933
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:46,108
that the effect on your appearance
is not what you would have it.

934
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,934
Take steps, Mr Molesley. Take steps.

935
00:59:48,963 --> 00:59:52,383
You will remain below stairs
until you do.

936
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:11,080
Well... So, Lady Mary's not quite so
ladylike, after all.

937
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:13,790
Me next.

938
01:01:20,632 --> 01:01:24,010
You think I'm mad, don't you?
It doesn't matter what I think.

939
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:27,596
Maybe she just wants to talk.
Maybe I'm the missing Tsarevich!

940
01:01:27,638 --> 01:01:31,183
The trouble is, I can't resist it.
Not when it's offered on a plate.

941
01:01:31,225 --> 01:01:33,101
Well, you're not alone there.

942
01:01:33,143 --> 01:01:35,187
Now, if you can stay with her
until three,

943
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:37,856
you'll get back to your room
without being noticed.

944
01:01:37,899 --> 01:01:42,987
I'll watch until you're in there. If you hear
me speak, just keep walking past her door.

945
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:46,366
Thanks, Mr Barrow.

946
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:48,493
Thomas. I mean it.

947
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,622
You're a real pal.

948
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:54,748
Well, I try to be.

949
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:10,556
But, Tony... you really shouldn't be
in here.

950
01:02:10,597 --> 01:02:13,850
Of course I shouldn't.
Why are you, then?

951
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:16,938
Because you're in love with me.
Am I?

952
01:02:16,979 --> 01:02:21,233
Well, you said so yourself. You were
torn between me and Charles Blake,

953
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:24,152
but I think you've decided
and I'm the winner.

954
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:27,322
Well, thank goodness that's settled.

955
01:02:28,073 --> 01:02:31,368
The trouble is, you want to be sure.

956
01:02:32,536 --> 01:02:36,498
Well, surer than the customs
of well-bred courtship will allow.

957
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,459
Go on.
I want you to come away.

958
01:02:39,501 --> 01:02:42,254
Just for a week, maybe less.

959
01:02:42,296 --> 01:02:47,926
But on our own, and we'll spend
the days... talking.

960
01:02:49,761 --> 01:02:51,763
And the nights?

961
01:02:51,805 --> 01:02:53,891
We'll spend those together, too.

962
01:02:55,851 --> 01:02:57,936
I want us to be lovers, Mary.

963
01:02:58,937 --> 01:03:03,817
I want us to know everything there
is to know about each other.

964
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:07,696
And then after that, I believe you
will be sure.

965
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:11,450
If Papa was here,
he'd hit you on the nose.

966
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:13,493
I'm trying to convince you
to marry me.

967
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:15,954
That's not the normal purpose of
seducers.

968
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:18,081
I don't think he'd see it that way.

969
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:21,668
What do you say to my scandalous
suggestion?

970
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,216
No-one must ever find out.

971
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:49,446
Fire!
What?

972
01:03:49,488 --> 01:03:51,823
Fire!
Oh, my God. George!

973
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:08,924
I've got Sybbie and George.

974
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:14,638
Thank God! Mary, you take them.

975
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,099
Tony, go with her. Tom, come with me.

976
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,518
You know where the sand buckets
are kept.

977
01:04:20,978 --> 01:04:23,397
Good god! Barrow, is she all right?

978
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:26,316
I think so, m'lord.
We must get her outside.

979
01:04:27,734 --> 01:04:29,820
Quickly, Tom!

980
01:04:31,822 --> 01:04:33,365
Tom, get the hose!

981
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:36,201
Rose, wake Mrs Hughes and the maids.
She'll do the rest.

982
01:04:36,243 --> 01:04:39,746
We must alert the firemen. Who knows
where to find Drewe's number?

983
01:04:39,788 --> 01:04:41,540
I do.
And save the dog!

984
01:04:41,582 --> 01:04:45,252
Barrow, hurry up! Get her away from
the smoke. I'll check the bedrooms.

985
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:48,046
Let me check the rooms, m'lord.
Now, man!

986
01:04:52,676 --> 01:04:54,761
Fire!

987
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:01,393
There's a fire.

988
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,896
Well, I'll see you both downstairs.

989
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:08,358
Everybody outside. There's a fire.

990
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,945
James? James? Where's James?

991
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:14,156
Peter, look in the bathroom
for James.

992
01:05:14,198 --> 01:05:16,283
Mr Molesley, hurry along, please.

993
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:26,793
Here, Tom!

994
01:05:31,298 --> 01:05:33,383
Mrs Patmore, do be careful.

995
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:36,762
Don't worry. Don't worry.

996
01:05:44,603 --> 01:05:46,688
We'll take over now, m'lord.

997
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:55,781
Thank you.

998
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:01,370
How are you feeling?
All right, I think.

999
01:06:01,411 --> 01:06:03,288
But I've been terribly stupid.

1000
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,415
Don't worry about that now.

1001
01:06:06,166 --> 01:06:09,461
Lord Grantham, I may sneak away
before breakfast.

1002
01:06:09,503 --> 01:06:11,755
Would you forgive me?
I have quite a way to go.

1003
01:06:11,797 --> 01:06:13,757
Perhaps that would be a good idea.

1004
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:15,884
M'lord...

1005
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:21,265
Barrow, we have to thank you -

1006
01:06:21,306 --> 01:06:25,644
for raising the alarm and rescuing
Lady Edith so bravely.

1007
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,063
What were you doing on the gallery?

1008
01:06:28,105 --> 01:06:31,817
Oh, just keeping an eye on things.
Well, thank goodness you were!

1009
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:35,654
I was angry with you before and
I was tempted to take it further,

1010
01:06:35,696 --> 01:06:39,825
but I accept that you have earned
our goodwill by your actions tonight.

1011
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:41,952
Thank you, m'lady.

1012
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,627
What's going on? What's happening?

1013
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:52,504
Don't worry. It's almost over.

1014
01:06:52,546 --> 01:06:55,674
Mr Bates wanted to come, to see you
were safe. We were so worried.

1015
01:06:55,716 --> 01:07:00,387
We're fine. Lady Edith chose to set
fire to her room, but we're fine.

1016
01:07:00,429 --> 01:07:02,598
I'll see if there's anything
I can do.

1017
01:07:02,973 --> 01:07:05,767
He's calmed down now, but he was in
a real state.

1018
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:09,897
He does get so worked up about
things.

1019
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:12,024
I can imagine.

1020
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,488
I don't wish to be harsh,
but I have a feeling

1021
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:21,033
James would be better
employed elsewhere.

1022
01:07:21,074 --> 01:07:23,660
Oh?
Please don't ask me why I think so,

1023
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:27,873
but I suspect his ambitions rather outstrip
what a career as a footman will yield.

1024
01:07:27,915 --> 01:07:30,500
As Your Lordship wishes.
Give him a good reference.

1025
01:07:30,542 --> 01:07:32,377
We don't want it talked about.

1026
01:07:32,419 --> 01:07:34,463
Understood, m'lord.

1027
01:07:34,504 --> 01:07:37,841
All clear now, m'lord. No real
damage beyond Lady Edith's bedroom.

1028
01:07:37,883 --> 01:07:39,968
Well, that's something.

1029
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:44,056
We can all go back inside!

1030
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:46,183
The excitement is over.

1031
01:07:50,062 --> 01:07:53,732
Might Lady Edith sleep in His
Lordship's dressing room tonight, m'lady?

1032
01:07:53,774 --> 01:07:55,359
Since the bed's made up.

1033
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,693
Of course.

1034
01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:59,571
I'm just going to thank the firemen,
Papa. Right.

1035
01:08:06,703 --> 01:08:10,123
Have you had any ideas?
Yes, and it's a simple one.

1036
01:08:10,165 --> 01:08:13,502
You are going to take a great
interest in little Marigold, m'lady.

1037
01:08:13,544 --> 01:08:16,630
Of course. We just need to introduce
the notion carefully,

1038
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:18,840
so everyone accepts and believes it.

1039
01:08:22,094 --> 01:08:24,930
You're to sleep in His Lordship's

2
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:32,856
A telegram for Lady Edith.

3
00:00:42,374 --> 00:00:44,786
Oh, you should go.

4
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:55,716
What about you?
No, not really.

5
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,466
I don't want to disturb you. Don't be
silly. You couldn't disturb me.

6
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:12,388
Thank you, Baxter.

7
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:21,135
I wouldn't have bothered you. Stop
talking like that and move back in.

8
00:01:21,136 --> 00:01:25,213
I only came to tell you that Edith's
about to receive some bad news. What?

9
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:27,664
How do you know?
Her editor's on his way here.

10
00:01:27,665 --> 00:01:29,662
It's what we've been waiting for.

11
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:33,056
However much you expect it,
it's still painful when it arrives.

12
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:41,312
You don't think it's good news?
If it were, he'd have telephoned.

13
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,594
When you see Madge, warn her.
Are you all set for tomorrow?

14
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,066
What's this?
I'm going to see the cottage again,

15
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,104
and then I have to make up my mind.

16
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:51,756
Mrs Hughes is coming with me.
I'll leave you to it.

17
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,814
What's it like, this cottage?
I don't know.

18
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,123
You can ask me after tomorrow.

19
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:01,603
Unless you want to come with us?

20
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,883
She wouldn't want me.
You know that's not true.

21
00:02:04,884 --> 00:02:07,540
It'd be good to
bury the memorial business.

22
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:09,957
See what she says -
but don't force her.

23
00:02:11,945 --> 00:02:15,181
Of course it's terrible,
but what did she think he was doing?

24
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:18,182
Living in a tree?
You mustn't make jokes, Milady.

25
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:21,075
Only in here. I'll be
as solemn as a church when I go down.

26
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,253
No, I am sorry, truly.

27
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:26,837
He was a nice man.
Though what he saw in Edith, I...

28
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:31,851
Goodness. The York and Ainsty
are holding a point-to-point

29
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,985
at Canningford Grange on Saturday,

30
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:37,620
and Mr Blake has persuaded Lord
Gillingham they should ride in it.

31
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:42,395
Don't you have to follow the hunt to be eligible?
They've been out with the York and Ainsty.

32
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,770
They'll have wangled it. I might join them.
Are ladies allowed to race with the men?

33
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:50,065
It changed just before the war.
Papa thinks it terribly fast.

34
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:53,131
Do they want to stay here,
Mr Blake and Lord Gillingham?

35
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:57,623
They want to meet at Canningford
and then come here that night. Golly.

36
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:00,835
Why would His Lordship come here
after you've broken it off?

37
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,556
Because he still won't accept
I know my own mind.

38
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:07,253
Anna, do you think
I'm looking rather frumpy?

39
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,123
Certainly not, Milady.
Hm.

40
00:03:09,124 --> 00:03:11,834
I'm tempted to remind them
of what they're missing.

41
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,702
You'd never be that heartless.

42
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:20,814
Shrimpie says he's narrowing the list
of possibilities,

43
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,615
and he thinks he'll track her down
before long.

44
00:03:23,616 --> 00:03:26,778
Are you going to tell the prince?
I think I should, don't you?

45
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:32,395
Would you like me to come?
No. I'll go alone this time.

46
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:38,973
Oh. I'm ever so sorry, Milady,
I didn't know you had company.

47
00:03:38,974 --> 00:03:42,842
This is Mrs Crawley, my cousin.
You'll find she's a frequent visitor.

48
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:44,824
Good day, Madam.
Hello.

49
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,902
Denker is my new maid.
She's trying to find her way around.

50
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:51,137
Did you have a question, Denker?
It can wait, Milady.

51
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:54,954
Well, I was going to ask you about
the luggage,

52
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,323
and which cases you prefer
when you travel.

53
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,613
Why, I don't travel much these days.

54
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:03,020
Why don't you ask Spratt?
He'll help you.

55
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:05,062
Oh, he'll help me, will he? Hmm.

56
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,173
That's good to know.

57
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,108
If you'll excuse me.

58
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:15,954
Honestly, Mr Barrow, take some time
off and have a rest. You look awful.

59
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:19,974
I'm fine, thank you. I've never felt
better. You've never looked worse.

60
00:04:19,975 --> 00:04:22,810
Since you are indifferent
to my opinions, Mr Bates,

61
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,576
it's only fitting I am indifferent to
yours. I'm nipping to the cottage.

62
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:30,570
- I've left my button box there.
- Oh, that's Lady Mary.

63
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,734
She must want something before lunch.
You go, I'll fetch it.

64
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,485
Would you? Thank you.

65
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,190
Do we know when he'll get here?
Later this afternoon.

66
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:51,538
I should have some drawings for you all to
look at before long. What sort of drawings?

67
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:56,690
Ideas for how we could renovate the run-down village
houses. Why is there such a building spurt?

68
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,812
The war showed how half
the population were badly housed.

69
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:03,608
They were shocked by how unhealthy
some of the new recruits were.

70
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:06,743
"You cannot expect to get an A1
population out of C3 homes."

71
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,779
Who said that?
I think it was on a poster.

72
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:12,948
I heard from Charles today.
He and Tony are competing

73
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:15,662
in the point-to-point at Canningford
on Saturday.

74
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,898
Atticus was talking about that.
Atticus?

75
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:21,660
Atticus Aldridge, the chap I met in
York. Has he become a friend?

76
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:25,297
Yes. His parents, the Sinderbys,
have bought Canningford Grange.

77
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:28,694
Now they're wooing the county.
Lord Sinderby's rich, isn't he?

78
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,731
Who'd take it on if they weren't?

79
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:34,298
Why don't we all go, make a day of
it? We could ask Granny and Isobel

80
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,613
and take the children. Shall I tell
Charles they can stay here?

81
00:05:37,614 --> 00:05:39,535
Course, if you want them to.

82
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,817
When this fellow arrives, it would be nice if you
could leave Edith and me to see him on our own.

83
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:22,774
This must be it. Ah.

84
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,738
Really, Milady? You do surprise me.

85
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:32,267
I hope your standards are
not so high as to prevent you

86
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:34,931
remaining in my employment, Denker.

87
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:37,663
No, not at all.
Not as high as that, Milady.

88
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:40,960
Where's the...?

89
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:42,895
Where's the knocker?

90
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,255
You... You stay here.

91
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,335
I've shown him
into the drawing room,

92
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:10,240
but I'm afraid it is as we feared.

93
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:13,390
Oh, I am sorry.
His Lordship's with them now.

94
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:17,230
He's here, then?
Yes, and it's not looking hopeful.

95
00:07:17,231 --> 00:07:21,218
Oh, dear. Mrs Hughes says
you want to come with us tomorrow.

96
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:25,307
Only if you wouldn't mind.
This is the olive branch, I suppose?

97
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:28,370
If it's too much trouble -
No, no.

98
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,317
You can buy the tea.

99
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,140
Mr Carson wants to see the cottage.

100
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:39,370
He wants you to forgive him.

101
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,821
Why don't you come too?
I've got work to do.

102
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:45,229
You seem to be working harder
than when Miss Bunting was around.

103
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,747
I am.
I'm determined not to let her down.

104
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:54,296
Some tea? I can just about make tea.

105
00:07:57,881 --> 00:08:01,801
How did you find me?
Rose gave me your address.

106
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:04,453
And you came alone
to this part of the city?

107
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:08,310
I was accompanied by my maid.
She's waiting outside.

108
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:11,240
How wonderful to be back in a world

109
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,063
where ladies are
accompanied by their maids.

110
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,259
Why didn't your son provide you
with a car?

111
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,052
Oh, he would have done. I just didn't
choose to tell him where I was going.

112
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:29,143
It is not our first
secret assignation.

113
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:36,413
I always feel more comfortable...
leaving the past in the past.

114
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,210
Then why have you come?

115
00:08:40,211 --> 00:08:43,530
Because Rose's father,
Lord Flintshire,

116
00:08:43,531 --> 00:08:46,102
thinks he's close
to finding the Princess.

117
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:52,682
She's alive, then? She was alive
when she left Russia. That they know.

118
00:08:53,812 --> 00:08:57,032
They think she was put on a boat
headed for Hong Kong.

119
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:58,911
You'll know more soon.

120
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:13,671
I wanted you
from the moment I first saw you.

121
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,570
More than mortal man
ever wanted woman.

122
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:19,505
That is an historical detail.

123
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,402
Nonsense.

124
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:27,030
If Irena were dead, I would ask you
to run away with me now.

125
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,100
You couldn't run away

126
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,388
when there's no-one left
to "run away" from.

127
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:35,585
I loved you more than I loved her.

128
00:09:37,601 --> 00:09:39,600
Even today.

129
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,547
Even this afternoon.

130
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:45,170
Please don't.
Why not,

131
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:47,290
if it's true?

132
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:50,192
Because you'll make it sound as if
we were both unhappy,

133
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:54,608
and I don't believe you were -
and I certainly was not.

134
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:56,751
You wouldn't admit it
if it were true.

135
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:04,336
You think to be unhappy
in a marriage...is ill-bred.

136
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,374
You do know me, Igor.

137
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,585
That I must concede.

138
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:17,409
Yes.

139
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:23,747
Who was that?
Sergeant Willis.

140
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:30,538
He wants to come back with that man
from Scotland Yard.

141
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:33,592
I don't like the sound of it.
Is it to see Mr Bates again?

142
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,570
That's the funny thing.

143
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,420
He wants to see Miss Baxter
this time. Miss Baxter?

144
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:41,155
What's she got to say about it?
Search me.

145
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:44,819
When are they coming?
Tomorrow morning.

146
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,063
I hope they don't stay all day -
or we'll miss our appointment.

147
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,256
He's gone.
Didn't he want some tea?

148
00:10:56,257 --> 00:11:00,437
I offered him tea, dinner and a bed for
the night, but he had to get back.

149
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,764
Gregson's dead, I'm afraid.

150
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,289
How terrible that is to hear.

151
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,609
And was it this Herr Hitler?

152
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,379
Apparently.
Or at least his gang of thugs,

153
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,468
during the so-called
Bierkeller Putsch in Munich.

154
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:19,856
It took days for the police to get
the city back under control,

155
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:22,209
and by then any trace of Gregson
was buried.

156
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,113
They've found him now, of course -
or what's left of him.

157
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,770
It's too horrible to think about.

158
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,869
At least they've locked Hitler up
for five long years.

159
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,012
Coombs says he won't serve
five years, or anything like it.

160
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,259
There's another thing.

161
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,577
Edith inherits Gregson's publishing
company. I think I expected that.

162
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,221
I hope, somehow, it helps her
get through this.

163
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:48,990
It was very generous of him.
I suppose they loved each other.

164
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,358
Oh, poor Edith.
How is she taking it?

165
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:55,049
Hard to say.
It wasn't a surprise, of course.

166
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,862
But there's always a shred of hope,
isn't there? Shall I go and see her?

167
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:00,761
She's gone for a walk.

168
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,636
She wanted to be on her own.

169
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,950
I'm sorry, Milady, I'm afraid
it's not convenient just now.

170
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:20,070
L-I only want a moment.
As I said, it's not convenient.

171
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:22,397
What's this?
I don't want her to come in.

172
00:12:22,398 --> 00:12:25,227
Well, there's no need to be rude.
Of course not.

173
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,518
Well, she's not coming in -
and that's flat.

174
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,189
I'm trying to bring her around, but
I wish you hadn't jumped the gun.

175
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,337
I know, but I had some bad news today
and I needed to see her.

176
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:41,947
You mean you were right about
Marigold's father?

177
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,489
I'm very sorry to hear it.

178
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,199
But if you could just give me some
time. I don't have time, Mr Drewe.

179
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:56,762
Of course I'm sorry, but let's face
it - he's been dead for over a year.

180
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,873
That's when he went missing.

181
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:02,292
Yes, but he didn't die for
Lady Edith until this afternoon.

182
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:04,813
That's what matters, isn't it?
I suppose so.

183
00:13:04,814 --> 00:13:08,882
What are you studying now, Daisy?
The War of the Spanish Succession.

184
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:10,808
Oh. As a matter of fact, I'm Ve...

185
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:15,664
Very what, Mr Molesley?

186
00:13:17,354 --> 00:13:19,311
Er... Oh, never mind.

187
00:13:23,874 --> 00:13:27,504
Ohh... I'm sorry to disturb
Your Ladyship. What is it, Spratt?

188
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,954
We are having rather a problem
with Miss Denker.

189
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:34,245
She does not seem to grasp
the laundry arrangements here.

190
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,721
She wants it all to go to the big
house, even the... smaller items.

191
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:41,674
You're losing your sense of
the appropriate, Spratt.

192
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:43,921
You're losing your sense of occasion.

193
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:46,363
But she's back there
in the kitchen now,

194
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:50,143
shouting at the top of her voice,
and refusing to wash your... things.

195
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:54,234
Well, I'm sure this is
all very interesting to Mrs Crawley.

196
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:57,137
I'm sorry, Milady, but I can't
help it. May I send her in?

197
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:03,418
I do apologise. Oh, don't.
I'm enjoying it immensely.

198
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:05,643
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

199
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,842
Are you going to the picnic at Canningford
Grange on Saturday? I think I might.

200
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:13,184
Oh, I'm glad, because...
No, never mind.

201
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,263
What were you going to say?

202
00:14:15,264 --> 00:14:17,847
Only that I've asked
Lord Merton to tea tomorrow.

203
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,413
Have you decided at last?

204
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:24,497
Yes, I think so. Oh.
But please don't pester me.

205
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:27,773
- I'll let you know on Saturday.
- Oh.

206
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:31,261
I'm having rather a problem
with Mr Spratt, Milady.

207
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:34,225
I do not know if Miss Collins
pandered to him,

208
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:38,276
but he seems to have no knowledge of
the proper role of a lady's maid.

209
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,133
Well, we all pander to Spratt
in this house, Denker.

210
00:14:42,134 --> 00:14:46,143
He rules us with a rod of iron.
All except me, Milady.

211
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:49,956
But I see you have company, so we'll
discuss this at some other time.

212
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:55,155
And you wonder why I have
neither lady's maid nor butler.

213
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:02,672
When I've done these,
I might go back to the cottage

214
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:04,773
and read until our dinner.

215
00:15:04,774 --> 00:15:08,133
Madge says Lady Edith is
dreadfully cut up,

216
00:15:08,134 --> 00:15:11,504
and it's extra hard because
he was killed so long ago.

217
00:15:11,505 --> 00:15:15,343
And I suppose she can't expect the
whole household to go into mourning

218
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,087
when he was no relation
and he's been dead for so long.

219
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:24,761
Will you please tell me
what is the matter?

220
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:28,832
I couldn't find your button box.
I'd forgotten all about it.

221
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:31,794
Oh, well, never mind.
It'll turn up. I did look.

222
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,613
I looked in all the cupboards,

223
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:37,481
and I found some other things.
Oh, yes? Yes.

224
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,428
I found a book by Marie Stopes

225
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:45,934
and a box containing
a cunning piece of equipment

226
00:15:45,935 --> 00:15:49,253
to ensure there would be
no Baby Bates.

227
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:52,831
And I'm supposed to applaud your
poking around in my things, am I?

228
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,752
Now, just a minute. It is not for
you to be angry with me -

229
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:58,759
it is for me to be angry with you.
How do you make that out?

230
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,693
You tell me
you are longing for a child,

231
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,573
that it's in the hands of God,
but you seem to have

232
00:16:04,574 --> 00:16:08,303
put it in the very practised hands
of Miss Stopes.

233
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:11,365
You're wrong. It's not like that.
Then what is it like?

234
00:16:11,366 --> 00:16:13,463
Come in, Lily.

235
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:15,330
I'll leave these on the table
for you.

236
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:20,721
Ah, Daisy, there you are. I wondered
if you'd like to borrow this.

237
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:24,132
What is it? The fifth volume of
The Cambridge Modern History.

238
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:26,685
My dad gave me the whole set
for my 40th birthday.

239
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,087
I don't know.
I've got so many books already.

240
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,966
Don't be churlish.
Mr Molesley's offering to lend you

241
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:33,936
one of his prized possessions.

242
00:16:33,937 --> 00:16:37,783
There's a good chapter on the war
and politics in Queen Anne's reign.

243
00:16:37,784 --> 00:16:40,734
But if it's not interesting to you,
I quite understand.

244
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,624
No, I will look at it. Thank you.

245
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:50,326
He's very kind, you know.
We should always be polite

246
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:52,976
to people who are kind.
There's not much of it about.

247
00:16:58,205 --> 00:17:00,520
What have you told Bates?
Nothing.

248
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,320
And he hasn't asked why you're
sleeping in here? Certainly not.

249
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:07,579
I wondered if you might like to
change your mind and come back.

250
00:17:11,124 --> 00:17:14,845
You heard Mr Bricker say he was
not in my room by my invitation.

251
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,531
How do I know that wasn't
just his gallantry?

252
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:20,461
Because I'm telling you.
Nothing happened.

253
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:25,522
I'll tell you what did happen. You
allowed him into your private life.

254
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,802
A man who thought he could
step into my place, just like that.

255
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:32,004
He thought it - and he was mistaken.

256
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:41,274
Very well. If you can honestly say
you have never let a flirtation

257
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:44,831
get out of hand since we married,
if you have never given a woman

258
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,672
the wrong impression,
then by all means stay away.

259
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:50,156
Otherwise, I expect you
back in my room tonight.

260
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,571
But why me?
What have I got to do with it?

261
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:14,093
I wasn't working here
when Mr Green first came.

262
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:17,012
That's right. She only came -
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

263
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,740
Even so, we understand
you have some information

264
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,423
concerning Mr and Mrs Bates.
What information?

265
00:18:22,424 --> 00:18:24,421
That's what we hope you'll tell us.

266
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:27,890
I want to talk about your past.
Would you prefer we were alone?

267
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:30,812
I can't allow you
to question a maid in this house

268
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:32,863
without my being present.
Miss Baxter?

269
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:35,873
Let her stay.
Very well.

270
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:38,813
When you served your prison
sentence for theft - What?

271
00:18:38,814 --> 00:18:40,880
They released you after three years,

272
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:43,962
leaving the remaining two years
to lie on the books. Yes.

273
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:46,494
You know that if you break the terms
of your release,

274
00:18:46,495 --> 00:18:49,321
you can return to prison
without a trial? That seems -

275
00:18:49,322 --> 00:18:53,547
Mrs Hughes, one more interruption
and I will ask you to leave.

276
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,731
You think I know more than I do.

277
00:18:55,732 --> 00:19:00,113
I believe there was an incident
when Mr Green was staying here.

278
00:19:00,114 --> 00:19:03,596
And there may have been a journey
to London that no-one knew about,

279
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:06,213
but I couldn't swear to any of it.

280
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:09,559
Not even whether it was
Mr Bates who made the journey?

281
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,023
Not even that.

282
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,561
Thanks for your help, Miss Baxter.

283
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:18,413
Who told you I knew anything?

284
00:19:18,414 --> 00:19:20,783
We had a letter.
From whom?

285
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:23,082
Good day, Mrs Hughes.

286
00:19:25,134 --> 00:19:27,842
I am going to ask one question.

287
00:19:31,214 --> 00:19:33,573
Does Her Ladyship know your story?

288
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,157
Yes, she knows everything.

289
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:40,364
Then we'll say no more about it.

290
00:19:45,744 --> 00:19:48,133
Come and see these.
Oh, yes,

291
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:51,392
this is just the kind of work
we're looking for, isn't it?

292
00:19:51,393 --> 00:19:54,142
I knew you'd say that.
Why? They'd cost the most.

293
00:19:54,143 --> 00:19:57,403
And these designs? They'd be
much cheaper. Much nastier.

294
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:01,206
A lot of the renovated cottages will
be occupied by lifetime tenants.

295
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:03,362
We'd have no real income
for 2O years.

296
00:20:03,363 --> 00:20:08,001
So instead of Mr Wavell's horrid houses, we'll
make our own? Tom's protecting the estate.

297
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:10,725
What's the matter, darling?
She's very listless.

298
00:20:10,726 --> 00:20:12,684
I wonder if she's picked up a germ?

299
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:15,921
She'd have eaten a dead squirrel
or something equally fell.

300
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:19,215
She's quite fat. Perhaps she's
pregnant. No, she can't be.

301
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:21,520
So, what do we say about
these drawings?

302
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:25,225
I suppose we should go for the
cheaper option, but it's a shame.

303
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:28,537
Anyway, I must fly. I've got
an appointment in York in an hour.

304
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,773
Mrs Hughes,
have you seen Miss Baxter?

305
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:35,533
It's not like you to seek her
company. I'm serious, Mrs Hughes.

306
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,789
It's all right. I heard.
Could I talk with you, please?

307
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:48,262
Come in here.

308
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:11,787
I'm sorry about this.
Go on. I can take it.

309
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:18,023
God in heaven.

310
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,385
I thought it would pass,
but it just keeps getting worse.

311
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:26,443
I can't sleep.
I'm not surprised.

312
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,367
Help me.

313
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:33,352
You were always asking if I need
help. Well, now's your chance.

314
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,526
I don't know what to do.
We're going to the doctor,

315
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:41,693
now, and we'll show him the syringe,

316
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:45,883
and the liquid you injected, all the
pills you've been taking, all of it.

317
00:21:45,884 --> 00:21:49,052
Follow me down in five minutes,
and we'll meet by the backdoor,

318
00:21:49,053 --> 00:21:51,706
and bring everything with you -
do you understand?

319
00:21:57,325 --> 00:22:00,413
I've done something
that I shouldn't have.

320
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:03,816
And if you knew what it was, you
wouldn't want to be part of this.

321
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,513
I know what it was.

322
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:08,176
Now, come down in five minutes.

323
00:22:13,524 --> 00:22:15,515
Ahh.

324
00:22:17,284 --> 00:22:19,973
It is wonderful on you, My Lady.

325
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:22,923
I hope so. My father will explode.

326
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,870
Mais superbe.

327
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,538
Thank you.

328
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:31,611
You've made me feel very strong.

329
00:22:32,794 --> 00:22:36,219
Does this cover it?
My Lady is very generous.

330
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:44,643
At least she can carry it off.

331
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,874
Most of them look like
bald monkeys.

332
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,879
Hold on.

333
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,868
And it won't trouble him further?

334
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,260
Not as long as he stops
poisoning himself.

335
00:22:57,261 --> 00:22:59,729
You've had a look at the things
he brought, then?

336
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:05,227
You've been injecting yourself
with a solution of saline.

337
00:23:05,228 --> 00:23:09,355
That's not harmful, though, is it?
It obviously wasn't sterilised.

338
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:13,719
Repeated injections would cause
fever, and abscesses at the site.

339
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,042
I assume this is a course of
treatment you've spent money on?

340
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,148
Yes, a lot of money.

341
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,153
I went to London
for what they call electrotherapy.

342
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:27,018
And the pills and injections were
supposed to continue the process.

343
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,908
The purpose of which was...?

344
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,303
To change me.

345
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,221
To make me more like other people.

346
00:23:40,368 --> 00:23:42,325
Other men.

347
00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:48,921
Well, I'll not be coy and pretend I
don't understand. Nor do I blame you.

348
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:52,177
But there is no drug,
no electric shock,

349
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:54,527
that will achieve what you want.

350
00:23:54,528 --> 00:23:56,724
You mean I've been taken for a mug.

351
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:59,457
My advice to you, Thomas,

352
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,589
would be to accept the burden that
chance has seen fit to lay upon you.

353
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,107
And to fashion as good a life
as you are able.

354
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:09,398
Remember - harsh reality is
always better than false hope.

355
00:24:13,058 --> 00:24:16,540
Well, that will give you
a good laugh. It won't.

356
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,356
And I don't expect you
to understand,

357
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:22,874
but I think it shows you
to be a very brave person.

358
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,367
What?

359
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:30,746
To inflict such pain on yourself
to achieve your goal.

360
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:34,105
Think what you
could do in this world

361
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:35,975
if you just set your mind to it.

362
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,181
You're daft - do you know that?

363
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,536
I must telephone Atticus
to warn him we're all coming.

364
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:49,748
Ask him for dinner tonight
if he's free.

365
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:54,517
Could I? I mean, just as a friend.
Well, just as a friend, absolutely.

366
00:24:57,418 --> 00:24:59,386
I wish Isis would perk up.

367
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:03,361
I might ask Stapeley
to have a look at her.

368
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,259
It can't hurt.

369
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:11,018
I think it's very nice, very solid.

370
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,747
Oh, I hope it is solid,
at this price.

371
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:17,480
What's the kitchen like? Oh,
not quite the scale you're used to.

372
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:20,807
Well, I wouldn't mind -
it'd be my own.

373
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:23,539
I could live here later
when I stopped working.

374
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,668
There's only one flight of stairs,

375
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:28,948
so I'm sure I could manage that,
no matter how old I get.

376
00:25:28,949 --> 00:25:31,999
Oh, an outside privy, I see.
That'll bring back memories.

377
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,083
Well, Lord knows
I've seen one of them before.

378
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,591
But 'appen I could change things
round when I move in.

379
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:41,512
I'm sure you could.

380
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:47,705
Well, that's it. I'm going to take
it. Now, if you'll come outside,

381
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:49,951
I'll take the key back
and give him my answer.

382
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:55,427
I envy her.

383
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,193
Have you ever thought about
your life in retirement?

384
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:01,965
Who says I'll live to retire?

385
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:09,097
Is everybody ready? What is this?
Oh, it's my cousin Mary.

386
00:26:09,098 --> 00:26:12,265
She says she's got a surprise
for us. You'll love her.

387
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:15,171
I intend to love everybody.
Ready or not, I'm coming in.

388
00:26:17,938 --> 00:26:21,018
Pola Negri comes to Yorkshire.

389
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:24,537
Well, we really are
living in the modern world.

390
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,668
Golly, I'm jealous.
Mary, this is Atticus Aldridge.

391
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,719
At last, Mr Aldridge.
Rose has talked of nothing else.

392
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,018
Oh, she's only teasing. Can't I take
it as a compliment?

393
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:38,497
Granny, what do you think?
Oh. It is you.

394
00:26:38,498 --> 00:26:41,320
I thought it was a man
wearing your clothes.

395
00:26:41,321 --> 00:26:44,167
It suits you.
Papa, do you agree?

396
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:47,995
It's certainly just the sort of
thing I would expect of you.

397
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:50,597
I suppose you disapprove?
Not especially.

398
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:54,234
I'm just amazed that even you
would choose the day after I learn

399
00:26:54,235 --> 00:26:56,959
the man I love is dead
to try out a new fashion.

400
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,877
I don't believe that's quite fair.
And you've planned a jolly picnic

401
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:03,445
for Saturday.
Am I really expected to join in?

402
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:06,089
Hopefully not,
as you usually spoil everything.

403
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,057
Huh. Yes, I do.

404
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:11,787
It seems I do.

405
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:14,120
Goodnight, Mama.
I'll have a tray in my room.

406
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:18,591
I'm sorry, Mr Aldridge, but you
might as well know what we're like.

407
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:26,466
Poor darling. She's so unhappy. She
hasn't clapped eyes on him in years.

408
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:29,306
She must have known long ago
he was dead - we all did.

409
00:27:29,307 --> 00:27:32,508
But should we go on Saturday?
Please don't cancel.

410
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,357
Rose and I are going,
whether you're coming or not.

411
00:27:35,358 --> 00:27:38,522
Maybe it would be good for her to
have time on her own to think.

412
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,987
All this endless thinking.
It's very overrated.

413
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:44,070
Oh, Aunt Violet, I do love you.

414
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:49,838
I blame the war. Before 1914, nobody
thought about anything at all.

415
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,448
But what would I want
with such a thing?

416
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:58,777
I'll tell you.

417
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:01,947
It's quite simple.
To avoid bearing my child.

418
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:05,840
How can you believe that...
when it's all I've ever dreamed of?

419
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:07,808
Because you think I'm a murderer.

420
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:18,169
What are you saying?

421
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,678
We know how Vera died.
Not Vera.

422
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,592
But...

423
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:28,442
...Mr Green.

424
00:28:36,788 --> 00:28:38,715
How long have you known it was him?

425
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:41,598
I've known since the first day
I heard that it happened.

426
00:28:42,868 --> 00:28:46,078
You can't have. You may have
suspected, but you didn't know.

427
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:48,389
I knew when he came back.
I knew when he said

428
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,200
he went down to the kitchens
during the concerts.

429
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:57,748
And I kept telling myself you didn't
know, so it couldn't have been you.

430
00:28:59,618 --> 00:29:01,791
Who killed him, you mean?

431
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,712
I wanted to.

432
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,752
I was going to.

433
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:18,828
I went into York very early, and
I bought a return ticket to London.

434
00:29:18,829 --> 00:29:21,833
I planned to get there and back
in the same day.

435
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,834
I went onto the platform,
but I never got onto the train.

436
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:32,722
Because I knew...

437
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:36,759
...if I saw him,
I would have killed him.

438
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:41,366
And if I killed him...
I would hang.

439
00:29:42,428 --> 00:29:44,317
I couldn't do that to you.

440
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,268
Thank God.

441
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,807
The next day, when I heard what had
happened, it was like...

442
00:29:50,808 --> 00:29:52,722
the hand of fate.

443
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:57,547
I had the ticket in my coat pocket,

444
00:29:57,548 --> 00:29:59,737
like a talisman.
What for?

445
00:29:59,738 --> 00:30:02,187
Because if I'd have travelled,
I'd...

446
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:06,001
I would've handed in both halves.
The fact that it was in my pocket,

447
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:09,278
untorn, was proof
that I never travelled.

448
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,192
Which is why you were so angry
when I gave it to Mrs Hughes.

449
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:18,808
If the clerk in York
remembers selling me

450
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:20,677
a return ticket to London,

451
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:24,396
I'm a dead man.

452
00:30:25,948 --> 00:30:28,018
Why are you smiling?

453
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:30,317
Because you're innocent.

454
00:30:31,178 --> 00:30:33,169
I have lived in such fear...

455
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:36,158
...and such trembling,

456
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:39,310
and all the while
I couldn't tell you why.

457
00:30:40,818 --> 00:30:42,752
And now I'm just so happy.

458
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,409
Mad as it sounds, I'm so happy.

459
00:31:01,108 --> 00:31:03,031
What do you make of Lady Mary's hair?

460
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:07,507
They were all talking about it.
I hope she comes down to show us.

461
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:09,569
Miss Bunting
loved the new hairstyles.

462
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:13,350
She said women were being set free.

463
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,735
I'm sorry Miss Bunting's gone.

464
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:19,824
She gave me such confidence.
She'd tell me how sharp I was,

465
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,976
how quick.
I agree with her.

466
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:25,825
It's harder on your own,
harder to believe.

467
00:31:25,826 --> 00:31:27,999
Well, could I help?

468
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:32,783
Not with mathematics, probably,
but I know a bit about history

469
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:37,423
and I've read a few books. How old
were you when you left school? 12.

470
00:31:37,424 --> 00:31:39,753
It was a shame, really.
I was quite bright.

471
00:31:39,754 --> 00:31:41,680
And my dad wanted me to stay on.

472
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,427
He thought I could be a teacher,
if that doesn't make you laugh.

473
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:49,163
But he couldn't manage it.
We had no money, you see,

474
00:31:49,164 --> 00:31:53,063
and then my mother got ill and
so I had to earn as soon as I could.

475
00:31:53,064 --> 00:31:55,070
Why don't you take Matric now?

476
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:57,665
No, I've missed it.

477
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,385
But I'd like to help.

478
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,320
Make sure somebody got away.

479
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,795
Mrs Hughes?

480
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:13,442
Do you remember that overcoat
I gave you, for the refugees,

481
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:16,064
when we were in London
for Lady Rose's ball?

482
00:32:16,065 --> 00:32:18,525
I do. They were very glad of it.

483
00:32:18,526 --> 00:32:22,405
It sounds mad, I know,
but did you find a ticket in it,

484
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,420
in the pocket?

485
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:28,915
Of course. You won't remember.
No, I do.

486
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:32,345
I did find one, a return to London.

487
00:32:32,346 --> 00:32:34,335
That's it.

488
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,282
Come...

489
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:40,035
You see,

490
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:44,905
Mr Bates does know
that it was Mr Green. Oh, my Lord!

491
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:47,674
But he didn't do it, Mrs Hughes.
I know that now.

492
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,988
And if we had that ticket
we could prove it.

493
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:54,005
We could prove that he never went to
London. I don't understand. How?

494
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,910
Because it wasn't torn.

495
00:32:57,746 --> 00:33:01,745
Of course, you threw it out.
Why wouldn't you?

496
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,745
I must have done. I'm so sorry.

497
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:07,807
It's not your fault. It's mine.

498
00:33:09,506 --> 00:33:12,185
I gave it away.

499
00:33:12,186 --> 00:33:14,644
I gave away the proof of
my husband's innocence.

500
00:33:28,156 --> 00:33:31,558
Come on,
get your pies, get your pies!

501
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:06,875
Well, I think you are very brave.

502
00:34:06,876 --> 00:34:10,315
Brave? I'm petrified. I don't even
know the horse I'm riding.

503
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:12,276
How long is the course?
Three miles.

504
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:14,683
Twice round a course of
a mile-and-a-half.

505
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:17,361
To where you can see
that steeple over there.

506
00:34:17,362 --> 00:34:20,795
Well, hello.
What on earth are you doing here?

507
00:34:20,796 --> 00:34:23,288
What do you think?
Riding the point-to-point.

508
00:34:25,586 --> 00:34:29,674
Won't someone introduce us? This is
Mabel Lane Fox. Lord Grantham.

509
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:33,265
Where are you staying? Last night
I was with the Lawsons at Brough,

510
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:36,115
but they're away tonight
so I'll head back to London.

511
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,997
What a trek. You'll be exhausted.

512
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:41,063
Stay with us. Lord Gillingham
and Mr Blake will be there.

513
00:34:41,064 --> 00:34:45,129
Have you brought enough clothes?
Oh, I think so. I know so.

514
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:48,385
Are you riding?

515
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,622
What's this? Where have you been?

516
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:54,805
Mr Aldridge and I fixed it last night. His
nice parents let me change at the house.

517
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:57,463
I do wish you'd call me Atticus.
I admire you.

518
00:34:57,464 --> 00:35:00,757
It'd be a poor show not to ride at
our own event. Quite right.

519
00:35:00,758 --> 00:35:04,345
I shall cheer you on. What about
you? When did you decide to ride?

520
00:35:04,346 --> 00:35:08,116
Yesterday, when I was having my hair
done in York. What about a horse?

521
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:11,988
Stephen rode Trumpeter over earlier.
They're down by the starting post.

522
00:35:11,989 --> 00:35:15,804
This does seem like too much of
a coincidence. Are you stalking me?

523
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:18,891
I shall ignore that as I'd
hate to think of you as a vain man.

524
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,795
Well, you certainly know
how to surprise.

525
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:25,050
That sounds like a compliment.
I must say hello to Charles.

526
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:31,552
Well done. You seem to have
got things off to a good start.

527
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:34,916
What would you have done if Lady
Grantham hadn't asked me to stay?

528
00:35:34,917 --> 00:35:36,897
I'd have suggested it myself.

529
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:47,654
Oh, I thought you'd gone with them.

530
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:50,832
No, I've a lot to do. To be honest,
it's not really my thing.

531
00:35:50,833 --> 00:35:56,075
Are you going out again? No.
I've a new tenancy contract to check,

532
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:59,011
and I want to go through the figures
for the repair shop.

533
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:01,965
You see, I'm going away.

534
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:05,368
I didn't know that.
No, well, I haven't told anybody.

535
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,685
I don't understand.

536
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:12,685
You don't have to, but when they get
back, tell them my mind was made up

537
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:14,620
and I wasn't hysterical or anything.

538
00:36:15,536 --> 00:36:18,525
And give them my love.
Oh, God, Edith.

539
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:21,018
Won't you wait
and talk to them about it?

540
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,405
If I talked to anyone, it'd be you.

541
00:36:23,406 --> 00:36:25,738
Then talk to me, please.
I can't.

542
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:30,416
But good luck.
You're a fine man, Tom.

543
00:36:31,716 --> 00:36:34,213
You mustn't let them
flatten that out of you.

544
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:36,724
Won't you tell me where you're going?

545
00:36:36,725 --> 00:36:39,484
Or can't I at least drive you
somewhere? No.

546
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,983
But I will take one of the cars
to the station

547
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:44,422
and leave the keys
with the station master.

548
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:46,738
I just wish -
I can't stay, Tom,

549
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:49,580
not if I'm ever
going to be happy at all.

550
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,411
It's lunacy! You've lost your mind!

551
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,979
Tell her.
It's true.

552
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,226
Marigold's her daughter.
It's a lie!

553
00:37:12,227 --> 00:37:14,476
I don't know
what she's holding over you,

554
00:37:14,477 --> 00:37:16,599
but you can't
let her get away with it!

555
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,767
I have a copy of
her birth certificate.

556
00:37:18,768 --> 00:37:22,379
It's in French, but you can read
my name. Which was brave of you.

557
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,385
My aunt wanted me to use a false one, but I
knew I might need proof. Give that to me!

558
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:32,168
I have others. You've cooked this up
between you. That's enough.

559
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:35,177
We've nothing formal that gives us
any claim over her.

560
00:37:35,178 --> 00:37:37,877
Only a note from her dying father.
Which I wrote.

561
00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:42,978
How could you do this?

562
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:49,928
I'm your wife, yet you have lied and
cheated and used me shamefully.

563
00:37:49,929 --> 00:37:53,576
If you'd have taken a mistress
you couldn't have been more false.

564
00:37:53,577 --> 00:37:58,871
Mrs Drewe, I know you don't want to
hear this, but I'm very grateful.
No, I don't bloody want to hear it!

565
00:37:58,872 --> 00:38:01,288
Fetch her things.
I will not!

566
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:03,223
Then don't.

567
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,438
- No! No! No!
- No...

568
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,305
My baby. No...
There we go.

569
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,158
Wait! just wait, wait.

570
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,093
Wait.

571
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,510
She'll not sleep, else.

572
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,007
Don't be afraid, my darling...

573
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:42,972
This nice lady is your new mummy.
She loves you,

574
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,628
more than anyone else could.

575
00:38:46,629 --> 00:38:48,677
But don't you forget...

576
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:54,483
...that we love you, too.

577
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,367
Best of luck!
Let me not fall in front of Rose.

578
00:39:21,368 --> 00:39:23,329
I'm glad her opinion matters.

579
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,630
I'd rather not look a fool quite
yet. She can discover it gently.

580
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,177
I'm dying to ride astride.
Why don't you?

581
00:39:32,178 --> 00:39:34,299
Not if my grandmother's watching.

582
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,536
You surprise me.
You seem more than able

583
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:40,309
to choose which laws to keep and
which to break. Don't be spiky,

584
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,509
when I only want what you want.
Which is?

585
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,152
For you and Tony to walk into the
sunset together. I do resent you.

586
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:49,611
I resent your ability to take him
off me, when I know how to make him

587
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:53,096
happy, and I certainly love him more
than you do. That's all true.

588
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:56,576
Then why turn up looking like a
cross between a Vogue fashion plate

589
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:59,311
and a case of dynamite?
I can't make it too easy for him.

590
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,305
They're just about ready to go.

591
00:40:02,929 --> 00:40:04,863
Can I have a look, Donk?

592
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,030
Can you see Aunt Mary?
Yes.

593
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:17,423
I think she's splendid.

594
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,158
I think she's cracked.

595
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,969
It's good to do some crazy things
when you're young.

596
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:26,728
As long as you survive them.

597
00:40:26,729 --> 00:40:29,505
Some do crazy things
all their lives. Hmm.

598
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:33,948
What answer did you give?

599
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,473
I'm going to tell them
when we're all together.

600
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:40,439
You won't give me away?

601
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,748
You mean you've accepted him? Huh.

602
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,456
I know you'll think me foolish,

603
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:50,953
but I feel it's my last chance
of a new adventure before I'm done.

604
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:57,345
Huh. Well, now you've accepted him,
you'll hear no more argument from me.

605
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:30,666
Go on!

606
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:33,337
Go, Atticus, go!

607
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,668
Come on, faster!

608
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,303
Tony!

609
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:31,260
You might have allowed her to be
the first woman. Nonsense.

610
00:42:31,261 --> 00:42:33,427
I don't believe in
letting people win.

611
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:36,710
Even if it's in your own interest?
Mm-hm. You rode well.

612
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:41,478
If I make it across the finishing line
at all it's a miracle, as far as
I'm concerned. Nonsense.

613
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:43,638
You're a positive centaur.

614
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:47,485
See? He's nearly there - if you'd
just stop jerking his lead.

615
00:42:47,486 --> 00:42:52,268
Well done, but thank God you're all
back in one piece. Who's this?

616
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:57,155
My parents. Mother, Father, this is
Lord and Lady Grantham.
Lady Mary you already know.

617
00:42:57,156 --> 00:43:01,306
Lord Gillingham, Mabel Lane Fox,
Charles Blake and, of course, Rose.

618
00:43:01,307 --> 00:43:03,785
Lady Rose,
how lovely to see you again.

619
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:06,148
Come back to the house to bathe
and change.

620
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:09,440
I'm going to leave it until we get
back to Downton, but thank you.

621
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,346
I can't tempt you
to stay for dinner?

622
00:43:11,347 --> 00:43:13,310
Not today. We're covered in dust.

623
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:17,236
Come to Downton tomorrow for dinner.
That seems rather an imposition.

624
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:19,879
Not at all.
Then we'd be delighted.

625
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,809
You haven't met my mother-in-law and our
cousin, Mrs Crawley. Good afternoon.

626
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,076
If the parents of Rose's young man
are coming for dinner,

627
00:43:28,077 --> 00:43:31,298
things must be
more advanced than I realised.

628
00:43:31,299 --> 00:43:34,997
He seems a nice boy, and it's not
like the Catholics, is it?

629
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:37,248
She won't be expected to convert.

630
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:40,218
Con... Convert to what?
Judaism.

631
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,306
I read in an article, Lord Sinderby

632
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:44,882
is a leading figure
in the Jewish community.

633
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:48,671
There's always something,
isn't there?

634
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:55,368
What do you mean, gone?
She's gone.

635
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:59,447
She didn't say where, but I doubt
it's to Lady Rosamund's. Why?

636
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:02,545
Of course she was very upset about
Gregson, but why run off?

637
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,418
I think I'll slip away, Carson.
ls the car still outside?

638
00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:11,800
They're just unloading it now,
My Lady. I'll - You stay here.

639
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:13,648
I can manage.

640
00:44:13,649 --> 00:44:16,055
Could you take those two down?
Yes.

641
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:19,462
Whose cases are these? Lady Mary's.
They're her riding things.

642
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:24,104
These are Miss Lane Fox's.
If you could take them in.

643
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:28,728
Home, please. Can you
first stop at Yew Tree Farm?

644
00:44:28,729 --> 00:44:30,254
Yes, Milady.

645
00:44:34,059 --> 00:44:37,828
Lady Edith has taken off.
What do you mean? She's gone.

646
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:39,720
She left her car at the station.

647
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,430
Mr Branson's walking down there now
to pick it up.

648
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:45,151
Oh, it must have been
the news from Germany. Tsk.

649
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:48,440
Poor thing. Well, I ought to
go and ring the gong.

650
00:44:48,441 --> 00:44:50,353
Hm.

651
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:54,938
Mrs Hughes,

652
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:59,059
may I make a suggestion that I think
you'll find a strange one,

653
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,256
but I ask that you consider,
none the less.

654
00:45:01,257 --> 00:45:03,648
Heavens. I'm all agog.

655
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:05,549
Do you think that we should... um...

656
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:10,875
...invest in a property together?

657
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:13,889
What on earth do you mean?

658
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:18,448
I was thinking, if Mrs Patmore
can do it, then we might buy

659
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:21,510
somewhere jointly,
as a business venture, mind,

660
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,418
spruce it up
and share the rental income.

661
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:26,547
We'd have a tidy sum
by the time we retired.

662
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:30,433
Go and ring that gong.

663
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:40,498
Well, so the birds have flown?

664
00:45:40,499 --> 00:45:43,719
I won't say anything about it,
Your Ladyship. Not to anyone.

665
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,648
Nor will she.

666
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:50,549
Do you know where she's gone?

667
00:45:51,929 --> 00:45:54,009
No.

668
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:58,868
Well, thank you so much,
Mr Drewe, Mrs Drewe.

669
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:02,191
I mustn't take up
any more of your valuable time.

670
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:23,469
They'll bring a cot for
the young 'UN, madam.

671
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,781
Ring down if there's anything else.
I will do. Thank you.

672
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,988
Oh.

673
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,912
Thank you.

674
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,712
Well, we're together, darling.

675
00:46:39,249 --> 00:46:44,088
I know it's not ideal, but it's such
an improvement on being apart

676
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:46,788
that I think we should celebrate.

677
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:50,111
I'll order ice cream,
and a glass of Champagne,

678
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:53,199
and we'll be as jolly as you like.

679
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:56,645
Yes?

680
00:47:00,379 --> 00:47:03,148
I'll see you at dinner.
Not if I see you first.

681
00:47:03,149 --> 00:47:05,817
Atticus seems to be very taken with
your niece.

682
00:47:05,818 --> 00:47:08,386
I have a little announcement.
Are you sure?

683
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:12,276
I've got used to having a companion.
Your positions have changed.

684
00:47:12,277 --> 00:47:15,945
We're all thinking of a different
future, whether we want to or not.

685
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:19,274
Kiss me. What?
Kiss me - now.

686
00:47:19,275 --> 00:47:19,720

1
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,160
I assume Drewe knows we're coming.

2
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,100
Yes. I sent a note yesterday.

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,160
Have the pigs recovered,
do you think?

4
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,020
They look in good shape to me,
after the shock of their arrival.

5
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,140
But why didn't he check to see

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,180
... they all had water
before he left for the night?

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,020
Maybe he thought a full trough
was enough.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,980
He wasn't to know
they'd kick it over.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,080
Mr Branson is right.
He should have made sure.

10
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,220
You would have done.

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
Where did you learn about pigs?

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,180
We've always had pigs at Yew Tree,
m'lady.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,220
Not many,
but enough to learn their ways.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
Thank heavens you did.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,020
So, have you found a man
to take over?

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,200
Not yet.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,220
First, we'd like to know
if you'd want the job.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,060
Me? You mean I'm to manage the pigs
for the estate, as well as my farm?

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,140
It's asking a lot.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,140
I can do it. If you're sure.

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,080
Let's give it a try,
see how we get on.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
I'm very grateful, m'lady.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,060
This is the second good turn
I've received from your family,

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,040
and I just hope
I can pay back a favour one day.

25
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,140
How nice of you.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,140
I don't know if it's much of
a favour.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,140
We're giving you a lot of work.
Work's like old age, m'lady.

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,240
The worst thing in the world
except for the alternative.

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,200
It's only me.

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,080
I always feel that greeting betrays
such a lack of self worth.

31
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,140
How are we today?

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,140
My dear, please stop talking to me
as if I were a child past hope.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,140
Very well. How are you feeling?

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,180
Like Doctor Manette.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,120
If I don't get out of this house
soon,

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
I shall remember nothing
but my number.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,200
Then why don't we walk to the Abbey
this afternoon, if it's fine?

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Hear how Robert's getting on
in America.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,180
Is it really called
the Tea Pot Dome scandal?

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,100
It seems so unlikely.
What's it about?

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,240
What is it always about?
Bribery and corruption.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,060
Taking money
to allow private companies

43
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,160
to drill for oil on Government land.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,180
Mr Levinson has
one of these companies?

45
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,060
I assume so.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,140
Have you ever met him?
Once. At the wedding.

47
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,080
And once was quite enough.

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,180
I can't tell you how thrilling
that sounds. I'll be waiting for you.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,040
We'll have such a lovely day.

50
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,060
Who was that?
No-one. Just a friend.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,100
You have to pull your weight
with the bazaar.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,060
It seems to have crept up on me.

53
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,020
Does Cousin Robert usually do it?

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,100
He does. Half the village
hates the other half

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,020
and only he can stop them
tearing each other's throats out.

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,140
I admire that. It's a real skill.

57
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,240
Mr Molesley, erm,
is it true that you were a valet?

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
For the late Mr Crawley?

59
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,020
And butler to his mother
before that.

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,100
I've come down in the world.
You can climb up again.

61
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,160
Maybe. But life kicks the stuffing
out of you sometimes, doesn't it?

62
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,220
Oh, I've had my stuffing kicked out
more than once.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,100
I've woken and wondered
if there was any point to it.

64
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,080
Yet here I am,
lady's maid to a countess.

65
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,080
So, it can happen.

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,040
Now you've made me curious.

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm curious about something
and you could help me.

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,100
Do you know if Mr and Mrs Bates
have had a falling out?

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,980
Mr and Mrs Bates?
That doesn't sound very likely.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,020
Can I ask you
to put that machine away?

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
We'll be laying for tea in a minute.
Of course.

72
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,200
Is everything ready
for the servants' tea?

73
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,020
Oh, is it just me or do we have
twice the bills we used to?

74
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Ivy, this is for you.

75
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,100
Did you find those oyster shells
for the kettle?

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
I've put them in. About time.
It were full of scale.

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,020
What in God's name was that about?

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,180
Don't rise to it. She just wants us
to think her life's interesting.

79
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Anything interesting?
I'm reading about County Politics.

80
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,240
They're looking for candidates
for the local Council.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,060
Why don't you put yourself forward?

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,120
But what are my politics these days?
I'm not sure.

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,120
You could always read a bit
about it.

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,220
You won't find many books
on the Liberal ideals in this room.

85
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
And nothing at all about Socialism.

86
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,160
If you're serious about driving me
to Thirsk tomorrow,

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,040
perhaps we might find some then.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,020
Are you better now, Granny?

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,980
If you'd been to see me, you'd know.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,980
Don't bully me. I'm not up to it.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
No. Rosamund told me.

92
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,100
When? What did she say?

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,240
Only that you needed
a little cherishing, that's all.

94
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,020
So Mr Drewe's accepted your officer.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,140
I'm so pleased.

96
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,040
The Drewes have been at
Yew Tree Farm for many years.

97
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,020
I suppose you think
that's sentimental bosh, Mr Blake.

98
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,140
Don't be too hard on him, Granny.

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,140
Mr Blake has a softer side
than we first gave him credit for.

100
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,220
I'm relieved to hear I am redeemed
before we leave for London.

101
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,060
I hope I'm forgiven, too.

102
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,140
I know you thought me very snobbish
when you first arrived.

103
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,140
I don't blame you. Given my work,
I came as an envoy of the enemy.

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,240
Are we too early?
Bring them in, Nanny.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,100
I don't think anyone will mind.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,060
Your Papa might,
but he isn't here to complain.

107
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,020
One moment, darling,
while Mummy puts away her cup.

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Oh, here, let me. Hello there.

109
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh, it's all right.

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,180
He's turning into quite a bruiser.

111
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes, and I must go.
Stay and have some dinner, Mama.

112
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,040
You needn't change.
No. Thank you, my dear, but no.

113
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,220
You should change and I should go.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,040
When you go down, can you give
a message to Mrs Hughes?

115
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,080
Of course.

116
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,180
Lord Gillingham telephoned today.

117
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,140
He wants to break his journey home.

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
Tomorrow night.

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,220
He'll be here again?

120
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,020
You're right.
I shouldn't encourage him,

121
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,160
but I couldn't think what to say
to persuade him not to.

122
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,240
Do you think me very feeble?

123
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,140
It's not that, m'lady.

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,120
Then what is it?

125
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
Anna?

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,080
It's nothing to bother you with.
Please bother me.

127
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
If I did, you'd have to promise
to do nothing about it.

128
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,140
But how does this concern
Lord Gillingham?

129
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,240
It doesn't, m'lady. It's nothing to
do with Lord Gillingham himself.

130
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,180
But then...
It's his man, m'lady.

131
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,160
His servant, Mr Green,
who travels with him.

132
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,120
Oh, my God.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,020
But the police ought to -
No!

134
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,240
I must tell Lord Gillingham.
No, m'lady, you promised.

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Mr Bates doesn't know it was him.

136
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,080
But the more he comes here,

137
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,000
the more likely it is
that Mr Bates will find out.

138
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,040
Then I'll telephone him and tell him
not to come, or not to bring Green.

139
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm frightened every time Mr Green
and Mr Bates are in the same room.

140
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,240
You think, if he guesses,
he'll do something.

141
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,160
And if he does, they'll hang him.

142
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,020
Or lock him up
and throw away the key.

143
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,100
Jimmy, the savouries can go in
and Daisy'll bring up the sauce.

144
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,080
And now perhaps you can explain why

145
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,140
you have apparently been
under hypnosis since dinner began.

146
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,240
I don't know what you mean.
Yes, you do.

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,140
Mooning about
like a sloth under water.

148
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,060
Well?

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,180
You know I had a letter earlier?

150
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,140
It were from Alfred.
It seems his father died

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,000
and Alfred's coming up
for the funeral.

152
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,080
Oh, I am sorry.
That's not all.

153
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,020
He says he wants to marry me.

154
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,020
What?! Just like that?

155
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,020
He says the way I behaved
towards him when he were last here

156
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,140
made him hope
that things had changed between us.

157
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,180
Well, you were very friendly.
That's not all.

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,060
He wants me to leave Downton
and go up to London.

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,980
He says he can find me a job.
Blimey.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He puts a lot in a letter,
does Alfred.

161
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,980
They're serving the savouries.
We'll talk about it later.

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,160
Now, er,
put the water on for the coffee.

163
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
That's enough for one day, surely.
You can finish them tomorrow.

164
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,060
Shall we walk back to the cottage?
The others are going to bed.

165
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,100
What were you saying to Mrs Hughes?

166
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,060
Just that Lord Gillingham's
asked himself for the night again.

167
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,120
He can't stay away.

168
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,180
Yes. It's a bit of a tangle.

169
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,980
Do you think she's sweet on him?

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
They're sweet on each other, but
it's not as simple as that, is it?

171
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Then there's Mr Blake.
I thought she didn't like him.

172
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,160
She didn't. At first.

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,200
Anyway,
they can sort it out between them.

174
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
And Mr Green.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,200
He'll be coming back.

176
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,060
Have you gone off him?

177
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,980
Why do you say that?

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,060
You liked him so much
when he first came.

179
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,980
You thought he was funny.
Did I?

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't remember.

181
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,680
So, you're pleased with Mr Drewe?

182
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,520
I am. And I'm very pleased with the
pigs too. They're a grand addition.

183
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,660
When they've settled,
you ought to consider dairy.

184
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,600
Another job
for the splendid Mr Drewe.

185
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,480
I think he IS rather splendid.

186
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,720
He seems to want to make farming
at Downton his life's work.

187
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,560
That's very lyrical.

188
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,740
Lady Rosamund Painswick
is on the telephone, m'lady.

189
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,580
Do you have anything planned
for today?

190
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,720
Some shopping. That's all.

191
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,700
Do you think I should write
and give him my answer?

192
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,680
If you're sure about it.
I don't want to marry Alfred.

193
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,600
Then there's no more to be said.

194
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,600
Even if I did, I wouldn't care to
tie myself down yet.

195
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,680
How do I know
what life has in store?

196
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
You're a very optimistic generation,
I'll say that.

197
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,640
What are you talking about?
Nothing.

198
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,500
I wish you'd say, cos it's clear
as day you're up to something.

199
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,580
None of us know
when Papa's coming back.

200
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
But yes,
we must tell her before then.

201
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,500
In fact, I've had an idea.

202
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,560
Well, if you're sure, then why not?

203
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,520
We've already got friends of Mary
staying. Ring with the train time.

204
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,640
'Bye-bye dear.'

205
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,480
Who was that?
Aunt Rosamund.

206
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,660
She's coming to see how Granny is.
Why are you down so early?

207
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,560
I've got to check some figures with
Tom before he goes into Thirsk.

208
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,620
Quite the businesswoman.

209
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,500
We must rise to life's challenges.

210
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,580
Yes, I suppose we must.

211
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,640
Let's meet in the book shop
in ten minutes.

212
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,580
I've got some letters to post.
I'll see you there.

213
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,540
Thank you.

214
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,740
Good day.

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,660
Don't, don't do that.

216
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,560
You mustn't be so self-conscious.

217
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,680
A black singer with the daughter of
a marquess in a Yorkshire town?

218
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,580
Why should we attract any attention?
Well, that's their problem.

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,500
It doesn't have to be ours.

220
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,680
I'm terribly puffed
that you made the journey.

221
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,560
Me too, but...
But what?

222
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,640
I hope we're brave enough for this.
Of course we are!

223
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,620
Isn't it time people knew
there are bigger and better values

224
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
than the mean-spirited ones
they live by?

225
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,500
Does Lady Grantham know
you're out for the day?

226
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,540
It won't matter
as long as I'm back for dinner.

227
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,680
Are you playing tonight?
I wouldn't be here if I were.

228
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,600
I can stay for as long as you want.

229
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,740
Well, I want you to stay forever,
but six o'clock will do.

230
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,640
You're not very talkative.
What's the matter?

231
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,600
I was thinking about
a couple of people

232
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,720
who are in a situation
which will cause trouble.

233
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,620
Will it make them unhappy?

234
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,660
It's hard to say.

235
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,500
It'll make some people unhappy.

236
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
I thought I might make some coffee.
Would you like a cup?

237
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,660
No, thank you.

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,620
It's just coffee. You won't have to
surrender any of your independence.

239
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,620
Er, you win.

240
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,600
Er, milk but no sugar.

241
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,480
Miss Baxter,

242
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,580
I do know what it's like,
to feel fragile.

243
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,520
I've felt fragile my whole life.

244
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,520
You'll have realised by now that,
down here,

245
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,740
we don't much care for Mr Barrow,
which may offend you.

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,660
I'm not...offended.

247
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,740
But I wish you'd give us credit for
making up our own minds about you.

248
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,620
Hello.

249
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,540
This is Miss...
Bunting. Sarah Bunting.

250
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,520
And this is Mrs Crawley.

251
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,520
I met Miss Bunting at the political
meeting you sent me to. In Ripon.

252
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,520
Ah, so that was the reason.
Why do you say that?

253
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,720
He wasn't exactly enthralled
to the cause of the Liberals.

254
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,720
Though I'm not now convinced
by his Socialism. Why not?

255
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,560
I didn't know then that you were
the land agent and son-in-law

256
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,520
of our local milord.
I'm surprised I'm so famous.

257
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,520
Won't you defend your principles?

258
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,500
No, not now.

259
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,580
Then I will. Mr Branson
is a keen political thinker.

260
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,700
He proves this by not being afraid
to question his own beliefs.

261
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,740
Very eloquent.
I'd stay to argue, but I'm late.

262
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,660
Do you live around here?

263
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,560
I work here.

264
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
At the school.

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,500
It was nice to see you again.

266
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,740
Hello, Miss.
Hello.

267
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,620
She knows her own mind.
Yes, I think she does.

268
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,560
Apparently, he left the Dalrymples
straight after breakfast,

269
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,500
so I missed him when I telephoned.

270
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,660
You did your best.
I am so sorry.

271
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,700
Come in!

272
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,540
No tails? You know Granny's coming.

273
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
Oh, God, is she? I didn't realise.

274
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,600
No, don't change. It's time
she learned about the real world.

275
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,660
A phrase with more than
one definition.

276
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,580
Can I have a word?

277
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,500
I've seen something,

278
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,680
and I'm not saying
there's anything wrong about it,

279
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,540
but I'd feel uncomfortable
if I kept it to myself.

280
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,560
I'm all ears.

281
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,480
This morning in Thirsk,...
I saw Rose.

282
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Yes, she was shopping.

283
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,540
No, she was not shopping.

284
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,700
She was...meeting a man.

285
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,560
I saw her as she reached up
to stroke his cheek.

286
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,720
Oh, golly. Who is it this time?

287
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,600
It was Jack Ross -
the singer with the band

288
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,560
who came up for your father's party.

289
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,660
Well, that's it. I've told you
and I have nothing more to add.

290
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,640
Anna?

291
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,600
She's told you, then?

292
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,580
Don't give me away Mrs Hughes,
please.

293
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,700
I can get through it.

294
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,560
My maid said
you were waiting in here.

295
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,540
Everyone else
is in the drawing room.

296
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,620
I know,
but I thought you'd want to hear.

297
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,480
I think I know how
I can keep the baby.

298
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,580
What? How?

299
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,520
There's a tenant farmer,

300
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,480
whose family has been at Downton for
years. I'm sure he can be trusted.

301
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,560
This is very reckless.

302
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,600
Well, what would you suggest?

303
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,520
I'd suggest that we go away,

304
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,680
you and me, on an extended trip
to...somewhere.

305
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,720
Then the baby can be adopted by
a childless couple in that country,

306
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,640
wherever it may be,
and they are made very happy.

307
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
And the baby is happy,
and you are...

308
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,520
..well, if not happy, at least free.

309
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,620
But I wouldn't be part of
its growing up?

310
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,520
You wouldn't be part of its life.

311
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,660
Why is my idea so reckless?

312
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Oh my dear, where shall I start?

313
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,600
Suppose the farmer talks?

314
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,720
Suppose you're seen
visiting his home,

315
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,700
which I presume is the idea?

316
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
Suppose the baby looks like you
and people in the village notice?

317
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,520
Suppose you talk?

318
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,520
I left a list somewhere
that I need for Mrs Patmore.

319
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,520
You know Lord Gillingham is here.

320
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,600
Er, yes. We were just chatting.
We're coming now.

321
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,520
I'm desperately trying to take
control of the bazaar.

322
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,640
Talk about herding cats.
I'll stay and help if you want.

323
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,600
You may regret saying that.

324
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,540
And while I'm here, we can discuss
a plan that I'd like to get settled.

325
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,700
I've always wanted to speak
better French than I do,

326
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,700
so I thought I'd take a few months
off, go to...Switzerland

327
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,660
and really learn it.
I see. Not France?

328
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
You know what the French are like.

329
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,580
While Switzerland is so clean.

330
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,680
And they have wonderful hospitals...
in case we get ill.

331
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,680
We? I wondered if Edith might like
to come. Keep me company.

332
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,620
I'll pay.

333
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,700
What do you have to say about that?

334
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,660
I'd like to.

335
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,740
Goodness. Oh. Well,...why not?

336
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,600
Golly, life is full of surprises.

337
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,500
But I'd better check to see that
the young men are keeping the peace.

338
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,560
So we won't have to tell her?

339
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,500
I don't think we need to, do you?

340
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Can you really afford to spend four
months reading novels in the Alps?

341
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,540
Why ask the question
when the decision has been made?

342
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,700
Come on, we ought to join the others.

343
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,600
Have you been wandering round
Scotland since we saw you?

344
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,540
I have. I was on the Spey.

345
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,480
I did a tour of the cousinage,
then a wedding in Ayrshire.

346
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,640
I've enjoyed myself.
It gave me time to think for once.

347
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,700
Oh, what about particularly?

348
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,500
My life, I suppose.

349
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,600
Everyone should, from time to time.

350
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,680
Oh, I can't agree. In my experience
it's a dangerous occupation.

351
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,720
Dangerous?
Well, no life appears rewarding

352
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,600
if you think too much about it.

353
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,680
I gather you've launched into pigs
these days.

354
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,600
Yes. And their arrival
was quite the adventure,

355
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,520
in which Mr Blake and Mary
were the hero and heroine.

356
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,740
Is this what you wouldn't tell me
when I was last here?

357
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,520
Only because I didn't want to make
too much of it.

358
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,720
Lady Mary was perfectly splendid.
Lady Mary IS perfectly splendid.

359
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,620
Really, Charles,
are you a pig expert, as well?

360
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,500
He was that night, thank heaven.

361
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,720
Rosamund and Edith
have some exciting news.

362
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,560
What's that?

363
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,640
We're going on a sabbatical
so we can really improve our French.

364
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,600
The only thing I ever learned from
my governess was how to say

365
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,640
"please", "thank you"
and "I have a temperature."

366
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,740
Very useful if one were travelling.

367
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,680
Do you remember her, Mama?
She was always in tears.

368
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,680
Oh, poor Mademoiselle. Her life was
full of... complications.

369
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,520
I think she quite enjoyed it,
though.

370
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,620
But why you?
You don't want to learn French.

371
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,520
Or is this an incognito search
for the missing Mr Gregson?

372
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,520
Don't tease her.
It's much more serious than that.

373
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,520
Thank you, Tom.

374
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,520
If you must know,
I fancy getting away for a bit.

375
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,580
Oh. Like Lord Gillingham,

376
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,580
thinking his way around
the Highlands.

377
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,560
I like Scotland, me. At least,
I would if I'd ever been there.

378
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,560
Well, I've had a bellyful of heather
and no mistake.

379
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,500
Aren't you going to fight back,
Mrs Hughes?

380
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,660
Mr Green can think what he likes.

381
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,520
So you're glad
you're on your way to London?

382
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,480
It'll be all I can do to stop
singing when I get in the car.

383
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,620
Where do you live when you're there?
His lordship's got a set at Albany.

384
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,480
Is that handy for the West End?
You're joking.

385
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,560
Piccadilly one end,
Saville Row the other.

386
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,740
Oh, you lucky tyke.
I AM a lucky tyke.

387
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,640
Do you like London, Miss Baxter?
Not particularly.

388
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,720
I lived there at one time
but it didn't work for me.

389
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,700
What about you, Anna? Do you fancy
a taste of Mr Green's life?

390
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,500
I'm happy where I am, thank you.

391
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,520
Rose was badgering me
about going up to London again

392
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,740
but she's been enough lately,
don't you think? I certainly do.

393
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,520
After all, she's got to have
some novelty when we bring her out.

394
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,640
Quite right.
She can help with the bazaar.

395
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,580
That'll take her mind off things.

396
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,560
Trouble is, parenting an adult

397
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,720
- especially when it's someone
else's daughter -

398
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,640
is really a matter of
mutual agreement.

399
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,560
There's a limit to how much
one can simply forbid.

400
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,600
Sshh. Here she is.
Actually, I want a word with her.

401
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,700
Rose, darling. Can I drag you into
my room for a moment?

402
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,600
Anna, could you leave us
for a minute?

403
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,500
Of course.

404
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,540
This is early for you to go to bed.
I had rather a tiring day.

405
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,740
So I heard.

406
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,520
Well, I heard you had
an interesting day.

407
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,700
Whether or not it was tiring,
you know better than I.

408
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,660
Who told you?

409
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,640
My dear, all I want is for you
not to lose control of your life.

410
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,560
I love him.

411
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,680
And I won't listen to any
imperialist nonsense

412
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,560
about racial purity

413
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,520
and how he should be horsewhipped
for daring to dream.

414
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,520
Don't you know me better than that?

415
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,720
I'm going to marry him, Mary.

416
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,640
I don't care what it costs
and I won't keep it a secret.

417
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,600
Not once I've told Mummy.

418
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,680
I want to see her face crumble
when she finds out.

419
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,620
Rose!

420
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,420
I feel we're driving you away.

421
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh, hardly. We're in grave danger
of outstaying our welcome.

422
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,620
If Tony hadn't offered us a lift
we'd be here forever.

423
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,580
I hope you'll be back soon.
Good luck with your bazaar.

424
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,540
Can't you stay and lend me a hand?
Don't tempt me.

425
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm so grateful for your advice
and wisdom.

426
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,400
And not least for the very practical
and muddy pig rescue.

427
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,580
Glad to be of service, m'lady.

428
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,380
Are you going straight there?
We might stop for some lunch...

429
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,640
It's kind of you
to give them a lift.

430
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,560
Pure self interest. I couldn't leave
Charles here, alone with you.

431
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,400
Will you let me see you
when you're next down south?

432
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,500
What would be the point, Tony?

433
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,460
I'm never going to be your mistress.

434
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
That's not me at all.

435
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,640
I've made up my mind
to call off the engagement.

436
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,540
Does Mabel know?
Not yet.

437
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,580
I haven't been in London since...
and I must tell her face to face.

438
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,540
Of course you must, but I wish
you'd think seriously before you do.

439
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,620
You mean you're going to
turn me down again.

440
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,540
I've told you
I'm not on the market, Tony.

441
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,580
I'm not free.

442
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,620
Sometimes I almost wish I were,
but I'm not.

443
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
And that's all there is to it.

444
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,460
Oh, you have been incredibly kind
to put up with us for so long.

445
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,620
We'll miss you.
The house will seem rather empty.

446
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,600
If it were my choice,
I should never be away from here.

447
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,440
Can I ask you one thing?
How do you feel about your man?

448
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,400
I'm still not very keen on him.
Why?

449
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,640
We'd better get started.
So, this really is goodbye.

450
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,580
Not for long, I hope.

451
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,480
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

452
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,600
I'm sorry to see them go.
Not as sorry as Mary.

453
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,560
What's a group noun for suitors?

454
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,580
What do you think? A desire?

455
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,440
A desire of suitors. Very good.

456
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,480
If you're going to talk nonsense,
I have better things to do.

457
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,480
I've posted the letter.
Well, he'll probably still come.

458
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,500
He's got to be in Yorkshire for
the funeral, whatever you said.

459
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
Whatever she said to who?

460
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,580
Oh, just tell me.
I know you've got a secret,

461
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,580
and if you're trying to spare
my feelings it's not working.

462
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,520
Alfred's written.

463
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,380
His father's died,
so he's coming for the burial.

464
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,560
He wants to look in and see us all.
See us all, or see her?

465
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,500
Alfred's asked me to marry him.
But she's turned him down.

466
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,500
So his heart's broken properly
this time. Are you satisfied now?

467
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,500
Why don't we leave the subject
there? We don't want to fall out.

468
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,640
We can't fall out,
we've never fallen in!

469
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
So they got off in good order.

470
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,420
I wonder how long it'll take
for them all to propose to Mary.

471
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,500
Isn't Lord Gillingham engaged?

472
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,500
He's supposed to be, but he still
seems as keen as mustard.

473
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,420
Well, that is very interesting.

474
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,560
But it's not why I asked you here.

475
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
Oh?
No.

476
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,580
I want to know what you were doing
at Downton.

477
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,540
I don't understand.

478
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,580
Why shouldn't I come to Downton?
I grew up here.

479
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,520
I see I'll have to take
the slow path.

480
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,520
You telephone to say
Edith is to be cherished,

481
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,400
but you don't say why.

482
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,440
Didn't I?
No.

483
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,460
Next, you invite yourself to Downton
and reveal at dinner

484
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,540
that you and Edith are retreating
to the continent for several months

485
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,460
so you can improve your French.
Yes.

486
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,580
Rosamund has no interest in French.

487
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,420
If she wishes to be understood
by a foreigner, she shouts.

488
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,520
That's not fair.

489
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,440
Isn't it time
one of you told me the truth?

490
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,400
If I told you the truth, Granny,
you would never speak to me again.

491
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
Then you HAVE told me the truth.

492
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,640
But I would like to hear it
enunciated more clearly.

493
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,420
Right. Now, we must all look lively.

494
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,420
They're starting to set up
the stalls for the bazaar today

495
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,500
and her ladyship will need
all hands on deck.

496
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,580
James, Mr Molesley, if you could
both keep an eye on things.

497
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,580
Do we get paid extra?
No,

498
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,620
but if you play your cards right,
you'll avoid a clip round the ear.

499
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,480
I'll ask Mrs Patmore for some
refreshment for the village people.

500
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,540
This is an early warning
that they're coming to set up
the stalls for Saturday,

501
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,440
so we'd better have sandwiches
and beer at the ready.

502
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,600
As I feared. Alfred's looking in on
Saturday on his way back to London.

503
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
So he'll be here for the bazaar.

504
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,420
He does know
there's no hope with Ivy?

505
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,540
Well, that's why he's written to me.
But he says he wants to see her.

506
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,580
It's not going to be very easy
for Daisy.

507
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,400
I thought I'd give her the day off.
You won't mind, will you?

508
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:54,560
If you think it best. It's you
who'll do the extra work, not me.

509
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,460
What a nightmare.

510
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,460
The man selling ices is ill
so I've got to find another.

511
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,460
The grocers from Easingwold
and Malton can't be side by side,

512
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,440
and I've got to decide
the house menus with Mrs Patmore.

513
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,420
I'll do that. Tend to the bazaar.

514
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,400
Are you sure? Because if you are...
I'm sure.

515
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,460
When's Cousin Robert coming back?
I don't know. I wish I did.

516
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,400
We've had no word from him in days.

517
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,400
What is it?

518
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,580
I've got to tell someone,
or I'll just explode.

519
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Tell someone what?
Oh, Mary.

520
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,640
What do you think?

521
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,440
I'm engaged!

522
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,480
But what was so urgent?

523
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,620
First,
can you join me for luncheon today?

524
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,620
Well, I suppose so. I ought to go
back and tell Mrs Field. Why?

525
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,520
I've got Lord Merton coming.

526
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,480
Mary's Godfather?

527
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,480
Mm. It was fixed years ago,
but now Robert's off on his travels,

528
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,560
Cora is too busy...
and Mary's chucked.

529
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,480
For what reason?
Suddenly she has to be in London.

530
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,500
I think Rosamund's still here.
Oh, no, she can't stand him.

531
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,540
I could ask Edith.
She might be free.

532
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,620
Oh, I hope so.

533
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,560
I'm a feeble substitute
for the entire Crawley family.

534
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,620
Mmm, yes,
but you're better than nothing.

535
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,580
How warming you make that sound.

536
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,580
Oh, I'm ever so glad to find you.
Can you help me do these?

537
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,540
What's the rush?

538
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,620
Lady Mary has to go to London.

539
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,440
Why?
I'm not sure.

540
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,520
But she wants me to go with her.
Of course.

541
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,420
When will you be back?
Tomorrow evening, but we'll be late.

542
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,400
It's not fair.

543
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,460
I stop you going to New York
and then I set off for London.

544
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,600
Don't be silly.

545
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,500
Come in.

546
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,440
Mr Carson, I'd like to go into York
tomorrow. I hope you don't mind.

547
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,420
You've got no duties here.
Why should I mind?

548
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,380
I'll set off first thing,
if you've no objection.

549
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Be my guest, Mr Bates.

550
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,620
I still don't understand why
you're not in NEW York,

551
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,420
so I can hardly object to York.

552
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,520
Enjoy yourself.

553
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,480
Very good. Well done, ladies.

554
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,440
Can I have a go?
It's not ready yet.

555
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,480
Anyway, you're a bit of a shrimp,
aren't you?

556
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,640
I'm a shrimp with muscles, me.

557
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,440
We'll find that out on Saturday.

558
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,420
I've never had a go on one of those.
It's not your sort of thing.

559
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,580
More sandwiches and more beer.
It's like a plague of locusts.

560
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,580
Busy, Mr Molesley?
I like the bazaar.

561
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,580
I always enjoy it. I hope you will.

562
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,580
Can't you help her to, Mr Molesley?

563
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,400
Oh, get off with you,
you cheeky devil.

564
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,540
Alfred's coming Saturday, in't he?
How do you know that?

565
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,580
I heard you and Mrs Hughes talking.
Well I, I were going to mention it,

566
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,560
because I wondered
if you'd rather be away.

567
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,580
What about all the work?
Oh, it's mostly done by then.

568
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,580
If you'd rather avoid him,
I won't mind.

569
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,540
Could I go and see Mr Mason?

570
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,420
That's a good idea.

571
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,520
Stay away as late as you like.
Just to be safe.

572
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,480
But why the urgency?

573
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,580
I can't explain, but I swear
if you knew, you'd approve.

574
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,380
What this? What's happened?
Mary has to go to London.

575
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,460
It's no big thing.
I'll be back tomorrow night.

576
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,580
Can I come?
No.

577
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,620
Well, why not?
Because Mama needs you here.

578
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,640
Goodbye, then. Bye, Rose.

579
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,580
Do you want to stay at the house?
I'll telephone if you do.

580
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,420
Could you? You're an angel.

581
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,620
I told Mead he could visit
his sister in Swindon,

582
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,600
but they'll do the best they can.
Thank you.

583
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,400
How mysterious.

584
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,580
Is anything wrong?

585
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,480
The car's packed in,
my friend's gone for help.

586
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,440
Would you like me to have a look?
I don't want to hold you up.

587
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,560
I've no appointment.
I was on my way to Skipton

588
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,560
to see some suppliers
and compare prices.

589
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,460
How impressive.

590
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,420
I thought that when the agent
was a cousin or son-in-law,

591
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,640
he had free shooting for life,
but others did the work.

592
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,520
To quote my wife's grandmother,

593
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,380
you've been reading
Socialist newspapers again.

594
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,560
You should know.

595
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,440
Is this wise?

596
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,560
You've heard some of my story,
but not all of it.

597
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,620
I came to Downton
to be the chauffeur.

598
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Now...

599
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,620
That was a splendid luncheon.

600
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Quite a change for me.
Oh, I can't believe that.

601
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,480
It's true.
I eat nothing but nursery food.

602
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,620
Perhaps you need a new cook.
It's not her fault.

603
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,500
I never know what to order.

604
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,460
A husband is told so often
he's going to die first,

605
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,460
you never think you're going to
have to manage on your own.

606
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,520
I doubt Doctor Crawley
would have managed any better.

607
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,460
I'm so interested he was a doctor.

608
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,540
I wanted to study medicine myself,
but my father didn't really...

609
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,420
Didn't see it as a profession
for a gentleman.

610
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,540
I don't believe he'd have gone that
far.

611
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,640
But he didn't think it
quite suitable for a peer, no.

612
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,520
I must try and find an example
to rebut that.

613
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,520
Well, I must be going.

614
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,580
Let me take you. My car's outside.

615
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,440
I can easily walk.

616
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,480
I'd like to. Please.

617
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,540
Then...thank you.

618
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,460
I should go too, Granny.

619
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,460
No. Stay.

620
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,440
I want to speak to you.

621
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,440
So were you still the chauffeur
when you married?

622
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,580
That's a long story.

623
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,540
Everything with you's a long story.

624
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
That one had a happy ending.

625
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,640
For a time, anyway.

626
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,440
I know she died.

627
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I'm so sorry.

628
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,520
She must have been a very unusual
and independent person.

629
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,620
You could say that again.

630
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,560
It's nice that they asked you
to stay, to make your life here.

631
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
I have a little daughter,
and it seemed the right thing.

632
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,460
Still, it makes me take
a kinder view of the family.

633
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,420
Oh? What do you have against them?

634
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,540
Nothing.

635
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,540
But, as a rule,
I don't really warm to their type.

636
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,580
I don't believe in types.

637
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,640
I believe in people.

638
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Now give it a try.

639
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,400
I really am very grateful.
Thank you.

640
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,540
I don't often say it,

641
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,620
but Rosamund is right.

642
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
I do not know this Mr...Mr Drewe,...

643
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,440
..but even if he is everything
you say,

644
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,540
to keep the child here

645
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,540
would be like a permanent sword of
Damocles, inches from your head.

646
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,400
But I can't bear the thought
of giving it away.

647
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,600
And is it right
that it should grow up Swiss?

648
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:15,440
Well, Switzerland
has everything to offer,...

649
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
..except perhaps conversation.

650
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,440
And one can learn to live
without that.

651
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,580
And if Michael turns up?

652
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,460
Well, if you want my advice,
start again.

653
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,580
Now, I will pay for everything.

654
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,440
Aunt Rosamund said she would.

655
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
You'll be quite enough in her debt
as it is.

656
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,460
Take any more,

657
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,420
and she'll start exacting
annual tribute.

658
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,460
What do your sons do?
I assume they do something.

659
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,420
Remember I met Larry at that dinner?

660
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,400
Ah, don't remind me.

661
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,460
They do work.

662
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,540
Larry's in banking
and Tim's in the diplomatic,

663
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,520
so nothing very startling there.
What about yours?

664
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,420
Matthew was a lawyer.

665
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,600
Oh, has he given it up?

666
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,520
He's...

667
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,460
He's dead.

668
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,540
I thought you would know that.

669
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Oh, good God.

670
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,380
I'm terribly sorry. I... I'd
forgotten for a moment who you were.

671
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,520
Don't worry. Please.

672
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,460
How is Mary? I do wish
I could have seen her today.

673
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,480
Well, slow to start with, but now
she's on her way, which I'm glad of.

674
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,580
I heard they were well suited.
Yes.

675
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,420
They were happy,
which makes the parting worse,

676
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,600
but gives you strength in the end,
as we know.

677
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,560
You maybe. Not me.

678
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,500
Lady Merton and I were not exactly
meant to be together.

679
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,420
We struggled on, of course,
as everyone did in those days,

680
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,480
but I'm not sure now
how sensible it was.

681
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,520
I envy you, your wonderful memories,
but I can't pretend to match them.

682
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,600
Is Mr Ross here yet?

683
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:24,460
Who shall I say is calling?
Rose's cousin.

684
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,400
? Da-da-da-da-da

685
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,540
? Da-da-da-da

686
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,540
? Da-ba-da-ba-da

687
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,460
? Da-da-da-da

688
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,540
? Da-da-da-da

689
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,520
? Da-da-dee-dee-dee

690
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,420
? Da-da-da-da

691
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,520
? Da-da- ?

692
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,460
Lady Mary. Huh.

693
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,580
I was wondering if it would be you.

694
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,540
How did you know
someone was coming?

695
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,540
Rose telephoned.

696
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,560
She said she'd told you
we were about to set the date.

697
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,620
I just made some tea.
Would you like a cup?

698
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,400
Thank you.

699
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,420
I suppose you're here to say that
Lord Flintshire

700
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,540
would find the prospect of
a black son-in-law preposterous.

701
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,520
And your father would agree.

702
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,600
To be fair to Papa,
he'd find your being a band singer

703
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,460
even harder to swallow
than your colour.

704
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,560
Mr Ross, are you sure about this?

705
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,460
Marriage is a challenge,
even when everyone wants it.

706
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,580
Even if everyone prays
you'll be happy.

707
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,540
You mean in our case, they'll all be
trying to pull us apart.

708
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,400
Every hour of every day.

709
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,440
Tell me, do you think she loves you?

710
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,420
Don't you believe in us?

711
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,560
I believe in you.
I'm not so sure about her.

712
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,420
She may love you a bit,
but mostly I'd say

713
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,600
she wants to shock her mother,
whom incidentally, she hates.

714
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,560
That's what my mother said.

715
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,600
She said Rose
must be proving some point.

716
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,640
You and my mother
have a lot in common.

717
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,540
Tell me honestly: Do you think you
can survive what they'll do to you?

718
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,540
Because I don't believe Rose could.

719
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,580
It may come as something
of a relief for you to hear that

720
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,420
I will not be marrying Rose.

721
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,440
You won't?
No.

722
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,540
I've enjoyed her dreams.

723
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,520
I think she's more than you allow.

724
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,500
But?

725
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,440
I don't want to spoil her life.

726
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,560
I don't want to watch
while people point at her and jeer.

727
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
I love her.

728
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,600
I want her to be happy.

729
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,420
So you'll end it?

730
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,580
Yes.

731
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,600
I should probably have stopped it
sooner, but at any rate,...

732
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,420
..I'm stopping it now.

733
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,500
So will you tell Rose, or shall I?
I'll tell her.

734
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,640
I'll write to her.

735
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,580
She'll get it tomorrow.

736
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,560
It doesn't mean I think it's right.

737
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:28,560
I wouldn't give in if we lived in
even a slightly better world.

738
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,500
It may surprise you, Mr Ross,

739
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,580
but if we lived in a better world,
I wouldn't want you to.

740
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,500
I've been downstairs, m'lady.
They're making dinner for you now.

741
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,640
I don't want a lot.
I've told them that.

742
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,640
How are you?

743
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,520
Much as I was yesterday.

744
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,420
Much as I will be tomorrow.

745
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,500
Anna,

746
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,540
I've decided to see
Lord Gillingham.

747
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,500
I'm sorry, but I must do something.

748
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,380
I'll telephone
and suggest we meet for luncheon.

749
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,560
Then I'll ask him straight out
to dismiss his valet.

750
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,460
I won't say why.

751
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,460
That makes me so nervous.
Don't be.

752
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,540
No-one needs to know the reason.

753
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:40,580
Green simply won't be back
at Downton again.

754
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,640
Is Bates going to challenge
Lord Gillingham

755
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,560
as to why he has a different valet?

756
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,500
I suppose not.

757
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,440
So you have nothing to fear
if he pays us a visit.

758
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,440
And will he, m'lady?

759
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,440
Er, dinner's on the table, m'lady.

760
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,580
I'm not sure Mead would have put it
like that, but thank you.

761
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,420
So, we decorate the stalls today.
You all know the drill.

762
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,420
And remember,

763
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,500
anything shabby
shows Downton in a bad light.

764
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,640
And we can't have that.
No, Mrs Hughes, we can't.

765
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,560
Will you come?

766
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:36,540
It'll give you a chance to meet
a few people from the village.

767
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,400
Is it not just the estate workers?
Oh, no, no.

768
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,520
The whole area gets behind
the Church bazaar.

769
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,580
You're very lucky, you know.

770
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,500
Nobody's ever called me that.
Least of all myself.

771
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,500
To grow up in a village where
people know and like you,

772
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:56,560
where your family's respected.
Plenty would give an eye for that.

773
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,540
I'm not used to feeling lucky.

774
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,400
Well, you should be.

775
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,460
Are we trying for a colour scheme?

776
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,580
Goodness, I thought I'd be down
before anyone.

777
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,380
Oh, no. This is one task
that demands an early start.

778
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,580
The tent's up for the tea.
They're fetching tables and chairs
from the barn.

779
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,560
Don't let them mess up the grass
when they drive them back.

780
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,640
Rose!
One, two, three, lift.

781
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,620
Oh!
I can manage.

782
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,420
Rose...
Should you be doing this?

783
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,460
Why? What are you afraid of?
That I'll lose the baby?

784
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,500
So they've made you
a beast of burden now?

785
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,400
That's right.
And they're not taking advantage?

786
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,580
Are they ready for these?
Give me those. James!

787
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,420
Could you take these to the tent,
please?

788
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,420
May I present Miss Bunting?

789
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,560
She teaches at the village school.
I'm very interested in the school.

790
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,560
You know Lady Grantham?

791
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,420
Of course.
It's nice to meet you,

792
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,440
but I'm afraid I must get on.

793
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,380
So that's the great Countess
of Grantham.

794
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,400
It is. Another beast of burden.

795
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,560
I'll sack him if you insist,
but tell me why. It's only fair.

796
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,480
I don't know if it's fair
or unfair, but I can't.

797
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,520
Not even a hint?
I've said what I can.

798
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,560
He's done something
you'd find...abhorrent.

799
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,440
Well, you win.

800
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,520
But it does seem mean,
even if I don't like him very much.

801
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:53,460
You wouldn't think it mean
if you knew the truth.

802
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Well, I believe you.

803
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,640
I love you and I believe you.

804
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,440
Have you spoken to Mabel?

805
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,620
I have.
But I wasn't going to bring it up.

806
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,420
Why not?
I don't want to twist your arm.

807
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,540
And I know that you won't make
a decision until it suits you.

808
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,540
How did she take it?
I'm so pleased you asked.

809
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,560
I think the answer is
with real style.

810
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,520
Well, I'm glad.

811
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,620
And now, can you get the bill?
I'm terribly late.

812
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,600
I must catch the last train.
It's the Church bazaar tomorrow.

813
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,460
I won't give up, Mary.

814
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,540
Not until you walk down the aisle
with another man,

815
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,480
and very possibly not even then.

816
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:42,500
I find that both irritating
and beguiling in equal measure.

817
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,440
Should I take comfort from that?
Take what you like.

818
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
I'm going.

819
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,520
And do what I ask with Green,...

820
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,400
..and please let me know
when you've done it.

821
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,900
You sent for me?

822
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,880
I wouldn't put it like that.

823
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,780
I just wondered if you might be free.

824
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,680
Oh. Your wish is my command.

825
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,800
These came this morning
from Lord Merton. As a thank you.

826
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,820
That was kind of him.
But what part do I play in it?

827
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
They're for you.

828
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,800
For me? Surely not.

829
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:40,940
Yes, he sent me some too,
these came with them.

830
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:43,860
I read the card.

831
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:48,700
He asks forgiveness
for his tactlessness.

832
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,860
Was he tactless?
He didn't mean to be tactless.

833
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,820
How nice.
Mmm.

834
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,780
Very nice.

835
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,940
Quite...quite surprising,
but very nice.

836
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,920
I'm just going up
to see if they need anything more.

837
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,740
Can you leave these
for one of the hall boys?

838
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,860
I'll do them, Mr Carson.
I don't mind.

839
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,740
You took your time in York.

840
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,700
Yes, it was quite a long day.

841
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,820
What were you up to?
Oh, this and that.

842
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,820
One, two, three, go!

843
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,940
Lovely to see you again.
Thank you very much.

844
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,800
You got his letter, then?

845
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,740
You're so disappointing, Mary.

846
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,860
I thought you understood,
and you're just like my mother.

847
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,880
No, I'm not. But I understand this -

848
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,760
if you're going to complicate your
life, do it for the right reasons.

849
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,780
James, I'm putting the tea tent
in your charge.

850
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
Make sure they don't
run out of anything.

851
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,700
But her ladyship said
we were to enjoy ourselves.

852
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,880
Let us consider this.

853
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,680
She wants you to enjoy yourself,
I want you to run the tent.

854
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,860
Now, which of us can make your life
more uncomfortable?

855
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,820
Mr Molesley.

856
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,740
Mr Molesley! Mr Molesley!

857
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,720
Tell those people
where they're supposed to park.

858
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,720
Wait a minute. It's his lordship!
His lordship's back!

859
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,820
Tell the others!
His lordship's back!

860
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,900
James!

861
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,760
How can you be here?!

862
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,700
Why didn't you send a message?

863
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,880
We would have made such a fuss!
You're a beast!

864
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,840
Oh, not quite a beast, I hope.

865
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,920
I wanted to surprise you
and I think I have.

866
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:15,800
Papa, you should have let us know!
When did you get in?

867
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,880
This morning.
I'd forgotten about the bazaar.

868
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,840
I was right not to distract you all
from your labours.

869
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,700
What happened to Uncle Harold?
A reprimand, but nothing more.

870
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,880
So it was worth your going.

871
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,800
I don't think I made
a bit of difference,
but let's hold on to that fiction.

872
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,940
How was it?
Interesting.

873
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,920
Very modern...and very interesting.

874
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,760
How's it been here?

875
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,820
Not very interesting
and not very modern.

876
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,760
Carson.
Hello, Bates. Have you missed me?

877
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,760
Because I've certainly missed you.

878
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,780
Good to see you back, m'lord.

879
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:54,900
You're back.

880
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,900
I can't believe it.

881
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,940
If you knew how many times
I'd imagined this scene.

882
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,700
This is a treat. It's been a while.

883
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,800
I'm sorry if I've stayed away.

884
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,840
Nay, no apologies. Not from you.
Not here.

885
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,880
You're my daughter-in-law,

886
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,860
you're all that I've got left
of my son.

887
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,720
Whether you come here or not,
this is your home.

888
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,860
I do love it when I come.
I'm glad.

889
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,800
That's it.

890
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,800
Oh, there you are, Alfred. Nice
to see you. Have a glass of this.

891
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,820
Is Ivy about?
I'm just here.

892
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,700
Thank you.

893
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,680
How was the funeral?
Was well attended.

894
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,760
So that's something
for my mother to hold on to.

895
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,860
I read your letter.

896
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,720
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
No, I'm sorry.

897
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,860
I got the wrong end of the stick
when I were last up here,

898
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,740
but it were my mistake.

899
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,700
All you did was...try and give me
a nice welcome,

900
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,740
and you can't feel sorry for that.

901
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,920
We can part as friends?

902
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,820
We can, as far as I'm concerned.

903
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,840
Is Daisy here?

904
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,700
I wanted to see if she and I could
be friends an' all before I go.

905
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
She's gone to Mr Mason's farm
for the day.

906
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,740
She won't be back till late.
Oh.

907
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,760
Daisy, are you here
to avoid seeing Alfred?

908
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,880
Ivy's turned him down again,
so he won't come back after today.

909
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,760
What does Mrs Patmore say about it?

910
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,820
To stay away so I don't meet him.

911
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:56,780
I would advise against that.
But why?

912
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,880
I thought you'd be glad
if I stayed a bit longer.

913
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,920
I wish you'd stay and never leave,
and I hope you will one day,

914
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,760
but Mrs Patmore's wrong.

915
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,780
Daisy, there won't be too many people
that you love in your life,

916
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,760
and he's one.

917
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,720
I don't know what I feel about him.
Not now.

918
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,680
Even so, you need to say goodbye
to this young man,

919
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,680
with nothing jagged,

920
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,880
nothing harsh, between you.

921
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,800
I couldn't think of the words.

922
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,860
We'll find them together.

923
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,880
And er, we'll get you back to Downton
in time.

924
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:37,760
Are you bearing up?

925
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,800
In here.

926
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm never going to see Michael again,
am I?

927
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:46,840
If you want to go out there
and look for him, I'll support you.

928
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,940
They've already done all that.

929
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,840
Police and private detectives
and everything.

930
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,940
Well, then you must be patient.

931
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,760
Sometimes I feel that God
doesn't want me to be happy.

932
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,920
My dear, all life
is a series of problems

933
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:02,720
which we must try and solve.

934
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:05,860
First one, then the next,
and the next,...

935
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,940
..until at last we die.

936
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:15,840
Why don't you get us an ice cream?

937
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:18,900
Yes. That should sort it out.

938
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:35,840
Isn't that Lord Gillingham?
What? It can't be. Where?

939
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,880
What does Miss Lane Fox think
about it? That's what I wonder.

940
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,760
I agree. He's the most unconvincing
fiance I've ever come across.

941
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,840
Perhaps she doesn't know.

942
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,940
If we know, she knows.
You can count on that.

943
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,880
Green. But how could he be dead?

944
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,720
I'm only telling you what they told
me.

945
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,880
That he was in Piccadilly and he...

946
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,880
slipped or stumbled
and fell into the road.

947
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:06,940
I don't know what to say.

948
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,920
It just seemed so odd
after our conversation yesterday

949
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,860
that I felt that I should...
bring you the news myself.

950
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,900
Can you explain to me now
why you wanted him sacked?

951
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,940
No.

952
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,680
Hello, Tony. Heavens,

953
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:27,880
what a gathering of the clans
today's turning out to be.

954
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,800
Would you excuse me for a moment?

955
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,820
I don't suppose it's a good sign
to find you back at Downton?

956
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,800
Not really. Not this time.

957
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:46,360
You mean he fell into the road
and he was hit? Yesterday?

958
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,460
By a bus or lorry, apparently.

959
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,520
And someone saw this?

960
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,500
The pavement was crowded.
Lots of people saw it.

961
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,340
That's a relief.
What do you mean?

962
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:07,380
Nothing. I don't mean anything.

963
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,360
Mary!

964
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,520
Did your mother warn you
I was coming?

965
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,520
She did.

966
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,540
Why are you back in Yorkshire
so soon?

967
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,440
I'd no sooner got back than I was
despatched to a tenant farmers'
convention in Whitby.

968
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:24,360
But it's over now,
so I'll go home from here.

969
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,360
Can I ask you something?
Of course.

970
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,380
It's an odd question.
Go on.

971
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:35,340
If you thought a man was involved
in a crime, or an incident,

972
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,440
but you didn't blame him,

973
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,520
in fact you thought right
was on his side,

974
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,520
what would you do?

975
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:45,440
It's a bit theoretical
for an opinion.

976
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,520
But you don't believe he was wrong?
No.

977
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:53,440
Well, I'm guessing in the dark,
but...I suspect I would say nothing.

978
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,540
That isn't fair. It's weighted.

979
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,400
Go on. You have a go, Mr Molesley.

980
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,420
No, no, I won't manage it
if Jimmy can't.

981
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,460
Try. I want to see it.

982
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:24,400
Well done!

983
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,440
That was cheating.

984
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,540
Well, it...it's in the arms.

985
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,540
It's all to do with the swing,
and the swing is in the arms.

986
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,360
So, Miss Baxter,

987
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,520
anything to tell me about life
since I've been away?

988
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:43,340
No. Nothing's happened.

989
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,400
I'll find out if it has, you know.

990
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,300
Leave her alone, Mr Barrow.

991
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,400
We don't want any bullying
brought back from overseas.

992
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,360
Do we, Miss Baxter?

993
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,340
Now, are there any stalls
you'd still like to see?

994
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,500
God, what a relief
to be able to drink in public

995
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,520
without a policeman pouncing.
Down with Prohibition.

996
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,360
You can't mean you never had
a drink all the time you were there.

997
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,440
Harold has his uses.

998
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,440
I suppose he does.

999
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:28,320
And let us hope
they both leave us in peace.

1000
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,320
A slim hope, I'm afraid.

1001
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:33,440
Martha wants to bring him over next
summer for Rose's coming out ball.

1002
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,480
Why?

1003
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,280
She says she wants to see another
London Season before she dies.

1004
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,360
Oh!

1005
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,440
You're still here. Thank goodness.

1006
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:55,440
I caught an early bus, but it was
delayed. I thought I'd missed you.

1007
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,460
I'm off to the station now, Daisy.

1008
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,320
And I won't be back.

1009
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:03,360
My dad's gone and mother's moving
to Crewe to be nearer my sister,

1010
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,520
so I'm glad you're here
to say goodbye. I really am.

1011
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,460
I've brought you a present.

1012
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,460
Mr Mason's made you
a basket full of things.

1013
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,420
Rolls and cheese and ham,
and jams and pickles,

1014
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,520
and he's put some cider in too,
to keep you going on the train home.

1015
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,480
That was kind of him, Daisy. Are you
sure it wasn't meant for you?

1016
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,400
No, he did it for Alfred.

1017
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:25,400
I told him we were old friends,
so he did it for you.

1018
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,360
You know Ivy turned me down?
I do, yes.

1019
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:37,540
I think I've been a bit blind
where she's concerned.

1020
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,400
Love is blind.

1021
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:42,460
Maybe. But I wonder now
I've not been a fool.

1022
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,280
You've always been so good to me,
Daisy. So true.

1023
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:47,500
But I could never see it.

1024
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:51,360
That's kind of you to say,
and good to hear.

1025
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,480
I loved you, Alfred.
I'll not deny it.

1026
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,480
But that's done with now,
and what I felt won't come back.

1027
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,380
It's time for you to go your way
and me to go mine.

1028
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:06,480
But you wish me well?
Oh, I do, Alfred, yeah.

1029
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,320
So well. So very well.

1030
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,520
Friends forever.

1031
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Friends forever, Daisy.

1032
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,520
Right, now this really is goodbye.

1033
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,480
Are you all right, Daisy?

1034
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,420
I'll just get this off
and pop in the pantry for my apron.

1035
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,540
Well, that's that, then.

1036
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,420
Do you know,
when you brought up that basket,...

1037
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,320
..I were so proud of you,
I felt like crying out.

1038
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,360
If you were my own daughter,

1039
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:13,360
I couldn't be prouder than I am now.

1040
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:34,440
You do know why I came today.
To see the bazaar.

1041
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,400
To see you.

1042
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,500
I find - perhaps to my surprise -
that since I left,

1043
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,480
I can't think of anything but you.

1044
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,340
To your surprise and my surprise.

1045
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,320
I'm only asking for a chance.

1046
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,500
Was there really a conference
in Whitby?

1047
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,380
Of course not.

1048
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,420
I'm flattered, Charles,
and even moved.

1049
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:04,520
But rather than add to the list
of men I've disappointed,

1050
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:09,460
it might be kinder to refuse you now
and let you off the hook.

1051
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,440
Hmm,
I'm afraid I couldn't allow that.

1052
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,420
Not without putting up a fight.

1053
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,400
What are you still doing here?

1054
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:36,440
I wish I knew what you were up to
yesterday.

1055
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,340
Why did you go?
I wanted to get away.

1056
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,500
You'd never do anything foolish,
would you?

1057
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,340
You'd never risk everything
we've built together?

1058
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,380
Certainly not. You know me.

1059
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,420
When I do a thing, I like to have
a very good reason for doing it.

1060
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,480
Where have you two been hiding?

1061
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,320
In plain view,
where all good tricksters hide.

1062
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,320
Look what I've found.
Tom, will you see

1063
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,480
if there are some clean glasses
on that table?

1064
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:21,300
Well done, my dear. A real triumph.

1065
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,460
I hope so.

1066
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,440
I've told them
they can clear up the rest tomorrow.

1067
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:29,360
I thought that was the best bazaar
I've known here.

1068
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,500
Certainly. At least since
your father and I were running it.

1069
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,280
And now, as the Prodigal Husband
home from the sea,

1070
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,520
let me raise a glass
to my extraordinary wife

1071
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,340
who can clearly manage far better
in my absence. Cora.

1072
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,380
Lady Grantham.
Cora. Mama.

1073
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,360
Very well done, Lady Grantham. And
now, I'm afraid, I should be going.

1074
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,300
It was so kind of you to come.

1075
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,380
I don't suppose I could ask YOU
for a lift this time? I came by train

1076
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,360
but I'd much rather drive.
Certainly.

1077
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,380
I'll see you off.

1078
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,540
What sort of menage has that
turned into while I've been away?

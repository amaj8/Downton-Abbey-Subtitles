1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Oh, heavens.

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,020
This is nice. It's from Gwen.

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,040
She's married.

4
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,120
Who's Gwen? She used to work as a
housemaid here.

5
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,200
She left to be a secretary.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,080
That's her ladyship for you, Miss
Braithwaite.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,120
She says they kept it very quiet
because his mother's ill

8
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,180
but she hopes she can introduce us to
him in due course.

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,020
Well, I think it's lovely.

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,240
We should send her a card. I'll get
one and we can all sign it.

11
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,060
Sorry. I nearly forgot this.
No harm done.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,100
How are you finding it? Have that
lot got used to your promotion yet?

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,980
Some of them. But not all, eh?

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,020
I'll be fine. I don't need to have
everyone love me.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,000
Nor me. Which is just as well...

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Miss Braithwaite?

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,200
I hope you don't mind
but can I give you some advice?

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,140
Go on. Mr Barrow never bothered with
you when you were a housemaid but he
will now.

19
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,120
I should be friendly but keep him at
arms length if I were you.

20
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
I'd better get on.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,140
What do you think's in it?

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,100
I cannot say, James.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,000
It's addressed to Lady Mary so
perhaps you could question HER
later?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,240
Mr Carson?

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,140
You see the box has been delivered
from the late Mr Crawley's office?
Yes.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,040
Well, ought we to give it straight
to Lady Mary? Shouldn't someone else
see it first?

27
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,020
In case there's something in it
to make her cry.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,240
You may be right. I'll take it to
his lordship and he can decide.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,180
I say. Phyllis Dare's coming to the
Theatre Royal in York.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,020
Miss Dare will appear in The Lady Of
The Rose which was a hit musical of
the London season.

31
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,160
Who's Phyllis Dare?
Only one of the Dare sisters.

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,000
Zena and Phyllis Dare Up here in
York.

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,140
What happened to the other one.
She married the son of Lord Esher
then retired.

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,060
Oh, all right for some!

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
Have you truly never heard of them?
Why would I? I don't go to the
theatre.

36
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,020
You must have been sometimes?
No, I've never been.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,100
She's got better things to spend her
money on.

38
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,040
I don't understand you. Of course
you must give it to her.

39
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060
But what if it has no legal status?

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,080
I don't want to build her hopes up
only to have them dashed.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,100
Robert, Matthew intended Mary to be
his sole heiress.

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,060
That will mean a great deal to her
whether or not it's legal.

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,120
Can't you see that?
But is it right to exclude George?

44
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,120
Well, right or not,
it is what he wanted.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Besides, it's not up to you.

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,220
I'll send it to Murray.

47
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,080
Well, Mary must read it before you
send it anywhere.

48
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,140
Or are you trying to hide from the
truth?

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,000
What truth?

50
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,220
That you would prefer to be in sole
charge of the estate and not share
the crown with Mary.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,200
Don't be silly. This won't make any
difference to all that.

52
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,200
She won't want to get involved.

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:56,080
When you talk like that, I'm tempted
to ring for Nanny and have you put
to bed with no supper.

54
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,200
Goodbye, Mr Grigg.
Thank you, Doctor.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,020
All he needs to put him right
is some paid work.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,060
It's hard for a healthy young man to
find a job these days, never mind
poor old Mr Grigg.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,180
I know. Thank you.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,040
But Mrs Crawley has things in hand.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,240
My guess is that you knew what you
were doing bringing him here.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,020
Mrs Hughes? Won't you come up?

61
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh, don't get up for me.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,020
What news of Charlie?
Mr Carson is still very busy but he
sends his best wishes.

63
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,220
Does he?

64
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,040
How did he phrase that exactly?

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,120
Well, he... He said to tell you -
He didn't say nothing, did he?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,240
You have to understand, he doesn't
remember the days you spent
together with any great nostalgia.

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,000
He thinks it were all my fault...
but it weren't.

68
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,180
Meaning what?

69
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Never mind.

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
But it weren't my fault.

71
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,100
They're all coming tonight so we
have to stretch a dinner by two
places.

72
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,980
Why, suddenly?
I don't know, do I?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,120
Go on about Jimmy. I just want Ivy
to know he's not interested in her.

74
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,100
He pretends he is because he knows
it annoys me. How can you be so
sure?

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,000
He hasn't been bothered about her
before now, has he?

76
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,140
Sometimes people come around.

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,060
You hope.

78
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I thought the fish seller might be
in the village but he's not coming.

79
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,160
I'll have to go to Tuttles in York.
I can do it.

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,980
What? Go to York. You can tell Mr
Carson I'm there on your business.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,160
We don't know he can spare you.
He will if YOU ask him.

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Hello, Mr Molesley.

83
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,060
How are things? Well, as you can see,
not very good.

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,220
I don't agree. It's skilled work.

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,180
No, it isn't, not what I'm doing.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,140
I'm sure if you just wait something
better will turn up.

87
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,120
I have waited
and nothing's turned up.

88
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,160
I haven't earned a penny since Mr
Crawley died and now I owe money all
over the village.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,040
Yes, but surely with your -
Don't you understand? I'm at my
wits' end!

90
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,000
I apologise. I should not have said
that. It was vulgar and
self-important. Please, forgive me.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
How much do you owe?

92
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,160
What difference does it make? 15, 20
pounds.

93
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,160
More than I've any likelihood of.

94
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,200
Mr Molesley...

95
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,060
would it be useful if Mr Bates and I
lent you some money?

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,020
When would I pay it back?
Give it, then.

97
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,200
We'll give you some, if you like.
Not much but...but some.

98
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,240
I couldn't accept that...

99
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,180
..but I thank you, I do, most
sincerely.

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,120
Get back to work!

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
Anna said you wanted to see me
before I go down.

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,020
Yes. That is...
Thank you, Bates, that will be all.

103
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,180
You know I've invited Granny
and Isobel to dinner. I didn't but -

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,980
Well, the thing is...

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,080
There is a letter for you from
Matthew.

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,020
What? Where was it?

107
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,080
Hidden in a book in the office and
so it was overlooked.

108
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,080
They finally got round to packing up
his things and brought them here
this morning.

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,240
Who opened it?
It wasn't sealed.

110
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,060
But you've read it before me? Yes.

111
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,140
I would have sent it to Murray to
have it looked into

112
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,040
but your grandmother insisted you
should see it first.

113
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,060
Granny's read it too? And what do
you mean, 'To have it looked into?'

114
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,220
Read it. Then you'll understand.

115
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,020
I felt so sorry for him. To be in
debt like that is the worst thing.

116
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,160
Molesley's not having much luck.

117
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,040
But if he won't accept help then...
I don't know.

118
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,140
I'm really upset by it.

119
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
Well, we can't have that.

120
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,140
I don't understand.

121
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,220
Did Matthew leave instructions after
all?

122
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,060
He left a letter. He wrote it before
we went to Scotland.

123
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,160
Well, where has it been?
Concealed in a book. They only
dropped off today.

124
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Papa, you read it.

125
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,100
My darling Mary, we are off to
Duneagle in the morning

126
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,100
and I have suddenly realised that
I've never made a will or anything
like one,

127
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,100
which seems pretty feeble for a
lawyer and you being pregnant makes
it even more irresponsible.

128
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Hm, I'm afraid I have to agree with
that.

129
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,160
I'll do it properly when I get back
and tear this up before you ever see
it

130
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,080
but I'll feel easier that I've
recorded on paper that I wish YOU to
be my sole heiress.

131
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,140
What?

132
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,180
I cannot know if our baby is a boy
or a girl but I do know it will be a
baby,

133
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,220
if anything happens to me before
I've drawn up a will

134
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,180
and so you must take charge.

135
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,040
And now I shall sign this and get
off home for dinner with you.

136
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,040
What a lovely, lovely thought.
Matthew.

137
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Now you see
why I didn't want to read it.

138
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,080
But surely it must be legal or do
there have to be witnesses?

139
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,060
But it was witnessed by two of his
clients, which is why no-one in the
office knew it existed.

140
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Then it's settled. Nothing is
settled.

141
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,080
This is why I wanted Murray to check
it first.

142
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,040
Whatever Matthew's intentions, it is
not a will.

143
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,120
I've explained to Mr Carson about
the fish and he says you can go.

144
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,000
Thanks.

145
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,240
A pound to a penny he's got some
trick up his sleeve. You're so
suspicious.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,140
There are two reasons why he's being
so nice to Ivy.

147
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,060
The first is to make me angry and I
dread to think about the second.

148
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,200
And I have my reason for getting
THAT to the dining room before
midnight.

149
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,980
I don't exactly know why but I feel
very happy that Matthew's been
allowed a last word.

150
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,140
I agree, more than I can say.

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I knew he'd have a sensible plan.

152
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm not sure how sensible it is.

153
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,160
If the letter is valid, the estate
will have to pay death duties twice
before it reaches little George.

154
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,120
But in the meantime it will have all
the benefit of Mary's interest.

155
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,060
I hope you intend to get stuck in.

156
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,100
I want the right to an opinion. I
shall be content with that.

157
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,080
You already have a right to an
opinion. Do I? Good.

158
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Most certainly you do. In fact,
there's a question of using empty
farmyards as new sources of revenue.

159
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,140
I'd like to know what you feel about
that.

160
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,100
Well, I'd have to think about it -

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,060
Crop rotation, livestock versus
cereals, or indeed the whole matter
of the tax.

162
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,220
There are lots of things I would
like your opinion on.

163
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,180
I assume you're trying to make some
sort of point?

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,060
He's trying to show that a woman's
place is in the home.

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,020
But she knows a lot about Matthew's
plans.

166
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,060
That has value for me.

167
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,060
Mrs Crawley, what do you think?

168
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,020
I'm afraid I'm on Mary's side,
Robert, if sides there must be.

169
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,220
There are no sides, not at all. I'm
pleased if you're pleased. I'm just
saying YOU have some work to do.

170
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
That is IF the letter turns out to
be valid.

171
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Which you very much hope it is not.

172
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,580
What's the matter with you?

173
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,460
I'm a stupid fool, that's what.
Oh, lordy.

174
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,520
How did you manage that?

175
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,520
Daydreaming. I don't know what I
was about. She'll be livid.

176
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Not if you do as I tell you. Come
on.

177
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,620
By the way did you get that card
For Gwen? Yes, why?

178
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,400
I thought it'd be nice for people in
the village to sign it.

179
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,540
The Bakewells, Mr Molesley, that
sort of thing.

180
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,640
I'll collect them. You surprise me.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,480
Why?

182
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,520
I never think of you as social.

183
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,420
Why should I be social,
when I have you?

184
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,420
You wrote to the Opera House in
Belfast?

185
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,440
That was enterprising.
I wrote to a great many theatres.

186
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,380
But the manager at the Opera House
wrote back.

187
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,560
It seems they're in need of a
stage door keeper.

188
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,640
They'd chosen one but he dropped
out. He asks Mr Grigg to consider
it.

189
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,480
I heard about Mr Matthew's letter.
I hope it wasn't too upsetting.

190
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
As a matter of fact, it was a
relief.

191
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,500
I felt so happy that he'd finally
been heard

192
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,480
but judging by tonight's dinner, it
may prove a heavy mantle for Lady
Mary.

193
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,520
I shall keep it on my dressing
table to remind me that Matthew is on
my side.

194
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,600
They're all on your side.

195
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,640
Papa gave me such a whacking at
dinner.

196
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,520
Your father loves you very much.

197
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,520
He's also very glad to have Downton
back under his control.

198
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,380
He always speaks highly of Mr
Matthew and the changes he made.

199
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,540
I'm sure he is very genuine but he
thinks he can manage alone now

200
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,460
and the question is, can he?

201
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,480
You wanted to borrow a belt, m'lady?

202
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,460
Lady Mary wondered if any of these
might suit?

203
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,640
Thank you.

204
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,440
Actually, I'm glad that you're here
as there's something I want to ask.

205
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,600
Look what I found in the village
today.

206
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,500
Don't you think it would be the most
terrific fun?

207
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,460
Have you asked her ladyship?

208
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,420
She'd never let me go, at least not
without a chaperone but Lady Edith
will be in London

209
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,540
and Lady Mary's not in the mood.

210
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,420
But is this quite suitable? It looks
more like something for servants and
farmworkers to me.

211
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,500
So? They'll dance the one-step,
won't they?

212
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,640
I've practiced and practiced and I'm
dying to try it.

213
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,480
Won't you accompany me?

214
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,640
Then if we're found out, I can say
that you came with me so nothing was
amiss.

215
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,440
Of course I can't, m'lady, not
without asking Lady Mary.

216
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,520
But that would spoil everything.
She'd be bound to tell Lady
Grantham.

217
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,640
Please? I know you love dancing

218
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,520
and Mr Bates may have many qualities
but he's not a dancer.

219
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,560
No, m'lady, he isn't a dancer...

220
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,560
but I'm afraid its quite impossible.

221
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,480
But how did it happen?
I don't like to say, m'lady.

222
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,580
I am truly vexed. It was a
favourite.

223
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,440
I know, m'lady, and I'm very sorry.

224
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,640
But you won't tell me how you did it.
I can't.

225
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,520
Very well, Braithwaite. I suppose
you'd better look me out another.

226
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,620
What are you doing? I'm just sorting
some old papers. I haven't looked at
these in years.

227
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Why are you looking now?
No particular reason.

228
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,480
Ah. I knew I hadn't thrown it away.

229
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,640
Who was she? Just a friend at one
time.

230
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
What was she called?

231
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,520
Alice. Alice Neal.

232
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,560
And you were fond of her? I was but
people drift in and out of your
life, don't they?

233
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,480
Truth to tell, I felt she'd treated
me badly.

234
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,500
What does it matter anyway?

235
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,420
We shout and scream and wail and cry
but in the end we must all die.

236
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Well, that's cheered me up (!)

237
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,620
Thank you. Now I'll get on with my
work.

238
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,480
Your ladyship, Mr Bates.

239
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,540
Bates?

240
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,540
I am very sorry to interrupt you
when you're busy, m'lady.

241
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,640
It concerns Mr Molesley the younger.

242
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,580
You make him sound like a Greek
philosopher.

243
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,400
He has fallen on hard times and I
know that YOU have helped him in the
past.

244
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,520
Are you asking me to give him some
money?

245
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I am asking for money, yes. Although
he's too proud to accept it as a
gift.

246
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,460
Oh, how refreshing.

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,440
Although I think we can find a way.

248
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Morning, Barrow.

249
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
Good morning, m'lady.

250
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,460
Is his lordship in the library?
He is but erm...

251
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,520
What is it?

252
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,580
Miss Braithwaite is very unhappy.
With good reason.

253
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,460
Yes, but you see...

254
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:01,500
she couldn't explain how it happened
because, well, she didn't want to
point the finger.

255
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,420
Point the finger at whom?

256
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,560
Well, that's just it, m'lady,
I dare not either.

257
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,460
I'm in enough trouble with Mr Bates
as it is.

258
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,460
You're not saying Bates is to blame?

259
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,420
Not Mr Bates himself, no.

260
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
Anna, then, but why would she do
such a thing?

261
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,420
As to that, m'lady, who knows?
Perhaps it was an accident.

262
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,460
Though they do say there's no-one so
jealous as a lady's maid.

263
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
Cora, is that you?

264
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Could I ask you something?

265
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,520
Where's my scent? Here you are,
m'lady.

266
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,460
Oh!
How stupid of me.

267
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,600
That was my clumsiness.
No, it was me.

268
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,480
Damn! Now the room's going to smell
like a tart's boudoir.

269
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll clean it up.

270
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,580
Is it all gone?
I'm afraid so.

271
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,460
It means a trip to Mr Roberts.
There's no-one nearer who sells it
here.

272
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,540
It's only York.
I could go, if you like.

273
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,600
In fact...

274
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,540
What?

275
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,460
Lady Rose asked me if I'd chaperone
her to a the dansant in York today.

276
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,460
She didn't want to ask her ladyship
but she thought she'd get away with
it if I went with her.

277
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,560
And what did you say? That I couldn't
go without your permission.

278
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,560
Well, it is rather slow here for a
girl her age.

279
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,600
Go but make sure you keep her out of
trouble.

280
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,520
Go on. I know Gwen'd appreciate it.

281
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,580
I don't see why. I didn't know her
that well.

282
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,560
But you can sign it, surely?

283
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,580
And why don't you come over tonight?
We haven't seen you in a while.

284
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,620
You're very friendly.
Aren't I usually friendly?

285
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,540
No. You're not discourteous,
Mr Bates, I'll give you that

286
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,600
but you're not friendly, except to
Anna, of course.

287
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,480
Well, I shall try to do better
in future.

288
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
See you tonight.

289
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,560
Mr Branson, Your ladyship.

290
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Sorry if I'm late. I had to call on
old Fairclough at Roundhills.

291
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,560
You're not at all late.

292
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,460
Now I asked Branson to come here
because I have an idea.

293
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,420
Granny, you must call him Tom.

294
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
I thought I could call him Branson
again now that he's the agent.

295
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,420
Well, you can't. I don't mind.

296
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,580
No. I see I'm beaten but, oh, how I
sympathise with King Canute.

297
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,420
Now what is this idea?

298
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Well, Mary, either YOU or your baby
son own half of Downton.

299
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,560
I want you to have a say in the
running of it.

300
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,500
It's just what you need.

301
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,540
But didn't last night's dinner
disabuse you of that scheme?

302
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,540
Well, that's the point. I want er...
Tom. TOM to be your instructor.

303
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:02,380
What? Well, take Mary, you know,
on your rounds.

304
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Let her learn the farmers'
difficulties.

305
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,540
Mmm.

306
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,420
Explain the crops and the live,
the livestock.

307
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,400
You know, let her see the problems
facing the estate.

308
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,420
And are we to do all this without
telling Papa?

309
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,500
Isn't that rather underhand?

310
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,560
There can be too much truth in any
relationship.

311
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,560
Mrs Crawley.

312
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,580
We weren't expecting you.

313
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,540
Her ladyship is lunching with Lady
Ingram, his lordship is walking,

314
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,600
Lady Mary's at the Dower House and
Lady Edith is in London.

315
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,400
As a matter of fact,
it's YOU I came to see.

316
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:54,440
To talk about Charles Grigg. You
know he's got a job at the Opera
House in Belfast.

317
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,560
He's so anxious to talk to you
before he goes.

318
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,400
Then he is in for a disappointment.

319
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,500
He says he is resolved to put his
dishonesty behind him.

320
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,400
Is he now?

321
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,540
I know it's more than that.

322
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,560
He told me he'd caused you great
unhappiness but he said it was not
his fault.

323
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
He was always a liar.

324
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
I see.

325
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,420
It seems a pity not to take the
chance to end a quarrel.

326
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
Isn't it better than to let things
fester?

327
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,400
I don't mean to speak out of turn,
Mrs Crawley,

328
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,580
but you will, I think, accept that
any difference between Mr Grigg and
me is my concern.

329
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Of course it is.

330
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I'm sorry.

331
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,520
Thank you, Carson.

332
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Good day.

333
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,620
Shall I make us some coffee?

334
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,600
You are so domesticated.

335
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,580
No, not really.

336
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,500
Monk just lays it all out. I only
have to pour in the water.

337
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,600
I mean it. Compared to Papa you're a
famous chef.

338
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Really. He can't boil a kettle.

339
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,540
If the servants left, he'd be found
in a passage, dead, arms stretched
out looking for the kitchen.

340
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,460
Well, I hope you can boil a kettle.

341
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,640
Life with me won't be quite what
you're used to.

342
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,580
How are things going? Ah, well, at
least my lawyer thinks so.

343
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,440
Are you sure about this?

344
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,560
The Royal Family convulses the
nation by ceasing to be German and
you want to take it up.

345
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,600
Does it matter that people will hate
you for it?

346
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,580
Will you hate me? I will love you
more than ever.

347
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,580
That's all right, then. I'm pretty
tough.

348
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,400
I may not be used to the splendours
of Downton but I do know how to look
after myself.

349
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,400
Would you like to see Downton?
Where did that come from?

350
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,540
Well, I was thinking if you are
nearly German and nearly divorced,

351
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,480
perhaps the family should know you a
bit.

352
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,420
It won't be settled tomorrow, my
darling, I can't pretend it will.

353
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,500
Don't put me off.

354
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,480
Aren't you curious about my
childhood home?

355
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,480
I'm curious about everything to do
with you.

356
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
BUT my situation would frighten them
and we don't want that.

357
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,480
I know. Mama's giving a house party
next month. Why don't you come?

358
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,500
Then you can blend in and look
around

359
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,380
without anyone asking too many
questions and Mama won't mind, she
likes you.

360
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
But your father doesn't.

361
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,560
He doesn't know you.
He'll like you when he does.

362
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,500
Now, I must gulp my coffee down and
run if I'm to catch the three
o'clock.

363
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
I can't persuade you to stay?

364
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,460
But, I will say this, it's getting
harder and harder to say no.

365
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Oh, look, we'll take that table.

366
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,620
I'm not sure we should be here,
m'lady. It seems unsuitable to me.

367
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,560
Don't call me m'lady, call me Rose.
I can't!

368
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Well, then don't call me anything.

369
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,600
Seen her down there?
Yes?

370
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,400
Well, it is a the dansant, let's have
a cup of tea. All right, tea.

371
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,460
Oh, but perhaps with something
special in mine? Right you are,
Miss.

372
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,640
Listen! It's the one-step!

373
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
Oh, why are they being so slow?

374
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,560
Really, m'lady. You mustn't be so
obvious. Why not? It's working.

375
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,380
I don't suppose you'd care to dance?

376
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
Then you'd be wrong because I'd
absolutely love to.

377
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,420
Shouldn't we be introduced?
The name's Sam Thawley. How do?

378
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,600
I'm Rose...Smith.

379
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,420
Hello. I hope you know how to do
this.

380
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,520
You're in luck. They call me Twinkle
Toes.

381
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,500
Hello, Anna. Jimmy, What are you
doing here?

382
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,420
I was just picking up some things for
Mrs Patmore. Shall we dance?

383
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,440
We'd better, if only to check Lady
Rose isn't getting in too deep.

384
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,500
I'm under gardener for Lord Ellis
near Easingwold. What about you?

385
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,480
I'm at... I'm at Downton Abbey.

386
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:36,420
Oh, yeah? What do you do? Are you a
lady's maid?

387
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,420
You sound posh enough.
Do I? I'm so pleased. I've...

388
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,620
I've worked and worked on my accent.

389
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,580
Ah, you've done well. You could pass
for a real lady never mind a lady's
maid.

390
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:53,460
I'm not a lady's maid yet. Anna is,
the girl I'm with, but I wonder if
I'm clever enough.

391
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,460
Ah, well, you won't be a housemaid
forever. I expect you've got a few
young farmers hanging about.

392
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,520
I couldn't say.
You won't say, you mean.

393
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,500
James? How how how did you find us?

394
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,500
I saw you across the square, m'lady.
Rose was saying what fun it is to be
out like this.

395
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,620
I thought I'd pop in to see what the
craic was.

396
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,400
It's a good craic, isn't it, Sam?

397
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Well, it is with you in my arms.

398
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,420
I love the view from up here.

399
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,420
If you know the view, all the
better.

400
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,500
Follow that hedge.

401
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,480
To the left of it is Oakwood Farm,
to the right is all farmed by us.

402
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,540
Do we want to take over Oakwood
Farm? No.

403
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,440
The Olds are good tenants and hard
workers.

404
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,640
Mm.

405
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,600
There is one subject we ought to
discuss.

406
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,560
I know your position isn't settled
but we should. Go on.

407
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,520
The death duties. If you are the
heir, it won't change them.

408
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
There's no special treatment for
widows. You do not surprise me.

409
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,460
It seems odd, really, that you have
to pay just as much tax

410
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,500
as if he'd left it all to Mrs
Tiggywinkle down the road.

411
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Mm. But that's how it works.

412
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
So, what are we to do?

413
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,500
Your father believes we should sell
land and pay it off in one lump.

414
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,560
But you don't?
I want to know what you think.

415
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,540
I've some good tickets for me and
Ivy.

416
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,580
To see Phyllis Dare? I don't believe
you.

417
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Well, I have. It cost a packet and
no mistake.

418
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,440
Does Ivy know? Not yet.

419
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,520
Mate, let's have a dance, eh?

420
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,620
Sorry, I'm dancing with her. I said
let her dance with me.

421
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,420
I don't want to dance with you.

422
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,420
How do you know if you've not even
tried it?

423
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,460
Don't tell me you're falling for her
at last? She will be pleased.

424
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,500
I said leave her alone.
That's the idea.

425
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Out the way! Come on, then.

426
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,640
Sam are you OK?
Get off me. Get off my hand!

427
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,540
Get off him! Sam! Get off! Get off!
Sam! Get her out of here!

428
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,460
Get off him! Come here, you.
James!

429
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,640
I can't leave when he's fighting to
protect me.

430
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,580
You can, or do you want to be
arrested?

431
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,420
We need to get out of here.

432
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,640
That settles it.
Come on! Go, go, go!

433
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,500
Mr Molesley, is that you? Come in
and have a cup of tea.

434
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,580
Mr Bates thought I might be welcome.
And so you are. Sit down.

435
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Mr Molesley, I'm glad you're here.

436
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,500
I was going through my desk this
afternoon

437
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,520
and I came upon that note of mine
and, er, if you're willing, I'd like
to pay it off now.

438
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,620
What note? Well, you lent me some
money when I was first came here

439
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,620
and I'm sorry I haven't paid it back
before now but the truth is I'm
afraid I forgot.

440
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,460
I don't remember anything about it.
£30! Aren't you the lucky one!

441
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,640
Surely there must be some mistake?

442
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,500
You'll not deny that's your
signature Plain as day.

443
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,380
How was your trip to York?
Never mind that, what's going on?

444
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,460
Mr Bates has remembered he owed £30
to Mr Molesley. What?

445
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,600
But, but, but, no er...
There you are and thank you for
coming to my aid when I needed it.

446
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,560
Now, I must go. I have some things
to do before his lordship comes up.

447
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,560
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

448
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,460
Mr Carson, can I have a word?
Certainly, James.

449
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
Why did you do that?

450
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,600
You have put up with so much that I
couldn't change

451
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:11,600
so if there is ever the slightest
thing I can make better for you,
then I will.

452
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,440
But how did you manage it?
Don't I keep telling you? Prison was
an education.

453
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Take her to the theatre?
It is my half day.

454
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,620
But not hers and how do we know
she'd want to go. She'll want to go.

455
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,580
She could change her half day.
Oh, I don't know.

456
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,520
It's turning into Liberty Hall round
here.

457
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,400
Are we entertaining that night?

458
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm not cooking. They'll all be
dining with Lady Lawson at Brough
Hall.

459
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,420
Very well but no lingering.

460
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,560
You can go and give her the good
news. Thank you, Mr Carson.

461
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,620
I hope he doesn't break her heart.

462
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,380
We must all have our hearts broken
once or twice before we're done.

463
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,440
True enough, Mrs Hughes.

464
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:12,640
Strange to think the theatre was
part of my life at one time.

465
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Yours and Mr Griggs.

466
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,560
You know he's going to work in
Belfast?

467
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:25,640
I had heard. He's leaving the
village in the morning.

468
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,420
The 11 o'clock train.
What's that to me?

469
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,420
I'll tell you what it is. It's an
open wound.

470
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,500
I don't know why but I do know this:

471
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,600
You'd do better to stitch it up
and let it heal.

472
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,420
I'm sorry, m'lord, I didn't hear the
gong. It's all right. It hasn't gone
yet.

473
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,460
I was hoping to catch you.

474
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,600
Of course I understand how tiresome
it must have been for Anna

475
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,560
when Edna came back and was suddenly
the senior lady's maid.

476
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
M'lord? Ask her to go easy.

477
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,460
I'm sorry, m'lord, but I don't
understand what you're saying.

478
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,580
Her ladyship appears to think
there's been some bad feeling
between Braithwaite and Anna.

479
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,460
That Anna has been a little unkind.
Not that I know of.

480
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,600
Look, I don't want to make a thing
of it. I'm just asking for a little
consideration, that's all.

481
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,380
And you shall have it, m'lord.
Good. That's all I needed to hear.

482
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Ah, there's the gong now.

483
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,500
I just can't believe you're letting
me go. Do you really mean it?

484
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,520
No, I was having you on.

485
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,560
Oh, don't be so soft. I've said you
can go and you can go.

486
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,620
What should I wear? Clothes.

487
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,440
But I haven't got anything right.
Not for the theatre in York.
It's not Covent Garden.

488
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,540
What? Oh, never mind. We'll make you
look presentable.

489
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,600
Now get that parsley!

490
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,520
I don't know why she's so excited.
It's only a bloomin' play.

491
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,640
He's just as keen on her as ever.
We'll see. Nothing's as changeable
as a young man's heart.

492
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Take hope and a warning from that.

493
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I'll get it.

494
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,500
Yes? I was wondering if I could have
a word with the housemaid Rose.

495
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,420
The housemaid Rose? The maid Rose
who works here.

496
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
Look, chum. I'll deal with it, Mr
Barrow.

497
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,480
Hello, Mr Thawley.

498
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,500
Well, I'll leave you to it.

499
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,460
I've got to know she's all right.

500
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,460
Rose is a bit busy just now but I'll
tell her you asked.

501
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,400
I don't mind waiting.

502
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,420
Can I er... Can I come in?

503
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,560
If you'll just stay there, I'll...
I'll see what she's up to.

504
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,420
Anna? What? What is it?

505
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,600
The man you were dancing with, Sam
Thawley, he's downstairs.

506
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,540
But why? What what does he want?

507
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,460
He says he's come to make sure that
you're all right.

508
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,460
What have you done with him? Left
him in the yard before he asks the
others any questions.

509
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,400
But what can I say? What can I do?

510
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Come with me. I've got an idea.

511
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,380
This is so very kind of you.
I had to come.

512
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,540
You know, I had to see that you were
...er, you know, all right after
that ruckus.

513
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,440
And I...and I am, thanks to you.

514
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,460
I never saw anything so brave as the
way you punched that horrid man.

515
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I'd do more than that for you.

516
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
How very flattering.

517
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Where did you grow up? You don't
sound very Yorkshire.

518
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,640
Don't I? That's...

519
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,620
that's because my life's been sort of
spent all over the place.

520
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,640
North, south, east, west...

521
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,480
Home's the place that I love best.

522
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,580
What?
That's how the song goes.

523
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,520
Yes, I...I suppose it is.

524
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Would you let me call on you again?

525
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Well... Look, I know I'm not good
enough for you, I can see that

526
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,440
but I'm a steady chap, ask Lord
Ellis's agent.

527
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,440
He'd give me a good reference. I'm
sure but it's...it's something else.

528
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,520
Do you remember wondering if any of
the local farmers were after me?

529
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,500
Yeah. Well, that's the thing, I...

530
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,620
There is one farmer and I didn't want
to spoil this afternoon by mentioning
it

531
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,400
but I have rather given him my word.

532
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,480
Well, that's me back in my box,
then. I hope you understand.

533
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,480
Course I do. He's a lucky bloke,
that's all I'll say.

534
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,600
Well, good luck, then.
It's been nice knowing you.

535
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,420
You too.

536
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,580
Mr Thawley? Sam?

537
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,560
When you do find someone, someone
much nicer and better than I am...

538
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
..she'll be a very lucky girl.

539
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,520
What the - Say nothing and I'll be
your friend forever.

540
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,400
Is Lord Grantham in the drawing
room? Yes, m'lady. Thank you.

541
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Ah, here she is.

542
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,580
Oh, darling. Ah, are you only just
back?

543
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,480
We sat forever outside Peterborough.
We never found out why.

544
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,600
Shall I change?
No, don't bother. It's only us.

545
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:13,480
And who are we to warrant any
courtesy? Don't be difficult, Granny.

546
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Where's Rose? Have we lost her?

547
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,500
I'm so sorry I'm late.
Never mind, never mind.

548
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,460
Now I've got you all here, and
before Carson comes in, I have
something to say.

549
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,600
I had a letter today from Murray.

550
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,520
Wait just a moment while I finish.

551
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,400
Shall I leave, my lord?
No. You might as well hear this.

552
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,580
Murray has taken Matthew's letter to
various authorities

553
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,540
and their conclusion is that it
demonstrates testamentary intention.
What's that?

554
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,540
It means that the writer intended
the document to serve as a will.

555
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,640
So, the bequest stands? Yes. Mary
owns half the estate.

556
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,560
That sounds like a very good result.
And now we should go into dinner
before Mrs Patmore blows a gasket.

557
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,500
Dearest Papa, I hope you're not too
disappointed.

558
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,460
Don't be silly. Not at all.

559
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,540
Perhaps the three of us can sit down
tomorrow and talk properly.

560
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,460
Of course but the main problem is a
simple one: tax.

561
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,600
But that's it, Tom's told me you
want to sell land to pay for it.

562
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,400
It's the only way, I'm afraid.
Yes, but, you see, I don't agree.

563
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,600
Anyway, let's not talk about it now.
We ought to join the others.

564
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,460
If you've put her up to this...

565
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,640
I haven't put her up to anything but
you won't keep her quiet, not now
the bit's between her teeth.

566
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Don't think that you will.

567
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,440
I don't know what he meant.
You must have said something.

568
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,400
But I haven't said anything.

569
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,560
I warned her off Mr Barrow, that's
all, but I wasn't having a go at her.

570
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,500
All I can tell you is that she has
managed to take offence.

571
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,520
She can't have.

572
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,540
Mr Barrow, what are you doing down
here?

573
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,540
Will you come up this moment and
help me serve the wine?

574
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,460
Sorry, Mr Carson, I'm on my way.

575
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,620
What's so funny?

576
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Nothing, Mr Bates.

577
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Nothing at all.

578
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Good morning, Carson.

579
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,640
I hope I'm not in the way.
Not a bit. You remember Mr Grigg?

580
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,560
Hello, Charlie. Good of you to come.

581
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,520
I'm delighted but I'm not surprised.

582
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,540
Aren't you? Because I'm astonished.

583
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,580
But why did you never speak of Alice
when we last met before the war?

584
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,500
What was the point? She chose you
all those years ago and that was it.

585
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,560
Why bring it up?
Because it wasn't IT.

586
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,500
She chose me but it never worked.

587
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,580
She's dead now, anyway,
but it was never IT.

588
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,580
I didn't know she was dead.
Five year ago.

589
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,600
We'd separated long before but I
went to see her in St Thomas's.

590
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,420
Do you know what she said?

591
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,420
She said, 'Charlie Carson was the
better man. I could have loved him.

592
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,620
I did love him, really, but I was a
fool and couldn't see it.'

593
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,460
Did she say that? Honestly?

594
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,460
That she loved you? Aye, she did

595
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,540
and she wanted me to tell you,
if I saw you again.

596
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,620
There we are. We could have made a
go of it, you know.

597
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,620
As long as you know that it were her
choice. I never set out to take her
off you.

598
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,420
All aboard!

599
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,520
I am sorry to interrupt but I think
you must get aboard.

600
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,540
I can't tell you how grateful I am,
Mrs Crawley. Very good luck.

601
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Thank you.

602
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,520
I doubt we'll meet again
but can we shake on it?

603
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,560
We've known some ups and downs
together, it's true,

604
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,560
but if this is goodbye...

605
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,540
let's part as friends, eh?

606
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
All right.

607
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,620
I wish you well. Likewise...

608
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,640
..Charlie.

609
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,420
Mrs Crawley, I should be grateful

610
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,580
if you would let me know any expense
you have been put to on Mr Griggs'
behalf during his stay with you.

611
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Oh, no. That's completely
unnecessary. I should be grateful.

612
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,500
Very well, Carson, I shall do that.

613
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,420
Good day to you.

614
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,540
Mr Carson?

615
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,560
Shall we walk back together?

616
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,420
I gather the Abbey is once more to
be a scene of great splendour.

617
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,400
- Who's the glamorous pirate?
- Johnnie Gillingham's son.

618
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,600
Stick it under my arm, if you can.
You're an angel from above.

619
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,400
- I don't know about that.
- Is there anyone who wants to dance?

620
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,420
- What about it?
- How can grown men throw away
their fortune like that?
What could be more stupid?

621
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,640
- There's something about him
that gets my goat.
- He was just trying to
be nice.

622
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,420
I don't want them to spend
their days in gloom.
- It seems disloyal to Matthew.

623
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,420
Screaming in the servants' halls.
What a topsy-turvy world
we've come to.

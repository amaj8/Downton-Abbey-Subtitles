1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,500
His lordship is going to America.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,340
What are you talking about?
A telegram has just arrived.

3
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,460
He's leaving today. Something's
happened to her ladyship's brother.

4
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,500
So, you mean you have to go, too?

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,400
I can't leave Anna, Mrs Hughes.
Not now.

6
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,460
How can she put me in this position?
It's not fair!

7
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,420
I agree.
But, why does your mother need me?

8
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,360
"Robert must be there." Why?

9
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,340
My being there won't
make a difference.

10
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,500
They obviously feel it will.

11
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,300
Maybe they don't want the Committee
to think Harold's a wildcat driller.

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,460
An earl as a brother-in-law
will make him respectable?

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,420
They seem to believe so.

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,400
I know plenty of relatives of
English earls who belong in gaol!

15
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,300
I suppose we've made the decision.

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,380
- I can't stop his lordship from going.
- Of course not.

17
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,540
But, I wonder if it's necessary
for Mr Bates to go with him.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,540
It'll be very hard for Anna
to lose his support at this time.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,500
Mrs Hughes,
I hope we are good employers,

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,500
but even we expect
to get what we pay for.

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,380
Bates is in this house
as his lordship's valet.

22
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,320
I know that, m'lady,
but this is a special circumstance.

23
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,320
Why, particularly?

24
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
It's not my secret to tell.

25
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,360
If you wish to enlist my help,
I must know the facts.

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,520
I won't go.

27
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,420
I see, so you'll leave
his lordship in the lurch,

28
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,360
and probably lose your job,
and all this to help me?

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Go home and pack.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,300
You are asking me
to travel without a valet?

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
I'm asking you not to take Bates.

32
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,420
You do know the Americans
have a correct uniform

33
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,460
for practically every
activity known to man?

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,380
Thomas was your valet the whole time
Bates was in prison.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,380
He knows how you like things done.
Suppose he doesn't want to go?

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,380
Why wouldn't he? It's an adventure.

37
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,340
All those handsome stewards
strutting down the boat deck.

38
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,500
Don't be vulgar.
What do you know of such matters?

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,460
I've been married.
I know everything.

40
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,300
But if you could just explain
why Bates can't come?

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
I can't explain it.

42
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,340
If I could, you would agree with me.

43
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,460
I found this for the shoes, m'lord.

44
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm afraid it seems you won't
be coming with me, Bates.

45
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,380
Thomas has been selected
as your deputy.

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,420
What?

47
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Lady Mary persuaded me
you are more needed here,

48
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,480
though why I couldn't tell you.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,420
I'd better get on.

50
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,360
Your grandmother will arrive shortly.

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,440
What have they told you?

52
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
That Anna was...

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,340
..'attacked' by some ruffian
who'd broken in.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,420
While I sat upstairs,
enjoying the music.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,440
It's not your fault, Bates.

56
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,360
It wasn't hers, but it wasn't yours.

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,420
Thank you.

58
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,300
I thought I'd come
to wish Lord Grantham

59
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,300
good luck on his journey.

60
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,380
He's upstairs getting ready, m'lady.
Everyone else is in the library.

61
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,340
Oh, Rose, my dear...

62
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,380
I wonder, I wonder if I might
please have a glass of water?

63
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,380
Thank you.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,340
Judging how things are
going, he can manage very well.

65
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,420
Oh? Are we disturbing the conclave?

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,360
We're just discussing the pigs.

67
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,300
Ah, the arrival of the pigs
and the departure of their master.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,340
It's sad Lord Grantham
has to miss it.

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,300
Are the pigs a good idea, Mr Blake?

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,340
It's a good idea for estates
to maximise and diversify.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,340
The question is whether or not
Lord Grantham and Lady Mary

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,380
fully appreciate what
they're taking on.

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,460
Oh? You ask as if the answer were no.

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,540
Mr Blake is not under Mary's spell.

75
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,460
Oh?

76
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,500
Mrs Crawley.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Morning.
Good morning.

78
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,440
Your water, m'lady.
Thank you, Carson.

79
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,300
Are you feeling hot? I am.

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,460
I've just walked up
from the village.

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,520
I am a bit hot, but I didn't walk.

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,300
I envy you.

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,460
Well, I'm not sorry. I can say that.

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,340
How do you know you'll get a ship?
There's always empty cabins.

85
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,500
Sure we'll find something.
Oh, I wish it were me.

86
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Wouldn't you miss Ivy?

87
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,520
Nothing's gonna come of that.
It were a waste of money and effort.

88
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,340
I'm sure something's
around the corner.

89
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,520
I wish it'd get a move on
or I might do something stupid.

90
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,460
Ha! Well, when I get back,
I want to find you happy and healthy

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,500
and courting a girl
from the village.

92
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,340
Come on, let's go up.
You can wish me luck.

93
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,460
Darling, I do think your going to
rescue my hopeless brother

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,420
is an act of real love,
and I cherish you for it.

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,300
That'll keep me warm
as I cross the raging seas.

96
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,480
Good. Now, kiss me.

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Lady Grantham says we can stay
'til we're done.

98
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,360
But, it'll be a few weeks more.
I hope you don't mind.

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,440
Not if you make yourselves useful.
We will.

100
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,320
Try to be strong, my darling.
I will.

101
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,520
Gregson must be out there somewhere.

102
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,340
I wish you'd let me send a detective.
There's no point.

103
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,480
His firm's already done all that
to no avail.

104
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,420
If there's anything
you want us to do,

105
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,460
Mama will give you whatever you need.

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,300
Goodbye, Mama.
Goodbye, my dear.

107
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,300
Try not to let those Yankees
drive you mad.

108
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,340
Mary? Why so preoccupied?

109
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,400
Am I? I'm afraid my mind
is on other things.

110
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,340
Anyway, goodbye, Papa,
and please try to enjoy yourself.

111
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,340
Good luck with the pigs.

112
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,500
Rose, I leave you in charge of fun.

113
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,420
Mission understood, Captain.

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,380
Goodbye, Isobel.

115
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,460
Bye, Tom.

116
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,300
Look after all my womenfolk,
including Isis.

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,460
Especially Isis.
I'll try my best.

118
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,480
Goodbye, Miss Baxter. I look forward
to a full report when I get back.

119
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,520
Why am I going instead of Mr Bates?

120
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,300
I don't know.

121
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,440
No, but that's what
you're going to find out.

122
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,340
Oh... Well, that's a relief.

123
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,420
Is it?

124
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
Yes, I'm... I'm feeling rather ill.

125
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,340
I wanted him away before I keel over.

126
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,340
I am sorry. Would you like me
to come back with you?

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,340
That is the very last thing
I would want.

128
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,400
Oh, Carson, can I have a car please,
to take me home?

129
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,320
Certainly, your ladyship...
Yes, now.

130
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,520
Thank you for seeing him off.
Evelyn wanted to.

131
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,320
But, now we must go
or we'll be late.

132
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,360
Is it just lack of money,
why these places are all failing?

133
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,440
Usually. But, why is that?

134
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,440
Because so few owners make the most
of what an estate has to offer.

135
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,500
So few think about income.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,400
So few are ready to
adjust their way of life.

137
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,300
You have to understand
what these people are used to.

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
No. They have to get used to
something different.

139
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,360
They think nothing needs to change.

140
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,500
That God will be upset
if the old order is overturned.

141
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,400
And you don't think He will be?
No.

142
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,540
To farm an estate is hard work,
and never more than now.

143
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,500
The owners must face up to that,

144
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,340
or they don't deserve
to keep what they have.

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,420
You look very intense.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,480
Mr Blake was saying he finds
people like you and me infuriating.

147
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,480
I should point out...
We must get going or we'll be late.

148
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,460
It's nice of you to drive me home.
I'm meeting the new pig man.

149
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,380
I do worry about your life away
from the estate. Is there any?

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,320
Huh, I've no time.

151
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,500
What happened
to your politics?

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,500
They vanished. Along with that
silly chauffeur chap named Branson.

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,340
I don't believe that.

154
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,500
I gather the MP, John Ward,

155
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,420
is coming to speak in Ripon tomorrow
at the Town Hall.

156
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,420
I could get tickets.

157
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,380
I don't think so.

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,500
I'm not a fan of the Coalition,
as it is.

159
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,520
He's only here because Lloyd George
thinks an election's coming.

160
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,340
Well, I doubt he has long, poor dear.

161
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,460
But, I don't think
you're being fair to Mr Ward.

162
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,460
Let's go. What do you say?

163
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,520
I'd say you better be nice to me,

164
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,440
or I'll tell old Lady Grantham you
called Lloyd George "poor dear."

165
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,300
Would you mind
if I went up to London tomorrow?

166
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,500
Is there news of Mr Gregson?

167
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,540
Well, they've pieced together
a little more.

168
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,460
He arrived in Munich
and signed into his hotel.

169
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,460
Then, that evening,
he went out and never came back.

170
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,400
But, it doesn't make any sense.
What was his reason for being there?

171
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,460
To see the castles of King Ludwig.

172
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,460
But darling, surely if he was
attacked or set upon,

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,440
they would have found him long ago?

174
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Oh, my dearest one, come here.

175
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,340
I don't ask you not to worry,
only not quite to give up hope.

176
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,340
Of course you must go up to London.
It would do you good.

177
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,400
Mama, can I ask you something?

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,300
You don't think I'm bad, do you?

179
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,500
You can be a bit sharp-tongued
every now and then!

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,440
But, bad? No.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,300
Sometimes I have bad feelings.

182
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,460
We all have bad feelings.

183
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,480
It's ACTING on them
that makes you bad.

184
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,380
I've had a letter from Alfred.

185
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,500
What's he got to say for himself?
He's doing well.

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Some French chap with a name
I can't pronounce,

187
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
seems to have taken a shine to him.

188
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,460
I don't think we need praise
from the French quite yet.

189
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,380
Does he mention us?

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,340
Er, his father's ill
so he's coming up to visit.

191
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,300
He hopes to look in on his way home
to see us all.

192
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,500
Really?
Why should you care?

193
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,400
She thinks it'd be nice to see him,
Daisy, and so it would be.

194
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,340
Rose? What is it?

195
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,360
I saw Edith on the stairs. She says
she's going to London tomorrow.

196
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,460
So, I wondered if I could go, too.

197
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,300
Rose, in a few months you'll have
been presented, you'll be out.

198
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,420
Everything will be possible.

199
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,460
You said most girls of my age
would already be presented.

200
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,300
Why do you want to go?

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,460
Just to see some old friends
you'd approve of madly.

202
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,500
Edith's so worried about Mr Gregson.
Maybe I could cheer her up.

203
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,460
Cousin Robert did leave me
in charge of fun!

204
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,380
Why is he always so superior?

205
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,420
He's frustrated by all the families
who are giving in.

206
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,460
The axe falls
and they do nothing to fight back.

207
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,500
But if they can't afford to go on?

208
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,340
They could if they'd take a new
approach to their inheritance,

209
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,300
instead of watching it being
carted away in boxes to be sold.

210
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,420
He can't think we're doing that.
Well, no.

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,300
But, he doubts you'd fight
if it came to it.

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,340
Hmm.

213
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,380
He says you're aloof.
Aloof?

214
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Well, I hope you've stuck up for me.
Of course I did, but, well...

215
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,400
Go on.

216
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,540
Charles thinks I'm blind
where you're concerned.

217
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,340
We should go in.

218
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,500
Has anyone told Mr Carson
that tea's ready?

219
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,480
There was a telegram earlier.
He took it up to her ladyship.

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,460
That means they've got the boat.

221
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
What a bonus for Mr Barrow.
A trip to America out of the blue.

222
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,500
Huh! I wouldn't fancy it,
all steaks and ketchup

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,480
and 'hail fellow, well met'.

224
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,540
What do you know about it?
I go to the pictures too, you know!

225
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,380
His lordship has secured passage
on the Cameronia.

226
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,540
They sail tomorrow and they'll
be in New York on Monday.

227
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,340
It's hard to credit, isn't it?

228
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,420
I've robbed you of such a chance.

229
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,420
You've robbed me of nothing
I wouldn't gladly give.

230
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,400
What did Mr Barrow mean about
expecting a report?

231
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,400
Something and nothing.

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,360
Are you still awake?

233
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,300
I was on my way to bed and something
told me to put on my coat

234
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,460
and walk over and check on you.

235
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,420
I hope you don't...

236
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,500
How long have you been like this?

237
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,420
I really don't feel well at all.

238
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,340
Right. I'm going now to fetch
Doctor Clarkson...

239
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,380
No, it's too late. It's too late!

240
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,360
I'll be back as soon as I can.
No fuss. Please.

241
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,360
Try and drink. I'll send your maid up
with some tea and some more water.

242
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,340
How was dinner?

243
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Uphill. I'm so bored with
Mr Blake's cold shoulder.

244
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,320
He hasn't warmed up, then?

245
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,400
According to Mr Napier,
he finds me aloof.

246
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,440
I'm not aloof, am I?

247
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,340
Do you want me to answer truthfully
or like a lady's maid?

248
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,380
Let's move on.

249
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,380
I heard you persuaded his lordship
to let Mr Bates stay here

250
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,480
and I'm so very grateful.

251
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,320
Then, you know Mrs Hughes
asked me to intervene...

252
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,500
..and told me why.

253
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,340
Yes. So she said.

254
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,500
We still can't find out who he was?

255
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,440
No.

256
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,480
He was a stranger, a...

257
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't know, a robber, but after...

258
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,300
Afterwards, he just ran off.

259
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
But, if you described him?

260
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,460
And ought you to see
Doctor Clarkson,

261
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
just to make sure?

262
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,480
M'lady, I...

263
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,480
I don't mind your knowing.

264
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,400
In fact, I'm glad in a way that
there's honesty between us again but,

265
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,460
but I can't talk about it.

266
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,340
Even to me? Because I want to help.

267
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,380
You've helped me,
God knows, in the past,

268
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
and now I want to help you.

269
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
I can't talk about it, m'lady.

270
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,440
Not even to you.

271
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,360
That's it. I should be in bed.

272
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,400
Before you go, I'm worried about
Alfred coming back quite so soon.

273
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,520
I thought you liked the lad?
Oh, I do. Very much.

274
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,380
But, we've had such trouble
with Ivy and Daisy.

275
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,320
We don't want it stirred up again.

276
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Can we put him off, just this once?

277
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,420
I don't think I've got his
parents' address, if I ever had it.

278
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,460
It's a shame.

279
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,440
- We're to end by mithering again.
- Oh!

280
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,340
She was a bit ill this morning,
but I thought it was just influenza.

281
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,340
This was never 'flu.
It looks like bronchitis.

282
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,320
But there is a lot of 'flu about and
my nurses are run off their feet.

283
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,480
I won't be able to spare...
I can do whatever needs to be done.

284
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,440
She'll need proper supervision,

285
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,400
otherwise there's a real danger it
could turn into pneumonia.

286
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,300
We'll have to hire someone...
No. I can manage.

287
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,500
There'll be no let up.
I know. What's the treatment?

288
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,440
Inhalants, really.
I'll bring some in the morning.

289
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,520
The main thing is to keep
her temperature down

290
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,300
and to stop pneumonia taking hold.

291
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,500
Morning, Ivy.

292
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,520
Oh, come on! I only asked
what a million men would ask.

293
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,420
And I only answered what
a million women would answer.

294
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,380
He's coming this tea time!

295
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,460
I'll meet him off the train,
give him a drink

296
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,500
and send him on his way.

297
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,420
It'll be too late to send him on
his way if he gets here after five!

298
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,500
Then I'll have to bite the bullet
and put him up at the pub.

299
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Won't he find that peculiar?

300
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,420
I don't think so.
I'll tell him we're all very busy.

301
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,420
Say there's 'flu in the house and
he mustn't miss out on his course.

302
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,460
You're quite a plotter
when you want to be, aren't you?

303
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,360
It's a skill all women must learn.

304
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,460
But are you certain?

305
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,440
- There must be something we can do.
- There isn't.

306
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,420
I can manage easily with help
from the servants.

307
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,380
We just have to stop it
turning into pneumonia.

308
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,540
That's the real danger.

309
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,340
It seems rather unfair
to saddle you with it all.

310
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,340
Why should you do it and not us?
Because I'm a trained nurse.

311
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,440
Why is the food so disgusting,
suddenly?

312
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,540
She doesn't know what she's saying.
I wouldn't be too sure.

313
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,500
Everything she puts into my mouth
is absolutely disgusting.

314
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,460
Perhaps we'd better
get out of your way.

315
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,300
That's all I ask.
I'll ring up if there's any change.

316
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,380
- I'm disappointed, Mr Carson.
- You don't want the 'flu.

317
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,420
You can't risk missing any more of
the course when you started late.

318
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,300
That's true...
I've booked you a room at the pub.

319
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,380
And it's on the house.
You didn't need to do that.

320
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,420
I think I did.
You've missed the last train.

321
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,420
You're very kind, Mr Carson.

322
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,480
We'll have a drink first.
You and me, man to man.

323
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,360
And then, I'll leave you to it.

324
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,500
Why did Alfred change his plans?
Mrs Hughes won't know, will she?

325
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,380
That's rather disappointing.

326
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,320
What have you got to be
disappointed about?

327
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,380
It'd be nice to see him.
I don't know why.

328
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,420
Why not?
I'll tell you.

329
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,420
Because you made his life a misery
with your unkindness

330
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,420
and your cold and vicious heart.

331
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,380
Steady on, Daisy. I don't think
Ivy's quite deserved this.

332
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,420
Well, we know one thing...
You were right to put him off!

333
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,380
Tonight there can be no let up.

334
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,540
You mustn't sleep, you must not let
her temperature get higher.

335
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,400
I want another nurse! I insist!
This, this one talks too much!

336
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,320
She's like a drunken vicar!

337
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
The family took me in
and kept me close

338
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,400
when my link with them had gone.

339
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,460
I owe them a great deal.
If you insist.

340
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll look in later.
Ring at the slightest change.

341
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,320
Well, the pigs have arrived.

342
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,380
Oh, I'd have come, if I'd known.

343
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,420
They said you'd gone
to your grandmother's.

344
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,500
It all went off smoothly.
We can see them tomorrow.

345
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,500
Did you get the message about
the tickets for the talk in Ripon?

346
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,360
I did. Why can't she come?

347
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,400
Because Mama's ill
and Isobel is nursing her.

348
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,500
What's the thing in Ripon?
A Liberal MP is speaking.

349
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,320
I don't think I'll bother.

350
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,460
Just because we're not political,
you mustn't be put off.

351
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
You won't come with me, then?
I'd rather go to the stake.

352
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,380
But what sort of errands?
Oh, you know. This and that.

353
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,340
Seeing friends, buying clothes,
errands.

354
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,440
I hope Sir John Bullock isn't one
of your "errands". He is not!

355
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,300
Oh, let her go, Aunt Rosamund.

356
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,380
All right, but you'll be back
in time for dinner.

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm sure I will. You're a darling.

358
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,320
Taxi!

359
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,340
"I'm sure I will."
What does that mean?

360
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
I don't know
why Mama let her come.

361
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,380
Darling, please tell me
what's the matter.

362
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,360
You seem so preoccupee lately.

363
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,340
What do you mean you'll be 'out'
tomorrow night?

364
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,500
I'll be away,
but I don't want Mama to know.

365
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,380
It's not very difficult.
It is difficult for me.

366
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,460
To be put in a position of falsehood
where your parents are concerned.

367
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,440
You said yourself I'm a grown woman
and you're not a spy.

368
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,320
The last time you did this you were
with your Mr Gregson, weren't you?

369
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,460
So it can't be a repetition.

370
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
Oh, my dear.

371
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,540
My dear...

372
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,420
I'm so pleased to see you.

373
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,500
I keep thinking
you'll forget about me.

374
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,500
Rose!

375
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,460
I won't forget you. Ever.

376
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,380
But...
But, what?

377
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,480
Rose, I like you very much...
But?

378
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,460
What can we hope
to come out of this?

379
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,360
Can't we just
be in the moment?

380
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,420
I don't know many men like you and
you don't know many girls like me.

381
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,460
Ain't that the truth?
Then let's enjoy it!

382
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,300
You know what the French say?

383
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,320
Vive le difference!

384
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,300
Do you think Lord Grantham
will enjoy the 'difference'?

385
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,300
Or Lady Mary?

386
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,300
You're not scared of them, are you?

387
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,520
No.
Good.

388
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,360
Then you'll take me
to the club tonight.

389
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,520
But first... Kiss me.

390
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,380
Or don't you want to?

391
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,520
Oh, I want to.
Don't you worry about that.

392
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,460
I'm not even sure which
frightens me most...

393
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,420
What may have happened
to Michael or...the baby.

394
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,320
Erm...

395
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,440
What do you propose to do?

396
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,520
It's...

397
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,460
..hard to say the words but...

398
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,500
I've decided to get rid of it.

399
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,300
How terrible it is to hear that.

400
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,440
Please don't pretend
you won't be relieved when I do.

401
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,380
You're not being fair.

402
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,500
I will support you
whatever you decide,

403
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,360
just as Cora will and Robert.

404
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,360
That sounds like a speech from
The Second Mrs Tanqueray.

405
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
But, you don't mean a word of it.

406
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,500
I do.

407
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,500
So, I'd be welcome in your
drawing room, would I?

408
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,460
"Have you met my niece
and her charming bastard?"

409
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
I refuse to be shocked!

410
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,500
But, what will you say when
Mr Gregson walks through the door,

411
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,360
with a full explanation
for his silence?

412
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,300
Nothing.

413
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,500
I pray he is alive,

414
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,340
but, if he is, I won't say a thing.

415
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,540
And you will marry him?

416
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,320
If he still wants me to.

417
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,300
So, your whole life
will be based on a lie?

418
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,360
Have you thought about that?

419
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,340
I am killing the wanted child
of a man I'm in love with

420
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,400
and you ask me if
I've thought about it?

421
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,340
I assume you'll be
away for the night

422
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,380
because you have booked into some...

423
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,360
..some place where
they will do this?

424
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
How did you find it?

425
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,340
There was a magazine in the ladies'
waiting room at King's Cross.

426
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,500
You do realise it is quite illegal?
Of course.

427
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,400
And dangerous!

428
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,340
What will I say to your parents
if it goes wrong?

429
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,400
You'll think of something.

430
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,500
Very well.

431
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,320
If you've made up your mind...

432
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,400
..I shall come with you.

433
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,360
Where's Evelyn?
Dining with friends of his parents.

434
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,540
He telephoned earlier, and Tom's
gone off to a political meeting,

435
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
so I'm afraid it's just us.

436
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,540
Don't be afraid.
But, we are afraid!

437
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,500
How can brainless dullards like us
ever hope to entertain Mr Blake?

438
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,420
Mary?! That sounded a little rude.

439
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,300
I can take it. Did the pigs arrive?

440
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,460
Absolutely.
Although un-witnessed by me.

441
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,420
I'll go with Tom tomorrow.

442
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,380
Well, I'm curious to see them
and I'll be out all day.

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,340
Why don't we walk down after dinner?
Lady Grantham?

444
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,460
You two go. I'll take it on trust.

445
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,380
Well, it's a nice evening.
What about it?

446
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,300
Well, it's quite a long walk,

447
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,460
but I don't mind,
if you really want to.

448
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,520
Is this seat taken?
I was keeping it for a friend.

449
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,300
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
I'm John Ward.

450
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
In a while I'll ask for questions

451
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,500
so please remember
what made you indignant

452
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,500
when you last read a newspaper.

453
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,420
Are you trying to attract my
attention ahead of the rest, madam?

454
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,480
I just wanted him
to take this chair.

455
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,520
Do you know this gentleman?
No.

456
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,460
You just wanted to sit next to him?

457
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,440
Er no, it was because he asked.

458
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,440
He asked to sit next to you?

459
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,420
Ladies and gentlemen, we've been
made privy to a very romantic story.

460
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,500
Why don't I sit down?

461
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,500
Of course, the question uppermost
in all of your minds is,

462
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,480
why the split between Mr Asquith
and Mr Lloyd George?

463
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,460
Because a divided party
spells electoral defeat.

464
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,520
Well, can I say this?

465
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,460
It doesn't have to.

466
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,540
He's wrong there.

467
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,360
Since 1910...

468
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,360
But you support them?
Not really.

469
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,400
I'm a Socialist. Or I was.

470
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,340
And in 1915...

471
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,420
What happened to your friend?
I don't know.

472
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,420
It just seemed silly
to keep the chair empty.

473
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,360
I'm glad.

474
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,500
Sssh!

475
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,380
Of course,
history teaches us that in 1910...

476
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,500
The idea is to learn from these,
then, if it's going well, expand.

477
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,500
And you have a good pig man?
He comes highly recommended.

478
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,540
Well, that's important because...

479
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
What is it?

480
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,300
What is it? What's happening?

481
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,460
This one's almost dead.
Why?

482
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,380
It looks dehydrated.
It's had no water.

483
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
Isn't there a water trough?

484
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,340
They've kicked it over.

485
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,540
How could this have happened?
All too easily.

486
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,520
Should I fetch the pig man?

487
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,540
I could run back to the house?
If only we'd brought a car!

488
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,380
There's no time.
Where's the nearest clean water?

489
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,340
There's a water pipe, in the barn.
Should we drive the animals to it?

490
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,360
When they've had no water this long
you must give it to them gradually.

491
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,320
Wait a moment.

492
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,460
Oh!

493
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,340
I'm sorry about that earlier.

494
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,460
You can't blame him
for having a bit of fun.

495
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,480
There won't be much fun for them
after the election.

496
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,420
What do you care,
if you're a Socialist?

497
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm not sure what I am,

498
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,340
except a man in search
of a better world.

499
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,380
Why did you leave Ireland?
Sometimes I ask myself that.

500
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,380
Will you go back?
No.

501
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,300
Why not?
It's a long story.

502
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,300
I'd better go.
Thanks for the seat. Goodnight.

503
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,480
Does no-one care
whether I live or die?

504
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,460
There, there.

505
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,480
This will make you feel better.
Hmm?

506
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,440
Compared to what?

507
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,360
Oh!

508
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,540
I'm fine.

509
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm fine!

510
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,540
Suit yourself.

511
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,340
I'm off. Erm...

512
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,460
Well done, for containing
the Downton heart-breaker.

513
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,380
Everyone's gone to bed,

514
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,420
but Lady Mary's still out
with Mr Blake.

515
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,380
What should I do about locking up?
I wonder what's taking the time.

516
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,480
Nothing.

517
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,480
Well, nothing like that.

518
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,460
I should leave the front door open
with the key in the lock.

519
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,500
They can turn it when they come in.
You're not frightened of burglars?

520
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,380
Mr Carson, this is England.

521
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,520
Hmph.

522
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,400
Are they going to be all right?
I think so.

523
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,420
I'll watch them for another hour
and give them one more drink.

524
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,400
But you, you should go.
I'm not going! They're my pigs.

525
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,320
Oh.

526
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,440
Here, take my coat.
At least it's dry.

527
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,460
Not quite the evening we planned.

528
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,360
Oh.

529
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,300
What do I look like?

530
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,500
You belong in Country Life.

531
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,460
"Lady Mary Crawley,

532
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,300
"seen here to advantage relaxing
at the family seat in Yorkshire."

533
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
Ha, ha.

534
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,380
Oh!

535
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,380
Where have you been?

536
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,520
Having such a dreamy time.

537
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,380
Is she furious that I missed dinner?

538
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,440
Why can't you just fit in for once?
Shall I go and make my peace.

539
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,420
Good night, Rose.

540
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,400
Who'd have thought it?

541
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,320
I can scramble eggs,
but that's about it.

542
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,420
I suspect Carson had plans for this,
but too bad.

543
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,400
I don't deserve such attention.
You certainly do.

544
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,520
You've completely saved our bacon.
Literally!

545
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,420
So, you're a practical farmer,
as well as a theoretician.

546
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
Not sure I was expecting that.

547
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,460
I didn't expect to see you
as a cook and a water carrier.

548
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,300
A night of discovery.

549
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,480
Good discoveries. For me, anyway.

550
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,420
I love how they've all gone to bed,

551
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,500
without the slightest
concern about us.

552
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,300
What did they think we were doing?

553
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,500
We went for a walk and vanished.
Who knows what they thought?

554
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,320
I'm ever so sorry, m'lady.
Please, don't apologise...

555
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,480
Ivy, m'lady.

556
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,340
Ivy.

557
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Well, if you're getting up,
it's time for us to go to bed.

558
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,460
Would you please tell Anna
I'll ring when I'm awake?

559
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,380
Good night.

560
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,540
Good night.

561
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,440
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

562
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
It's right.

563
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,400
This is it.
It doesn't look very right.

564
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,400
It should say Thompson on the bell.

565
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,480
Well, here goes.

566
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,500
If you'll wait, the doctor will be
with you very soon.

567
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,300
As long as he is a doctor.

568
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,360
You don't have to stay.
Of course I do.

569
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,340
Would you like a glass of water?

570
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,440
No, thank you.

571
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,460
It's not that I don't love him,
you know.

572
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,400
I do love him...

573
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,500
..and I would have loved his baby.

574
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,460
But, I just...

575
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,380
..can't see over the top of this.

576
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,320
No.

577
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,520
I don't want to be an outcast.

578
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,460
I don't want to be some funny woman
living in Maida Vale

579
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,480
people never talk about.

580
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,440
Sybil might have brought it off,
but not me.

581
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,320
Oh no, I see that.

582
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
But, you think I'm terribly selfish.

583
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,300
Please don't put words into my mouth.

584
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,460
I don't know what I think,

585
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,360
except that I wish it were over.

586
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,520
I can't go back to the nursery.

587
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,340
Not with Mary's son and Sybil's
daughter waiting there.

588
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,340
I can't do that.

589
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,460
I won't be able to do that.

590
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
Not for a while.

591
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,320
Not for ever, I don't think.

592
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,300
The doctor's just...
I'm afraid this is a mistake.

593
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,480
There's no reason...
I'm sorry to waste your time but...

594
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,520
This is a mistake.

595
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
It seems it was a mistake.

596
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,460
Why?! Why has everything changed?
I've arranged things for tonight!

597
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,380
Then un-arrange them.
Why should I?

598
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,340
Because I'm telling you to.
Just do it, dear.

599
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,320
Are you going to tell Cora?

600
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,460
I suppose I must do, at some stage.

601
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,380
If you want me to be there,
let me know.

602
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm certain there's a way forward.
Certain of it.

603
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,380
Well, the decision's been made now.

604
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,380
- You've heard about our adventures?
- I'm very impressed.

605
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,420
- There you are!
- I'm afraid I slept late.

606
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,420
Have you remembered
Tony Gillingham's coming tonight?

607
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,420
What? Why?
He's driving up to fish the Spey.

608
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,520
He asked if he could stay the night.
I'm sure I told you.

609
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,380
Did he used to be Tony Foyle?
That's right. Why?

610
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,300
We served together in the war
on the Iron Duke with Jellicoe.

611
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,420
Were you at Jutland?
We were.

612
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Well, you'll see him again tonight.

613
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,380
I tried to put him off, but he
didn't seem to want to be put off.

614
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Don't worry. It's perfectly fine.

615
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,380
I gather you were the heroine
of the pig drama.

616
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
So, I'm not aloof now?
Not a bit.

617
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,440
Mucking in with the best of them.
Only trouble for me is...

618
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,400
I'm afraid it's increased
the competition.

619
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,380
Hello, Daisy. Hello, Ivy.

620
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,520
We thought you weren't coming.
Mr Carson warned me about the 'flu.

621
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,380
What 'flu?

622
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,520
Mrs Patmore and I both think we're
coming down with the 'flu, don't we?

623
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,340
We do, indeed, and we're wanting to
spare Alfred from it if we could.

624
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,460
You look well enough to me.

625
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,320
Looks can be deceptive.

626
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,460
We're so pleased to see you.
Aren't we? Daisy? Jimmy?

627
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,460
We've missed you.
I don't know about that.

628
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,380
Have you really missed me, Ivy?
Oh, I have.

629
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,320
The place isn't the same
without you, is it, Daisy?

630
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,300
If I thought you meant that,
I'm not sure I could go.

631
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,320
Which makes it sadder you have to.
You're right. I can't stay long.

632
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,300
I've got to get back to London.
I should have come last night.

633
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,480
Mr Carson was being over careful.

634
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Yes, I'm sure that's what it was.

635
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,440
Alfred? What are you doing here?

636
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,380
He, he thought he'd look in,
before he catches the train.

637
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,320
We've warned him about our 'flu!

638
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:49,320
So, we got all the trouble and a bill
to pay at the pub to pay, too!

639
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,300
Oh, go on with you. I'm sure you
don't grudge him a decent dinner.

640
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,380
But I do grudge him
the tears and heartbreak

641
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,380
that'll flavour my puddings
for weeks to come!

642
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,440
Well, you've given me summat
to think about, Ivy, and I will.

643
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,380
That's such good news,
if you really are hungry.

644
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,520
Well, I'm, I'm not ravenous,

645
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,460
but I wouldn't mind
a piece of toast.

646
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,400
I'll ask straight away.
Can't you ring...?

647
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,520
Well, really, really.

648
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,300
Doctor Clarkson, when you go,

649
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,400
would you please take
that mad woman with you?

650
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,300
That mad woman

651
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,480
has refused to leave your side
for the last two days and two nights

652
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,300
and she has not slept nor eaten
since you were taken ill.

653
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
But, there were nurses here?

654
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,460
I remember a nurse wiping my brow.

655
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,540
She was that nurse, Lady Grantham.

656
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,340
But, what about Cora and Mary?

657
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
They offered,

658
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,300
but Mrs Crawley felt she had
more knowledge than they.

659
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,400
I suppose that has a ring of truth.

660
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,440
I've asked them to bring up
some toast and tea.

661
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,340
Now Lady Grantham's a little better,
it's time you had a break.

662
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,440
I might go home and have a bath.
Shall I come back later?

663
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,460
Oh yes... Yes, dear.
That would be very kind.

664
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,500
Good.

665
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,420
I can stay all evening.
Perhaps we can play cards.

666
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,380
Oh...

667
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,360
You will be rewarded in Heaven.

668
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,340
The sooner the better.

669
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,300
I think this is the right place.

670
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,460
Well, if it isn't Mr Gillingham!

671
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,320
Welcome back!
Pull up a chair and sit down.

672
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,420
I suppose you've come
to shake us up again.

673
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,440
Will there be any more
Racing Demon this time?

674
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:52,300
Depends if you're up to it, but I
expect you've all got things to do.

675
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,440
Miss Baxter, I wondered if you...

676
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,380
If I could what?

677
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,320
If you could let me have
some white thread.

678
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,320
I seem to have run out.
Of course.

679
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,420
Go on then.

680
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:11,380
What've you been up to
since we saw you last?

681
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,500
Having fun and games at other
people's expense?

682
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
I'd better not tell you too much.
I don't want to shock the ladies.

683
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,340
I hope you don't mind
my turning up again.

684
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,480
It's the perfect stopping point
between London and Inverness.

685
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,300
I don't mind at all. How are you?

686
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,460
Well, missing you, mainly.

687
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,440
Sounds to me
as if the needle's got stuck.

688
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,400
How's Mabel?

689
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,500
I gather Charles Blake's here.

690
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,500
Of course, you served together.

691
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,480
We don't really know him,

692
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:52,380
but he and Evelyn Napier are
writing a report for the Government.

693
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,420
He'll be up here for a few weeks.
Lucky devil.

694
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,540
Don't get to like him
better than me.

695
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,500
No chance of that.

696
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,420
They're out all day,

697
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,500
and even in the evenings
we've hardly spoken until yesterday.

698
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,480
Erm, what happened yesterday?

699
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:11,300
Some pigs arrived and of course,
as usual, Mr Blake was...

700
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,500
Anyway, what does it matter?

701
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,460
Hello, Charles.
It's good to see you again.

702
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,340
This is nice.
What task brings you to Yorkshire?

703
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,520
Nothing as meaningful as yours.
What report are you working on?

704
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:31,320
Current health of the landed estate.
My usual stamping ground.

705
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,540
So, did you get everything done?

706
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,460
Why do you ask?
No reason.

707
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:41,420
By the time we got back, we looked
as if we'd been wrestling in mud.

708
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,380
- And had you?
- No!

709
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,400
But then, it's always nice to leave
something for another time.

710
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,520
So, what are the chances for Downton?

711
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,480
I'd say they look bright.

712
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,480
Lady Mary and the family mean to
give it everything they've got.

713
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,380
If Mary means to give it
everything she's got,

714
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,460
then that is a very
considerable gift.

715
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,520
I couldn't agree more.

716
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,360
Dinner everyone.

717
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,460
They said you were in here.

718
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,320
What can I do for you, Mrs Hughes?
Nothing. You can do nothing for me.

719
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,400
Because I know who you are
and I know what you've done.

720
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,540
And while you're here,
if you value your life,

721
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,440
I should stop playing the joker
and keep to the shadows.

722
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,420
I'm afraid we were a bit drunk
that night, Anna and I,

723
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,500
so you're right,
we were both to blame.

724
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,360
No, Mr Green.

725
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,300
YOU were to blame and ONLY you.

726
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,360
Does Mr Bates know?

727
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,380
Not that it was you.

728
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,480
Thank you.

729
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,460
Don't you dare thank me!

730
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,380
I've not kept silent for your sake.

731
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,480
I think it's Gin.

732
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,500
Oh, so it is.

733
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,500
I'd forgotten
what a good game this is.

734
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,320
Yes. I'd forgotten.
How long does it go on for?

735
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,500
Oh, ages!
Oh, goody, goody.

736
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,420
Oh, dear. Alfred's relit the taper.

737
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,340
Well, to be young is to have
your heart broken,

738
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,300
in the kitchens at Downton,
like everywhere else.

739
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,320
I've spent half the day brushing
the mud out of his dinner jacket.

740
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,520
Why can't he have his own valet
instead of making work for me?

741
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,480
Anna?

742
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,460
Sorry. Yes. What were you saying?

743
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,320
Mr Blake's evening shoes were
quite a challenge, I can tell you.

744
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,520
I wasn't working here then.
It's a pity. I admire Nellie Melba.

745
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,340
I'd have loved to hear her sing.
You must be joking.

746
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,320
Why? I thought she had
a beautiful voice.

747
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,360
Screaming and screeching, as if her
finger was caught in the door?

748
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,500
I couldn't take it
for one more moment.

749
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,300
So, what did you do?

750
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,420
Well, I came down here for a bit
of peace and quiet, that's what.

751
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,420
Is that more
of the cauliflower cheese?

752
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,500
This morning in Thirsk,
I saw Rose meeting a man.

753
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,360
I'm frightened when Mr Green
and Mr Bates are in the same room.

754
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,340
I think I know how
I can keep the baby.

755
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,340
There's a family who's been at
Downton for years. Very reckless.

756
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,540
You'd never do anything foolish?
Certainly not.

757
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,300
Rosamund told me.
What did she say?

758
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,440
Only that you needed a little
cherishing, that's all.

759
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,500
His lordship's back!

760
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,500
What a relief to be able
to drink in public!

761
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,380
You never had a drink
all the time you were there?

762
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,340
I won't keep it a secret!

763
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,500
All I want is for you
not to lose control of your life.

9999

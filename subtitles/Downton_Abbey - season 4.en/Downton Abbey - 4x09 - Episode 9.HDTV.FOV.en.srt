(SIGHS)

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,700
You'll never guess
what's happened now.

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,700
Mrs Bute's been taken ill and
she won't be back again for weeks.

4
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,660
What does that mean? They want me in
London to take over

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,710
and they've asked for you
to go with me.

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,640
I thought they only needed us
to help with Lady Rose's ball.

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,500
The plans have changed,
so you're coming with me

8
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,670
and Ivy can stay to cook
for Mr Branson and Lady Edith.

9
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
Why does Lady Edith look so tired?

10
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,550
She goes away for eight months
to Geneva and comes back looking
more tired than when she left.

11
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,580
We're all tired.

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,660
We're not as tired
as we're going to be.

13
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,610
I might go with them. I must look
into Michael's office now I'm back.

14
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,630
Come with me.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,610
No. I have things to do.

16
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,530
Don't imagine for one minute
you can get out of the ball.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,630
Why wasn't Grantham House sold
when Downton was in trouble?

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,580
It would have been, eventually, but
not for nearly enough to save us.

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,610
So thank God for Matthew.

20
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,570
Dear Matthew.

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,570
I do miss him.

22
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,500
Are you looking forward to it?
Why would I be?

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,630
What difference does it make
if you peel potatoes in London
or peel them in Yorkshire?

24
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Huh!

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,730
Can you do me a favour
when you're in London?

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,570
Tell Miss Baxter that I'm looking
forward to hearing the stories
she's got to tell me.

27
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,530
That's an odd message. What stories?
Just tell her. She'll understand.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,610
I'm going up on Tuesday. Robert's
got me invited to the supper
after the presentation.

29
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,690
Lucky you. When are you going
to London? Tomorrow, I think.

30
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,510
I must get some clothes
now I'm back to normal shape.

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,510
I...

32
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,520
I know we never talk about the baby.

33
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,660
But I realise it must be
on your mind constantly.

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,570
Can we please say she and not "it"?

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,700
I wish you hadn't been away so long.

36
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,690
They thought it helps the baby,
to be weaned by her real mother.

37
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,570
Yes. Well, I'm sure everything
worked out for the best.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,580
After all,
your French must be "superbe"!

39
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,610
That's right, Granny. Let's get back
to what really matters.

40
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,550
Do we have to go to this?
Of course we do.

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,520
If Lady Wimborne gives
a concert and a dinner,

42
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,670
then we should be grateful.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,510
When does the American contingent
arrive?

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,500
And how on earth
are we going to manage them?

45
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,700
Don't be ashamed of my mother.
She's your grandmother.

46
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,500
It's very kind of them
to come over for my ball.
You haven't met her yet.

47
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,550
And where will everyone sleep?
This place isn't designed
for house parties. We'll manage.

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,700
Perhaps you could share with Edith?
You're joking?

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,610
Well, someone may have to sleep on
the top floor, with the servants.

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,690
I'd rather sleep on the roof
than share with Edith.

51
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,720
Come on, we're going to be late.

52
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,740
Carson, all this kerfuffle is making
a lot of extra work for the staff,

53
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,550
so I'd like you to plan some sort of
outing for them after the ball,

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,740
before we go home.
Very good, Your Ladyship.

55
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,510
Oh, by they way, Madeleine Allsopp
asked if I'd go on
to the Embassy afterwards.

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,700
Tonight, after the dinner?
You don't mind, do you?

57
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,720
Rose, once we get past Tuesday -
I don't think you have to be
presented to go to the Embassy Club.

58
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,650
I do love Ambrose And His Orchestra.
Please!

59
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,640
Your niece is a flapper. Accept it.
I'm not a flapper.

60
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,610
But can I go?

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,560
Lord Merton, madam. Oh, golly!

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,560
Have I forgotten some plan?

63
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,720
No, no. I'm on my way
to dine with the Scroops

64
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,730
and I'm early.

65
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,580
I was driving through the village.
Thank goodness.

66
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,550
I thought I might have to rush
upstairs and bedeck myself out
in family jewels.

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,630
After 30 years with Lady Merton,
I'm proof against teasing.

68
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,570
I'm sorry about my humble soup.

69
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,660
Is there anything I can offer you?
No, thank you.

70
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,500
I just wondered if you were going
to Rose's ball?

71
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,510
I'm invited but I doubt it.

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,580
Pity. I thought if you were,
I'd make up my mind to go too.

73
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,570
A debutante's ball in high society
is not really my natural habitat,
Lord Merton.

74
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,710
I'm much duller and more serieuse
than you seem to think.

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,510
You may be serieuse,
the rest I would question.

76
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Enough. I leave you to the delights
of your soup.

77

(JAZZ BAND PLAYING)

78
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,650
Where? Oh, there they are.

79
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,700
Oh, no. What is it? There's my father
and he's seen me.

80
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,510
I think it's rather wild to find
your father in a nightclub.

81
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,620
You wouldn't if it were
a weekly occurrence.

82
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,510
Can't we just wave hello and leave
it at that?

83
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,510
Don't you see whom he's with?

84
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,530
The Prince of Wales!

85
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,530
Your Royal Highness, may I present
my daughter, Madeleine?

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,690
Mrs Dudley Ward,
my daughter, Madeleine.

87
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,730
And this is...?

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,520
Lady Rose MacClare.

89
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,690
Your father must be Shrimpie
Flintshire. He is, Your Royal
Highness. Good old Shrimpie.

90
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,630
Won't you join us?
We'd be honoured, sir.

91
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,670
How's old Shrimpie getting on?
Pretty well, I think.

92
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,500
Do you know, he put me up in Bombay
last year when I was touring India?

93
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,710
He wrote and told me all about it.
Your visit was a great honour.

94
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,690
I don't know about that.
He was very hospitable.

95
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,620
But I'm afraid I found it
so beastly hot.

96
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,510
How in the name of blazes
does he stand it?

97
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,500
I'm not sure he has much choice
in the matter, sir.

98
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,500
No, indeed.
No choice at all, poor devil.

99
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,500
I can't tell you how pleased I am
to have some reinforcements.

100
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,510
He was rather grouchy. Now look
what a difference you've made.

101
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,580
Have you got everything, Daisy?
I think so.

102
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:21,590
Well, good luck, then.
I'll see you in London.

103
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,520
Goodbye.

104
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,700
Any orders for Ivy, sir?
Something simple for lunch.

105
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,670
But I'll go down to the pub
for my dinner.

106
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,720
I don't want to make any trouble.

107
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,690
Hello! What brings you here?

108
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,630
I hope to give Mary lunch
and take her to the viewing
of the Summer Exhibition.

109
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,730
It's a special one, isn't it?
My niece is going.

110
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,740
What a nice surprise for Mary.
It's not quite a surprise.

111
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,630
We arranged it last week.
What's all this?

112
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Things for Rose. They didn't dare
take them down the service steps.

113
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,740
Some people have all the luck.

114
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,540
Make sure you're back in time
for Grandmama. (SIGHS)

115
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,560
Does Mr Branson want anything else?
He says not.

116
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,600
And he's having his dinner
in the village.

117
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,610
Marvellous, isn't it?
One minute he's the chauffeur,

118
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,710
and in the normal way of things,
he'd be below me now.

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,700
But instead I have to wait on him
hand and foot,

120
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,580
standing there while he decides
what might please him next.

121
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,620
He never strikes me
as being like that.

122
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,620
He always seems friendly.

123
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,680
But we still have to call him sir.

124
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,680
Oh, Lord, Mrs Levinson's arrived.
Who's that man with the fur collar?

125
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,670
That must be Her Ladyship's brother.

126
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,600
Help me get everything down
and don't make a noise.

127
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,570
Mr Start will give us a hand.

128
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,620
Grandmama, you're here already.
Mama said you were coming later.

129
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,630
Obviously she thought so,
as did everyone else.

130
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,550
Carson tells me there's no-one
in the house to receive me.

131
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,500
Well, I'm here now.
How was your journey?

132
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,660
How would it be
when my maid turned in her notice
just as we were leaving?

133
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,720
Why? Who knows why these people do
what they do.

134
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,620
Carson, can we help? Shall we let
Mrs Hughes get inside, My Lady,

135
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,530
and then she can make a plan?

136
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,570
Mrs Hughes, I didn't know you were
running this house too.

137
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,710
Not as a rule, madam,
but Mrs Bute is ill,

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,560
so I am to take charge
until she's better.

139
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,640
Well, I'm glad at least one person
under this roof knows
what on earth is going on.

140
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,500
Come on.
You're Uncle Harold, aren't you?

141
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,500
Ah... It seems mad that we've never
met before.

142
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,510
Well, I haven't felt the need
to leave America

143
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,740
and to be honest, I don't feel
the need to leave it now.

144
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,520
Grandmama thought it might be fun
for you to see a bit of the season.

145
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,500
You may not know me but I suspect
you've heard enough to grasp

146
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,510
that watching debutantes in
a ballroom is not my kind of fun.

147
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,500
No, but every now and then it's nice
to try something new, isn't it?

148
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,650
Well, maybe it is
and maybe it ain't.

149
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,500
I'm Jimmy, one of the footmen.
Do you need a hand?

150
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,630
How do you do?
Ethan Slade, valet to Mr Levinson.

151
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,600
What about you? Do you work here?

152
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,550
I work at the house in Yorkshire
but I'm up here for a bit.

153
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,630
Are you a lady's maid?
No, I'm in the kitchen.

154
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,700
Because we're in need of
a lady's maid and pronto,

155
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,500
preferably with skin
like a rhinoceros.

156
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,690
Daisy is our assistant cook
and I'm Mrs Hughes, the house-keeper.

157
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,570
Do you know London? I've never
crossed the Atlantic before.

158
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,550
Well, I hope you enjoy yourself.

159
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,500
Are you excited? I'm never excited.

160
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,620
That boiler sounds as if
it's about to blow up.

161
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,570
Do I hear the sound of salvation?

162
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,710
Salvation or chaos. I've just met
Mrs Levinson on the steps.

163
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,640
She's here without a maid.

164
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,690
What happened to the last one?
She had her head bitten off
one time too many.

165
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,510
Miss Baxter, could you go up
and settle Mrs Levinson in?

166
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,580
I don't mind
but she and Her Ladyship will
have to make allowances.

167
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,700
I don't think making allowances is
what Mrs Levinson is famous for.

168
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,560
Ooh, you're a sight for sore eyes.

169
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,650
We've a dinner tonight
and an at-home after,
so there's plenty to do.

170
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,570
What's an at-home? People pop by
for music and chat and so on.

171
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,730
We serve a light supper at eleven
but we never know for how many,

172
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
so we've got to be flexible.

173
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,720
Hello, Mr Molesley.
I hope life's treating you well.

174
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,520
Half the time there's nothing to do,
then it's all hands to the pump

175
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,630
but I don't mind that.

176
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,680
Thomas sent a message. He says he's
looking forward to hearing the
stories you're going to tell him.

177
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,700
What stories? I don't know.
That's what he said.

178
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,610
So what new scheme are you working
on to beat down the upper classes?

179
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,500
You think me much more
of a Robespierre than I am.

180
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,500
Well, I suppose I must accept
that in a post-war world

181
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,660
we toffs are the villains
of every story.

182
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,560
And do you think that's how I feel?
Well, I hope you make exceptions.

183
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,590
Naturally,
I exempt all pig-rescuers. Hmm.

184
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,540
Hello. What's Tony Gillingham doing
here? Talking to Rose, apparently.

185
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,690
You never said you were coming
to this.

186
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,630
Well, I'm glad I have some secrets.

187
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Mary, do you know Mrs Dudley Ward?
My cousin, Lady Mary Crawley.

188
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:37,690
How did you come across Rose?
We met through Billy Aysgarth.
Madeleine Allsopp's father.

189
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,510
I've asked them both to come
tonight. Have you told Mama?

190
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,680
I will when I get back.

191
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,630
Have you met Charles Blake?
I know Mr Blake.

192
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,720
Are you going to this grande soiree,
Gillingham? I am.
Mm. You kept that under your hat.

193
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,530
Dear me. We seem to be
the only people not invited.

194
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,730
What do you think we've done wrong?
Er... You'd be very welcome,

195
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:00,520
if you wanted to come.
Won't Lady Grantham mind?

196
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,620
Do I spy a dog in the manger?
Not at all.

197
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,660
A dog in the manger tries to protect
a thing he has no use for,

198
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,740
whereas I am looking forward
to this evening very much indeed.

199
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,560
Play nicely, children.

200
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,590
Do you know how these things work?

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,730
There's a dinner first and then most
people arrive after half past nine.

202
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
Then I shall do what most people do.

203
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,640
Am I glad to see you! We've been
struggling a bit without Mrs Bute.

204
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,560
And will Mrs Levinson's arrival
make things simpler, do you think?

205
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,700
I... As a matter of fact,
I'd value your opinion.

206
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,620
Her Ladyship has asked me to organise

207
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:42,610
a treat for the staff after the ball
as a thank you.

208
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,530
Well, that's very kind.

209
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,570
They've started opening the new
Science Museum in South Kensington,

210
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,500
even though it's not finished,

211
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,570
and I can't decide between that

212
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,720
and a visit to the Crystal Palace
on its new site at Sydenham Hill.

213
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,570
I see. And this is a fun day
as a thank you, is it?

214
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,640
Yes. I think it's very generous.
So do I.

215
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,690
Very generous indeed.

216
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,730
Maybe you should try your ideas
on the staff,

217
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,500
see what they jump at.

218
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,570
Hmm.

219
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,500
Mother! I'm so sorry. I thought
you said you'd be here after five.

220
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,730
Well, we just got away early.

221
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,510
I didn't think I had to make
an appointment.

222
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,650
I had a last fitting and...

223
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,620
Hello, Harold. Hello.

224
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,680
How are you?
A long way from home is how I am.

225
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,710
Harold and I will be spending
some time seeing Europe -

226
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,560
Madrid, Rome, Paris -

227
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,740
and we will enjoy ourselves.

228
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,720
I hope so but somehow I doubt it.

229
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,500
And this is because you
want to put a little space between
you and the Teapot Dome business?

230
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,590
Oh, let's not bring that up again.
It should've have worked.

231
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,570
I'm not much in a drawing room
but I am good at business -

232
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,560
Harold, Harold, we... No.

233
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,580
We came 3,500 miles
so we could change the subject.

234
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,610
(BELL TOLLING)

235
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,710
Can I help you with that?

236
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,550
I was carrying too many.

237
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,620
You've been avoiding me.

238
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,690
No, I haven't, I've just been busy
these past few months.

239
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,510
Anyway, I'm here now.

240
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,710
I'll get on with this marking.
I'm going to the pub
to get something to eat.

241
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,500
Why don't you join me?

242
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,710
I assume Edith got off all right?
Yes, she did

243
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,540
and she took Mrs Hughes and Daisy
with her.

244
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,700
I'm just going to the Grantham Arms
to get some dinner. Oh.

245
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,700
May I present Miss Bunting?
She teaches at the school.

246
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,680
Does she?

247
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:50,500
I wanted to say goodbye.
I may not see you before I go.

248
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,500
Ah!

249
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,560
My niece is being presented
on Tuesday.

250
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,550
I'm joining them for the supper
afterwards at the Palace.

251
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,730
How nice.

252
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,500
And you're coming up later
for her ball, aren't you, Branson?

253
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,640
Mm. We're off! So sorry.

254
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,720
Well, I'll say my goodbyes.
Does the offer of dinner
still stand?

255
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,510
Hmm.

256
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,540
Right, the first course is ready
to go up.

257
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,560
The souffle mix is done
for the savoury

258
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,620
and I'll make a bechamel
for the cauliflower.

259
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,670
Thank God for you, Daisy. I've never
known your true value till now.

260
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,610
You seem to be in charge,
not like an assistant at all.

261
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,690
We've worked together a long time.
Ever thought of going it alone?

262
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,660
Do you always try
and change people's lives after
you've known them half an hour?

263
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,660
Mr Levinson, might I ask if you'd be
willing to play the footman
on occasion while you're here?

264
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,740
What? Not every day but when
we have a big evening, like tonight

265
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,670
or Lady Rose's ball.

266
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,640
It's normal in England for the valets
to help out in this way

267
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,640
but it may not be in America.

268
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,640
We don't entertain much but OK.
You're very kind.

269
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,620
I brought some spare liveries
with me,

270
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,700
if you ask James or Molesley
to show you.

271
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:09,520
I will. And, Mr Carson, my employer
is called Levinson, not me.

272
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,650
In this house, you both are.

273
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,670
She was not seeing you off.
Sounded like it.

274
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,590
Have you found her very hard?

275
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,630
Losing Sybil was hard.

276
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,730
Compared to that,
everything else has been easy.

277
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,570
Will you show me the house? What?

278
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,700
Oh. Aren't you allowed
to bring your friends back?

279
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,540
It's not a question
of being allowed.
Then what is it a question of?

280
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,720
Yes, quite.

281
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,660
I wish Tom had arrived.
It's so nice to hear you say that.

282
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,580
No, I mean, he's bringing Isis
and I do miss her.

283
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,500
Do you know Lady Grantham's mother,
Mrs Levinson, and her son?

284
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,570
This is Lord Aysgarth.
A pleasure.

285
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,570
It's quite a crowd.
Yes, but plenty of old friends.

286
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,520
Excuse me.

287
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,670
That's Lord Harrowby. They haven't
seen each other for ages.

288
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,710
He clearly thinks that Lord Harrowby
is more alluring than we are.

289
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,540
The Lady Rosamund Painswick
and Mr Terence Sampson.

290
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,570
What the devil...? I looked in
at the Warwicks on my way here.

291
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,740
And Mr Sampson was saying that he'd
stayed at Downton not long ago,

292
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,570
so I made him come with me.
She wouldn't take no for an answer.

293
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,590
We're happy to see you here,
Mr Sampson. Thank you.

294
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,720
Do you know Lord Aysgarth?
I do. Sampson and I are old friends.

295
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,610
How are you, Billy?

296
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,740
Did you really keep it a secret from
Charles you were coming tonight?

297
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,550
I didn't keep it a secret,
I just didn't tell him.

298
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,610
You certainly don't give up easily.

299
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,680
Well, I won't give up at all.

300
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,730
You're in for a dry night.
No bad thing around this family.

301
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,620
I had a nasty brush with them
up in Yorkshire last year.

302
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,510
Who are they? Lady Grantham's mother
and brother,

303
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,560
over from America, I suppose.
Interesting.

304
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,530
It would be if he plays cards. Why?
They're absolutely made of money.

305
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,530
How do you think the Downton roof
still keeps out the rain?

306
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,690
Do you hear that, Madeleine?

307
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,610
Would you care for one of these?
I think they're quite nice.

308
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,610
Have you lost your mind?
Why? What have I done?

309
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,570
You're a footman,
not a travelling salesman.

310
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,650
Please keep your opinions
on the catering to yourself.

311
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,560
(SIGHS)

312
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,730
How's it going?
Her Ladyship seems pleased.

313
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,730
We're taking up the buffet now.
I only hope we've got enough.

314
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,710
Dinner, supper and no doubt
a big breakfast tomorrow?

315
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,570
It's a wonder they're not all
the size of a tub.

316
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh, Anna, there's an appeal
at the Scottish church
in Pont Street for old clothes.

317
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,530
They're collecting
for Russian refugees.

318
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,580
You won't have brought anything with
you that you'd want to throw away

319
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,630
but you might spread the word.
Of course.

320
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,600
I've been on at Mr Bates to take
advantage of being in London
and get a few things.

321
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,560
Trouble is, he does hate shopping.
That must be because he's a man.

322
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,510
Do you know England well,
Mr Levinson? Er, not really.

323
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,730
He hasn't been here
since my daughter got married.

324
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,660
But don't worry. I'm well prepared
for cold baths, warm drinks

325
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,610
and, most of all, the food.

326
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,600
As I said, he doesn't travel much.

327
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,620
They're going into supper.
Harold, why don't you take
Miss Allsopp into the dining room?

328
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,730
Well...

329
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,510
You needn't if you don't want to.

330
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,550
Are you determined to put me off?

331
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,600
OK! Well, if that's what you want.

332
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,530
So shall we? I don't see why not.

333
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,590
Why not what?

334
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Some of us are going on
to the Embassy later.

335
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,550
Oh, what fun.

336
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,580
Oh, well, you can come,
if you'd like. I will.

337
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,710
Why is Sampson here?
Aunt Rosamund brought him.

338
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,700
Papa's livid but there's nothing
to be done. He can't make a scene.

339
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:21,710
I sometimes feel
we should make more scenes

340
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,740
about things
that really matter to us.

341
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,680
Wouldn't be very English.
No, but I envy it.

342
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,690
All those Latins screaming
and shouting

343
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,560
and hurling themselves
into graves.

344
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,650
I bet they feel much better
afterwards.

345
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,680
I wonder. I think
once you've let it out
it must be hard to get it back in.

346
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,570
Let's go through.

347
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,730
But when do you use this?
This is our sitting room, really.

348
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,570
The drawing room is more formal.

349
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,530
This is for tea or writing letters
or anything like that.

350
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,660
(CHUCKLES) I'd feel as if
I were having tea
in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

351
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,720
No, it's nice, when everyone's here
and the fire's going.

352
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,720
And I'll bet you say
you haven't changed.

353
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,560
So you've seen everything.
Well, the main rooms.

354
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,670
Let me just look down
from the gallery,

355
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,600
then you can take me home.

356
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,690
I'm sorry. I feel a bit awkward,
to be honest,

357
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,540
with them all being away.

358
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,700
Well, I...
I asked if it was allowed.

359
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,740
It's not that, really.

360
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,520
Are they all for the Crawleys?
These are the marriages.

361
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,630
One side's Crawley and the other is
the arms for every Countess.

362
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,510
And the present Lady Grantham?
I don't see one with a dollar sign.

363
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,510
Can I help, sir?

364
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,730
Er, no.

365
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,540
We were just going down.
That is, we only just came up.

366
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,520
And now we're going down again.
Whatever you say, sir.

367
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,610
I'm taking Miss Bunting home. Please
don't lock up till I get back.

368
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,660
Very good, sir.

369
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,700
You did well. Everyone was saying
how delicious the kedgeree was.

370
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,710
Well, that were Daisy's work.
Mr Levinson had three helpings

371
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,510
and he thought he wouldn't
care for English food.

372
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,660
You've converted him, Daisy,
and that's something to be proud of.

373
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,590
What's so funny?
Freda was showing us a letter.

374
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,620
What's so special about a letter?
Because of who wrote it.

375
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,680
Rose, you must be tiddly.
Oh, I think I am a bit.

376
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,610
It's my fault.
I never should have mentioned it.

377
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,690
Isn't anyone going to dance?
Mr Levinson,

378
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,680
Madeleine's dying to dance.

379
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,660
Will you rescue her?
Oh, I watch dancing, I don't do it.

380
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,530
I don't believe that. Off you go!

381
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,540
And what about you, Freda? If you
promise not to step on my toes.

382
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,510
I'm afraid Father forced me on you.
Oh, don't worry. I'm used to it.

383
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,560
Used to what? Fathers wanting me
to dance with their daughters.

384
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,560
Would you care to dance? Oh, there's
Nell Foster! How topping.

385
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:51,650
Can you look after our bags?
Of course.

386
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,520
There's no need for you to stay.
I like to keep an eye on things,
sir.

387
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,710
Do it Mr Carson's way.

388
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,730
Only last night...

389
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:24,700
I was concerned
you may have misunderstood.

390
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,740
Sir?

391
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,700
I was having dinner
with Miss Bunting in the village

392
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,560
and she was curious
to look around the house...

393
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,540
..Mr Barrow.

394
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,570
She might perhaps see it to
more advantage in the daylight, sir.

395
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,530
Yes. And I'm sure she'll be back.

396
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:52,510
The point is we only went upstairs

397
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,670
so she could enjoy the view
down into the hall.

398
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,700
I wouldn't want you to think
any different.

399
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,640
However you wish to command me,
I am your servant, Mr Branson,

400
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:05,720
but I was not aware I was under
orders as to what I might think.

401
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,720
I thought I might arrive and find
you'd already left for London.

402
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,670
As a matter of fact, I'm going up
this morning with Lady Grantham.

403
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:23,510
I wanted to say you were kind
to write. That's all, really.

404
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,600
Well, when I decided to go
to Rose's ball,

405
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,660
I felt it was wrong not to tell you,
since you'd asked.

406
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,640
What changed your mind?
I suppose it came to me

407
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:36,500
that these balls and presentations
and comings out

408
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,710
are not just aristocratic folderol
but traditions

409
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,590
by which members of this family
measure their progress through life.

410
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,550
And you wanted to be part of that?

411
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,690
Well, I felt by dismissing it
as trivia,

412
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,740
I was being smug and intolerant.

413
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,620
Do they know what they have in you?
I know what I have in them.

414
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
So, have you decided whether or not
you will come to the ball?

415
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,520
Oh, how can you ask?
Of course I will!

416
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:07,710
But I don't understand.
How can you suddenly be an editor?

417
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,570
I won't be, not in that way,

418
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,630
but Michael gave me
power of attorney.

419
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,660
It didn't matter before
but now they need some decisions.

420
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,530
And you'll have to make them
until he...?

421
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,720
Well, until either he comes back
or...

422
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,660
Is there a will, do you know?
It might be useful.

423
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,560
To help you find out what he wanted.

424
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,510
Wants. I'm sure there is but...

425
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,580
I don't know what's in it yet.

426
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,560
I'll find out.

427
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,620
But what about his child?
Doesn't she have some rights?

428
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,500
His child is not his child any more
or yours.

429
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,510
She belongs
to nice Mr and Mrs Schroder

430
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,580
and lives in Geneva
with the rest of her family.

431
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,610
It's all very well saying that
but it doesn't change anything.

432
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:06,550
Only because you won't let it.

433
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,740
There was no formal agreement.
Maybe not

434
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,510
but it wouldn't be fair to the
Schroders to go back on your word.

435
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,730
Dear Aunt Rosamund, I'm so grateful
for all you've done

436
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:21,670
and I'm not pulling rank but the fact
remains, you've never been a mother.

437
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,610
You'll never guess.
Oh, try. What is it?

438
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,640
Alfred's finished his course
and they've taken him on.
What, permanent at the Ritz?

439
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:36,540
As an under chef.
But that won't be for long.

440
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,670
He's going to be famous.
Whoo-hoo! Who is?

441
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,510
Alfred Nugent.
He was a footman at Downton

442
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,590
but he's working at the Ritz now.
He's on his way.

443
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,640
That seems quite
the American dream to me -

444
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,660
poor boy from the sticks
becomes famous hotelier.

445
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,520
Well, I don't know if it's American
or not but I think it's smashing.

446
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,600
..was still here. Nonsense.

447
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,740
What's he doing?
Oh, he just came to see me off.

448
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,510
Huh! But we mustn't lose any time
or we'll miss our train.

449
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,570
I know I'm late.
It couldn't be helped.

450
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:19,660
Cora insisted I come without a maid.

451
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:23,600
I can't believe she understood
the implications. Which are?

452
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,680
How do I get a guard
to take my luggage?

453
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,700
And when we arrive in London,
what happens then?

454
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,550
Fear not.
I've never travelled WITH a maid.

455
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,510
You can share my knowledge
of the jungle.

456
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,710
Can't you even offer help

457
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,640
without sounding like a trumpeter on
the peak of the moral high ground?

458
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,650
And must you always sound like
the sister of Marie-Antoinette?

459
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,570
The Queen of Naples was
a stalwart figure.

460
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,610
I take it as a compliment.

461
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,500
You take everything as a compliment.
I advise you to do the same.

462
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,550
It saves many an awkward moment.

463
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,530
Goodbye.

464
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,630
Success. I have finally persuaded
Mr Bates to buy a new overcoat,

465
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,570
so the refugees can have this.
That's just what they need.

466
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,530
Are you sure? Take it. He'd only go
on wearing it if it's in the house.

467
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,680
Well, they'll be very grateful.
I'd better get back.

468
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,580
There's always plenty of fuss
before a presentation.

469
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,670
There is but I think it's exciting.

470
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,730
Seems odd to me that a courtesy
and a nod from the throne

471
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,620
can turn you from a girl into a woman
but who are we to argue?

472
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,670
Oh!

473
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,670
May I help, Mrs Hughes?
I was just looking for Anna

474
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
but it doesn't matter.

475
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,540
(CHEERING)

476
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,540
Now we have to go our separate ways.

477
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,650
I feel quite nervous. Nonsense.
Onwards to the breach.

478
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:05,560
The Countess of Grantham presenting
the Lady Rose MacClare.

479
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,690
Thank you, Lady Grantham.

480
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,700
I hope you don't want
to powder your nose. Why not?

481
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,520
Because all that's on offer is
a chamber pot behind that screen.

482
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,670
The glamour of court life!

483
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,590
Who's presenting you?
My father's eldest sister.

484
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,700
Aunt Violet wanted to present me
but we got round it.

485
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,680
She'll be at the supper
as a consolation.

486
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,510
Papa's coming.
So are my mother and my brother.

487
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,530
Mr Levinson's here and Mrs Levinson?
How did you manage that?

488
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:37,720
Lord Grantham is
our Lord Lieutenant.

489
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,660
And he pulled a string to get them
in? Father will be so pleased.

490
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:46,600
Madeleine. Gosh, that's me.
Good luck.

491
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,710
So she's in the library
and she's on her own. Are you sure?

492
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,680
What do you want with her?
Nothing that would interest you.

493
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,610
Mr Carson, I wonder...

494
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,550
I'm sorry. Don't mind me.
I'm just leaving.

495
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,670
Can I help?

496
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,600
I wanted to ask you, man to man,

497
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,720
if anything's going on between Daisy
and the fella working at the Ritz.

498
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,550
Going on? Nothing goes on in
any house where I am in authority.

499
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,590
Of course not. I didn't mean that.
What did you mean?

500
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,610
I think you know.
The "fella" is called Alfred.

501
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,570
There is no romance
between him and Daisy.

502
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,700
He has left our employ.
I doubt they'll meet in the future.

503
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:47,590
Because I wouldn't like to push in
where I'm not wanted.

504
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,520
The Duchess of Margam presenting
the Lady Elizabeth Bailey George.

505
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,520
The Countess of Grantham presenting
the Lady Rose MacClare.

506
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,640
Lady Rose is Lord Flintshire's
daughter, sir.

507
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,510
Ah! The Prince of Wales has spoken

508
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,620
about your father's hospitality
in Bombay.

509
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,640
He was honoured to entertain
His Royal Highness, Your Majesty.

510
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,730
The Indian tour was a great success,
thanks to Lord Flintshire.

511
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,580
The Prince did splendidly, sir.
He was so popular wherever he went.

512
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,610
Yes. The Prince is never short
of popularity.

513
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,590
Lady Grantham.

514
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,670
The Countess of Derwentwater
presenting the Lady Jane Radcliffe.

515
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,550
So Bates was in London that day.

516
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,620
You say it as if you already knew.

517
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,520
Does Anna suspect anything?

518
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:45,630
Absolutely not. She knows nothing.

519
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,500
So will you tell her now, My Lady?
I gather you won't.

520
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,660
No. No, I'm handing this to you.

521
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,610
Meaning leave it alone?

522
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,590
We can't know what happened
on that street.

523
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,680
Maybe he was in London
for an innocent reason

524
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,680
and nowhere near Piccadilly.

525
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,670
But this I will say. If he was there
to avenge his wife's honour,

526
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,700
I won't condemn him for it.

527
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,510
I'm sorry but I won't.

528
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,730
Oh! All done?
Presented, photographed, done.

529
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:32,590
You both looked splendid.
You didn't look so bad yourself.

530
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,630
The unfair advantage
of a court position.

531
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,670
I hear the King was very talkative,
for him.

532
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,720
How was the Queen?
You know - she sort of sits there
being Queen Mary-like.

533
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,660
Any chance of meeting them later?
Hardly.

534
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,550
His Majesty is not an admirer
of the New World.

535
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,740
You might do better
with the Prince of Wales.

536
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,690
I'm not one of those Englishmen
who hates New York

537
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,700
but a great city can be
a lonely place.

538
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,710
Can't everywhere? But you'd only
be lonely if you wanted to be.

539
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,550
Do you know Newport?
Why?

540
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,700
I stayed there before the war with
the Duchess of Marlborough's mother.

541
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,660
I thought it was wonderful.
As a matter of fact,
I'm in Newport quite a lot.

542
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,630
I have what they call a cottage
on Bellevue Avenue.

543
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,550
Really? I didn't know.

544
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,690
Didn't you? Huh!

545
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,640
I feel rather guilty
about leaving Isobel behind. Why?

546
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,680
She brought a book with her.
That should keep her occupied.

547
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:32,740
What sort of book?
I can only tell you

548
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,630
that on the train
it was far more interesting than me.

549
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,620
Your father's paying
a lot of attention to my mother.

550
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,620
You think we ought to tell him
she only has an income for life?

551
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,580
You are funny!
Oh, that's right.

552
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,680
The English upper classes never talk
about money. We don't like to.

553
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,630
But you don't mind thinking
about it.

554
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:58,510
Er... Or at least,
your father doesn't.

555
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,570
We should tell him
before he's in too deep.

556
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,510
When she dies, all the capital
reverts to me. He ought to know.

557
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Rose. Oh! Are you at all
the presentation courts?

558
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,710
You are good! There are only four

559
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,640
and David... I mean,
the Prince likes me here.

560
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,650
He said you were very sweet
about him.

561
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,670
Is something the matter?

562
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,540
Do you remember that letter we were
laughing about the other night? Yes.

563
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:39,550
Well, the thing is,
when I got home, it was missing.

564
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,680
It wasn't in my bag
and I know I put it back. I saw you.

565
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,710
I was so hoping
you might have taken it, as a prank.

566
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,660
I won't be a bit cross if you did.
I'm afraid not. Try Madeleine.

567
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,610
It wasn't her. It... It's just...

568
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,730
If it falls into the wrong hands...
No need to explain.

569
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,680
Has anyone been in touch,
asking for money?

570
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:02,650
I wish they had.
Then I'd know how to get it back.

571
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,700
Ah! Do they talk much,
the King and Queen?

572
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:11,670
They were very kind. Well, you're
not presented for conversation.

573
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,700
This is Mrs Dudley Ward.
Of course you are!

574
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,510
Have we met? No. I read about you
in the American newspapers.

575
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,650
Gossip, really.
Nothing to worry about.

576
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,560
But never give them a real story.

577
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,580
How do you do? Harold Levinson.

578
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:43,670
You're mistaken, sir. I'm not Harold
Levinson, whoever he may be.

579
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Er, no, no, no. I'm Harold Levinson.

580
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,650
Then why did you say I was?

581
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,200
Cousin Robert? Mm?

582
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,120
I've got such a funny question.

583
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,190
It seems an awful thing to say

584
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,040
but do you think your friend
Mr Sampson might be capable
of something dishonourable?

585
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,220
He's not my friend.

586
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,160
Why do you ask? Well...

587
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,090
It was when we were at the Palace,
at the supper.

588
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,240
Go on.
Do you remember Mrs Dudley Ward?

589
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,080
Did you notice how upset she was?

590
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,180
He wanted Miss Allsopp to go
on a picnic luncheon in the park?

591
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,120
The picnic was my idea.
He thinks he's offended her
and he wants to make it up.

592
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,180
He can't go on a picnic
with a young lady on her own.

593
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,000
What is he thinking of? Why not?

594
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,010
Because we're not in America
and she isn't a chorus girl.

595
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,210
Don't worry! He's asked her father
and Mrs Levinson to come along.

596
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,210
And who's going to prepare
this picnic, when it's at home?

597
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,080
Daisy can make it!
And come along, to help me serve.

598
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,160
Don't be daft. I work
in the kitchen, I don't serve.

599
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:11,010
Then I'll serve! You get it ready
and set it out and...

600
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,100
I'll serve.
Oh, I see.

601
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,170
You see what? It's not set in stone
that you shouldn't help at a picnic.

602
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,060
I can spare you,
if you think they'll come.

603
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:26,090
Lord Aysgarth will come if he knows
old mother Levinson's aboard.

604
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,110
Oh, very respectful, I must say!

605
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,140
I'll be sorry if he means to revive
the ways of his grandpapa,

606
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:35,110
winking at every beauty
in an opera box.

607
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,200
It must be a lonely job.
All the public want is
a happy marriage at the Palace.

608
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,190
Is it so much to ask?

609
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,160
And anyway, why did Mrs Dudley Ward
have the letter in her handbag?

610
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,020
I expect it was a love thing.
It won't be much of a love thing
when it's in the American papers.

611
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,190
Do you think that's why he took it?
Sampson took it to make money.

612
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:59,040
The question is whether he means
to blackmail Mrs Dudley Ward
or sell it to the foreign press.

613
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,020
No wonder she was in such a state.
I can't tell you what it said.

614
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,130
Don't! I'm a monarchist
and that's why I would like
the letter retrieved

615
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,170
and why I do not wish to know
its contents.

616
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,120
I feel so guilty!

617
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,180
If I hadn't joked about it,
he would never have suspected
it was in her handbag.

618
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:18,210
Good God.

619
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,020
Then we have to do something,
at once.

620
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,220
If we're lucky, the letter will be
at Sampson's flat.

621
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,150
We must get him away from there
and someone must go in and -

622
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,230
Steal it? You can't steal something
that's already been stolen.

623
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,200
But how would we get in?
We can't very well pick the lock.

624
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,170
James, could you please ask Bates
to come to the drawing room?

625
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,060
Are we ready? We are, sir.

626
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,110
Only, Ivy has a basket
of kitchen things to carry

627
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,020
and it will be a bit of a squash
for her and me and the basket
in the front.

628
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,220
You mean, you want to sit next to me
in the back?

629
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:02,120
And if I were His Lordship,
would you ask to sit next to him?

630
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,190
Well, I doubt we'd be in
the same car, sir.

631
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,100
If you were?

632
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,160
We could just tie my basket
on the back.

633
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,220
I think that would be
the best solution.

634
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,220
Good. That's settled, then.

635
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,210
You've made everything I asked for?
It wasn't very complicated.

636
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,060
Mr Levinson does not like
complicated food.

637
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,050
That's why he likes English cooking.

638
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,010
How are you going to manage it,
now old Lady Grantham's going
and Mrs Crawley?

639
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,080
It's a lot of work.
You'd better take James with you.

640
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,230
We can manage with Mr Molesley
for lunch. Yes.

641
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,160
Would you mind? I'm a footman.
I don't have the right to mind.

642
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,120
Thank you, Wat Tyler.

643
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,190
Where are you meeting them?
A place called the Albert Memorial,

644
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,010
but er...will I know it
when I see it?

645
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:51,130
You most certainly will,
I can promise you that.

646
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,180
Now, I've got rugs, cushions
and folding chairs.

647
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:56,130
Come on. You'd better get started.

648
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,040
It's very good of you to spare her.
It won't kill me.

649
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,040
She deserves a bit of luck.

650
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,030
I'm afraid that boy's interest
in her may not be entirely proper.

651
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:12,230
Mr Carson, all women need
someone to show a bit of interest
every now and then,

652
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,040
preferably in a manner
that's not entirely proper.

653
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,120
Hm, hm.

654
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:24,100
Bates, during your time...away,

655
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:27,090
did you ever meet a man
who could copy someone's writing?

656
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,180
Do you mean a forger, My Lord?
Yes, I suppose I do.

657
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:34,050
What would he be required to do?
We have to gain entry
to someone's flat,

658
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,200
so the porter needs to be told
to unlock the door.

659
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,100
The order will come in the form
of a signed note. I see.

660
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,110
I assume we have a sample
of this person's writing.

661
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,110
Do we?
He sent a bread and butter letter
after our party the other night.

662
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,160
Then I can get it done.
How long will it take?

663
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,090
If I can have the letter
straightaway,

664
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,140
I believe I can supply the note
by the end of the afternoon.

665
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,120
So the man is here in London? He is,
My Lord. What a stroke of luck.

666
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:01,000
I know this sounds rather dodgy,
Bates,

667
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,240
but there is nothing underhand
in what we're trying to achieve -
quite the reverse.

668
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,170
Your word is enough for me, My Lord.

669
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,050
Please don't ruin everything,
not when it's over and done
and nobody knows.

670
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,220
Granny knows. Is she going to reveal
the bastard child
of her own granddaughter?

671
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,130
Remember, you were never going to
mention it, even if he came back.

672
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,140
I know I said that but I don't think
I could keep to it now.

673
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,240
Why? Is there some news?

674
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,110
Not really. A bit.

675
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:37,150
It seems he got into a fight
with a gang of toughs

676
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,030
the first night he was in Munich.
A gang of toughs?

677
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,120
They're quite well-known, apparently.

678
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,190
They wear brown shirts and go around
preaching the most horrible things.

679
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,060
Anyway, a man who was there says
that Michael took exception
to what they were saying.

680
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,210
He should have had the sense
to keep out of it.

681
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,000
But surely, if they know these men,

682
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,150
they can question them
and find out what happened.

683
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,140
You'd think so.

684
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,000
Oh, my dear. I can be normal
most of the time for weeks on end

685
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,120
but then I think I might never see
him again and...

686
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:15,140
I know. But that's not the point.

687
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,200
If Michael is dead, if I do inherit,

688
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,010
then I have to give at least half
to the baby.

689
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,130
Don't you see? No, I don't.

690
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,040
But if you really must,
do it anonymously.

691
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,070
It wouldn't be hard.

692
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,220
This is for the best.

693
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,230
If you'll only keep silent,

694
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,120
there'll be other loves,
other children.

695
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,110
Don't cheat yourself of that,
I beg you.

696
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,170
I don't know.

697
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,030
Then trust me...because I do.

698
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,090
What's that you're doing?

699
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,030
Something for His Lordship. Hm.

700
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:17,180
Are you enjoying being in London?
I am.

701
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,080
Makes a nice change.
Oh, it does for me, right enough.

702
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,180
I haven't been here since I buried
my mother, halfway through the war.

703
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:28,020
Has it been that long?

704
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,070
My, my.

705
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,140
Of course I understand
why the letter must be recovered.

706
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,080
I don't see why
it has to involve me.

707
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,190
Someone has to fetch the letter
whilst we distract Sampson.

708
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,230
Can't Rose go?
On her own? Have a heart.

709
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,190
Well, you, then. I'm the one
hosting the card game.

710
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,010
The question is, who else can play?

711
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,050
They must be genuine
or it will smell fishy.

712
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,240
Tony Gillingham would come
but we'd have to tell him.

713
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,070
I know who'd play and bring Sampson
and we needn't say a word.

714
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,220
Lord Aysgarth.
Grandmama can sit on his lap.

715
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:09,050
I don't want her here. She'll make
some crack and give the game away.

716
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:12,080
What can we do with her?

717
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:17,010
Send a note to Rosamund.
Ask her to take Martha to a play.

718
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,230
And Mama and Isobel.

719
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,230
Tell her to give them supper
afterwards.

720
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,090
They'll have to change
once they're back from their picnic,
so we won't be stuck with them long.

721
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,230
I hate to lie.
I'll do it. I don't mind lying.

722
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,140
We ought to give the men dinner.
It will make it more normal.

723
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:36,070
But won't Sampson be suspicious?
He must be aware you don't like him.

724
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,170
I'll tell Aysgarth
that Harold will play.

725
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,010
Fleecing your uncle will be
too tempting for Sampson to resist.

726
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,230
Suppose Uncle Harold would rather go
to the theatre?

727
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,070
Ask Lord Aysgarth
to bring his daughter.

728
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,030
I don't like the idea of you two
setting off to burgle his flat.

729
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,100
I can't allow it. We could ask
Evelyn Napier. He's in France.

730
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:59,240
Mr Blake, then. But I know
what the letter looks like.
Suppose the porter calls the police?

731
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Do you want the heir to the throne
to be lampooned across the world

732
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,190
with a story that will never sleep,

733
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:07,170
even when he's safely crowned
and married to a princess?

734
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:10,170
No, but I do feel he's brought it
down on his own head.

735
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,060
Even if that's true, we introduced
Sampson to Mrs Dudley Ward

736
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,170
and Rose as good as gave him
the letter.

737
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,100
This family is responsible
for the whole ghastly debacle.

738
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,170
(DOOR SLAMS)

739
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,060
The pate was delicious,
now the fish mousse is delicious

740
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,230
and all my life I've been warned off
English food.

741
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:37,240
I'm glad we score in one category.
The menu was very unoriginal.

742
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,020
I like my food good.
I don't want it original.

743
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,020
So England is the right place
for you.

744
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:47,010
So, I know you're a lord
but what kind of lord are you?
There are different kinds?

745
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,200
The British peerage is
a fountain of variety.

746
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:52,130
It's just a lowly barony,
I'm afraid,

747
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,190
but it's quite old.

748
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,170
So you are not Lady Madeleine?

749
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:00,050
No, but she's an Honourable.

750
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,050
Who would doubt it?

751
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,010
So how long is it
before you go home?

752
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:09,190
Late Friday we leave for Paris
and then for Rome.

753
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,190
I envy you, to see Europe
as you will see it.

754
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,160
What do you mean? Drifting
from great hotel to great hotel,

755
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:21,140
no-one to hurry you,
no-one to pester you -

756
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,210
like the world as it used to be.
You mean, with no expense spared.

757
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,160
I meant how charming it would be
to see it with Mrs Levinson.

758
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,200
Another whisky, would you?

759
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,090
Is it going all right?
As far as you're concerned.

760
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,000
But the old lady treats His Lordship
like a bad smell.

761
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,150
Rose says you have
quite a reputation at home.

762
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,220
As a playboy, you mean?

763
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,200
I know it's hard to believe
but it's true.

764
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,190
I... I own a yacht
and I like pretty girls...

765
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,230
..and er...

766
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,000
Can I be honest? Please.

767
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:05,030
The best thing is those girls don't
expect a thing from me

768
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,200
beyond a good time and a diamond
bracelet as a thank-you note.

769
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,090
And do you like that too?
Nobody gets disappointed.

770
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,080
And I hate to disappoint people.

771
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,170
Is it why you never married?
Oh, what a leading question.

772
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,030
I thought well-born English girls

773
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,210
were supposed to be reticent
and refined.

774
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,220
That was before the war. Ah!

775
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,230
Well, I would find it hard
to respect any woman
who wished to marry me.

776
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:36,210
But plenty of nice women would want
to marry you, Mr Levinson.

777
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,000
You mean, because I'm rich?

778
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,080
You are strange. You invite me here
today as an apology

779
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,060
and yet you seem bent
on offending me again. I hope not.

780
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:52,180
Because I like you very much,
Miss Allsopp.

781
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,060
More than any lady
I have ever known,

782
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:00,040
if I may use the term.

783
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,160
But you won't go along
with Papa's scheme? No.

784
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:09,030
And you wouldn't want me to.
How do you know that?

785
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,120
Because you're better
than your father, Miss Allsopp.

786
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:19,060
Will you warn your mother off him?

787
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:22,110
Oh, my mother can look after
herself, believe me.

788
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,010
Can you really manage? Oh, yes.

789
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,200
You were going to be ten anyway,
now everyone's here,

790
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,100
so 14 makes no difference.

791
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,090
I only hope Mrs Hughes can sort out
the sleeping arrangements.

792
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,040
Mm. We're packed in like sardines
but I suppose it's not for long.

793
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:45,190
Ooh! If the family's sardines,
My Lady, the staff are like maggots.

794
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,080
Erm, where's Bates? He were in
the servants' hall earlier on.

795
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:55,000
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.
My Lady.

796
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,180
His Lordship asked if there's
any news on the note for tonight.

797
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:05,230
It's here, My Lady.

798
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,190
But that's extraordinary. How did
you get him to do it so quickly?

799
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,210
He had nothing else on. It's all
quite proper, whatever it may seem.

800
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,040
As His Lordship assured me.

801
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,110
Good luck with the recovery plan
when you get to Mr Sampson's flat.

802
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,200
We'll let you know.

803
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,210
Well, I'd better tell His Lordship
we're all set.

804
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,140
It's a funny thing about London,
isn't it,

805
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,020
the way it seems to draw one
into peculiar situations?

806
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,090
Like any big city.

807
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,100
I expect many people must regret
things they got up to in London.

808
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:50,000
Is there anything I can do, My Lady?

809
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:56,030
It's only that we've forced
this dinner on Mrs Patmore
without warning.

810
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,200
I was checking to see
if she was on top of it.

811
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:02,000
Mrs Patmore is very resilient.

812
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:08,060
I'm not sure I can leave it alone,
with the ticket.

813
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,080
We're talking about a man's life,
Mrs Hughes.

814
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,030
Whatever we may think,
do we have a right to do nothing?

815
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,070
So Mr Bates must be ruined,
or even hanged,

816
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:23,080
because a vile, vicious monster is
no longer with us?

817
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,130
I'm sorry. What you're asking me
to do is wrong.

818
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,050
Whoever the man,
whatever the motive, it's wrong.

819
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,230
What? A card game? Here?

820
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,240
And what
are the ladies supposed to do?

821
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,160
Put feathers in their hair
and light the gentlemen's cigars?

822
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:48,170
You know, Rosamund wants to take you
to the theatre. Oh, I don't think so.

823
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,230
Oh, no. I'm too tired for an evening
of second-hand emotion.

824
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,220
Oh, me too. One outing's enough.
I'd rather stay in and play cards.

825
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,090
Oh, poker's not your game.

826
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,180
I hope you don't mind playing on
your first night here. Not at all.

827
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:06,020
Then we'll sit and talk
and leave the men to it.

828
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,230
So it doesn't strike you as odd?
No, not really. Well, not very.

829
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,100
And Mary's men, why are they coming?
Don't call them Mary's men.

830
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,170
They're coming for cards, Mama,
except for Charles Blake.

831
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,160
He doesn't play.
That is, he won't play tonight.

832
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,230
We could play a different game.
Oh, no, he has to go out.

833
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,190
He's taking Mary and me to see
a show. Not a very long show.

834
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,240
I wish you'd say what's going on.

835
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:33,190
Well, now, Isis, old girl.
Are you happy to be in London?

836
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,030
She's happy to see you.
I was no substitute.

837
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:43,180
Whoa! Well, the gang's all here,
I see.

838
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:45,120
Is that American for hello?

839
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,100
Harold, I don't believe
you've met Tom, Sybil's husband.

840
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,090
It seems strange we never met
when she was here to introduce us.

841
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,030
Well, I'm glad to know you now.

842
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,150
How curious these phrases are!
Could we get some tea?

843
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
With milk?

844
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:05,120
Well, I hope you enjoyed our picnic.
Of course we did.

845
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,150
Even if the combination of open-air
picnics and after-dinner poker

846
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,000
make me feel as though I've fallen
through a looking-glass

847
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,080
into the Dejeuner Sur L'Herbe.

848
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:17,130
It's lucky you don't exaggerate,
Mama.

849
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:22,230
Poker after dinner?
There's a message from Rosamund
that she's taking us to the theatre.

850
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:26,160
Not us - you. Why have I been
selected for this honour?

851
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,060
She was complaining
she doesn't see enough of you.

852
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:31,090
Enough for what?

853
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:37,240
Well, if I'm going to the theatre,
then I ought to change.

854
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,030
Yes. I should.

855
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,050
Have you heard from Alfred again?
Why would we?

856
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:54,000
Don't suppose he can be bothered
with us now, cooking for film stars
and the crowned heads of Europe.

857
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,200
I'll crown you if you don't get that
back on the heat.

858
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,050
No, but he's escaped, hasn't he?
Escaped from what?

859
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,150
Well, you know - ordinary life.

860
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,210
Oh!

861
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,160
Before you go in, My Lord.
What is it?

862
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,080
I wasn't sure whether to tell you
but I was put in charge of Downton
when you left.

863
00:57:26,090 --> 00:57:28,190
Is something wrong? Not in that way.

864
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,240
And you may think
it's not my business

865
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,210
but when the family's honour is
concerned, My Lord,
it is my business.

866
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:38,070
Go on. The other night
I was patrolling the galleries,

867
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,010
making sure everything was
ship-shape before I turned in,

868
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,060
when I ran into Mr Branson
with a lady.

869
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,190
Upstairs? Just as I said, My Lord.
On the bedroom gallery.

870
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,060
What time was this? Oh, quite late.

871
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:54,200
I can't say which room
they'd been in or if they'd been
in a room at all except...

872
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:57,130
I don't know why else
they'd be up there.

873
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:01,100
Anyway, they went downstairs and
he drove her back to the village.

874
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:05,010
Who was this lady?
He said her name was Miss Bunting,

875
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,160
a Miss Sarah Bunting.

876
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,180
Of course, Mr Branson is still
a young man

877
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:12,160
and he can't be expected to stay
single all his life but even so...

878
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:15,000
Thank you, Barrow.
Yes, My Lord.

879
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,180
Do we have anything I can take up
some ice in? Why do you need ice?

880
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:25,020
Mr Levinson seems to want it
in everything he drinks.

881
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:27,170
Er, I'm glad you're all here.

882
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,050
I have something
I want to tell you.

883
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:34,220
Her Ladyship wants to give us all
a day out while we're in the south.

884
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:36,080
Oh!

885
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,120
I've been thinking
a visit to the Science Museum.

886
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,180
Or perhaps to see where they've put
the Crystal Palace!

887
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,020
Then there's the Royal Institution.

888
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,040
Or the Natural History Museum.

889
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,020
Of course, Westminster Abbey is
always a good day out.

890
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,130
Well, I'm sure we'll come up
with something.

891
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,070
Erm... Could I have that ice?

892
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,160
Mrs Hughes, did you get rid
of that old coat?

893
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:14,150
I did. They were very grateful.
We should tell that to Mr Bates.

894
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,170
I took it without saying and
he hadn't gone through the pockets.

895
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,080
There was nothing in them,
was there?

896
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:24,070
Nothing that matters now.

897
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,160
Well, that's a funny answer.

898
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:29,210
Can I help you, Miss Baxter?
No, no.

899
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,210
I hope Daisy gave you my message.

900
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,070
She did, yes.
So what's going on?

901
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,170
I know you. There's something.

902
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:52,000
Are you free, Miss Baxter? I've a
book I've been meaning to show you.

903
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,020
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

904
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:00,160
What was it you wanted to say?
You must promise
not to answer straightaway.

905
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,220
Not to answer what? Mr Levinson
wants you to come to America

906
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,060
to cook for him.

907
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,000
We'll be touring Europe for a month.
You have plenty of time to decide.

908
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:15,040
Then, if you agree,
he'll send you the fare
and I'll meet you in New York.

909
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:19,020
Are you serious? He says he'll be
teased for hiring an English cook

910
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,070
but he loves your food - he does.

911
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,240
That's not what I were expecting.

912
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:39,180
Terribly out of practice.
Haven't played since Downton.

913
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,110
It's rather sad poor Mr Gregson
won't be joining us.

914
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,010
You've heard about that?
Everyone has.

915
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,100
It's quite a mystery
but I confess to a certain relief

916
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,010
he won't be at the table tonight.

917
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:53,060
Did he give you a difficult time
of it?

918
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,140
To be honest, I wasn't sure he was
playing strictly according to Hoyle

919
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,110
but we'll leave it,
since the poor chap's missing.

920
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,180
I hope we can trust everyone
at the table tonight.

921
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:06,160
I'm disappointed. I was rather hoping
to find Mrs Levinson here.

922
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,190
I'm sure you were.

923
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,110
I gather you've been entertaining
in our absence.

924
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:19,020
Have I? Barrow mentioned a friend of
yours came up for dinner one night.

925
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:23,040
Not for dinner but I brought her
to the house after dinner.

926
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:29,150
After dinner?
She...wanted to have a look.

927
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:35,080
We ought to concentrate or Sampson
will have his way with us.
(CHUCKLING)

928
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,100
This is so kind of you.

929
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:46,240
Sorry to hear that Mr Sampson was
taken ill, miss.

930
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,130
I'm sure it isn't serious but
we do need to gather some things.

931
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:54,080
Let me know when you're done and
I'll come and lock up. Thank you!

932
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,240
It's rather sad to see the truth
behind Mr Sampson's smooth facade.

933
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,200
Cheating at cards can't be
very lucrative after all.
Never mind that.

934
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:14,240
Charles, you take the desk,
and, Mary, we'll search the bedroom.

935
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,040
They say men hide things
in their sock drawer.

936
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,130
Why's that, do you think?
It's a deterrent.

937
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:23,120
What could be more revolting
than rummaging through
a strange man's socks? Ugh!

938
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:27,010
You're very thoughtful, Miss Baxter.

939
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:30,000
Am I?

940
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,100
It's no use ganging up
with Mr Molesley.

941
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,060
He can't protect you like I can.

942
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,140
And he doesn't know what I know,
does he?

943
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,220
He knows how to be kind, Mr Barrow.

944
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,000
He has the advantage of you there.

945
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,210
Erm, mine, I believe. Sorry!

946
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,200
Oh, so you do have the cards!
I must play more!

947
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:55,220
AYSGARTH: You said Sampson would
have the trick of it.

948
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,180
I haven't had a hand all night.

949
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,140
Gentlemen, have we had enough?
Surely not.

950
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:03,130
We've only just begun.
TONY: No. No, I think that's it.

951
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:12,130
I gather we've failed to protect
the Prince from his recklessness?

952
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:16,100
(SIGHS) So now the press
will go to town. I'm afraid so.

953
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:20,150
But I daresay his lack of judgment
would have tripped him up
sooner or later.

954
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,220
Rather gloomy for a monarchist.
I'm a realist monarchist.

955
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:27,100
I think someone's waiting for you.

956
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:34,080
I should be off.
I'm so grateful - really.

957
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:38,120
Well, if it does all blow up, I hope
he finds out how hard we tried.

958
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:41,030
I can't be sad, though. No?

959
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,130
You were in trouble
and you called on me.

960
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:47,170
It seems a very positive step,
which I'd like to see repeated
immediately, if possible.

961
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:52,020
Must I be in trouble again so soon?
I mean it, Mary.

962
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,040
Give me a chance.

963
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:58,110
Are you sure? My lot's going down
and your lot's coming up.

964
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:02,000
Is that a receipt
for a peaceful coexistence?

965
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:05,110
I wouldn't put it like that.
I'd say I believe in the future.

966
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,180
And so could you.

967
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:11,030
I'd better go.

968
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,130
I'll see you at the ball.

969
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:21,000
Mr Bates, Lady Rose is back
and she asked me to tell you

970
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,170
that the note worked

971
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:26,000
but they couldn't find
what they were looking for,
whatever that means.

972
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:31,080
What does it mean?
James, when they leave
I'll need a hand with the coats.

973
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:35,170
I'd like to help, Mr Carson.
Oh, that would be appreciated.

974
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,030
Thank you.

975
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,110
So, from tomorrow,
it's full speed ahead for the ball.

976
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,170
Could we tell them about the outing,
to keep their spirits up?

977
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:49,150
Have you had any further thoughts?
Well, I was wondering if we might
go for something more obvious.

978
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,170
Madame Tussaud's, perhaps.

979
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:56,010
There are interesting
historical figures to be seen there
and not just sensational ones.

980
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:58,100
Are there?

981
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,030
Are you all right, my darling?

982
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,240
I never know what's going on
inside that head of yours,

983
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,020
not these days.

984
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,130
But you do know I would never do
anything to hurt you, don't you?

985
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:16,130
What an extraordinary thing to say!
Extraordinary or not, it's true.

986
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,180
Whatever I may do,
it would never be to hurt you.

987
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,130
Good night, Papa.

988
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:28,040
Do you mean we've all been kept
in the dark for nothing?

989
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:31,040
I'm afraid so.
Kept in the dark about what?

990
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:35,040
Oh, just, some romantic scheme.

991
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:36,150
Nothing more.

992
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:38,240
Might it concern
my old friend Aysgarth,

993
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,090
who came here to see
a certain lady from across the seas?

994
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:46,090
A certain lady destined to go back
across the seas with any luck.

995
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:51,200
Lady Grantham, I'm very touched
by your generosity to me.

996
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,100
I know we English don't speak
of such things

997
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:56,040
but I won't forget it.

998
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,000
That's quite all right.

999
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,050
Good night.
Good night.

1000
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,240
It was nice of you to come tonight,
after our conversation earlier.

1001
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,090
I hope you'll be at the ball.

1002
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:10,170
Why wouldn't I be?

1003
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,240
Good.

1004
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:17,170
I expect you'll have another game
tomorrow. How well you know me.

1005
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:22,020
Thank you. Which is Mr Sampson's?
I have it here. Thank you, Mr
Carson.

1006
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:24,230
Don't you ever get tired of it?
It's a lucrative game.

1007
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,210
Thanks. Did you talk to Mr Levinson?

1008
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,110
There we are, sir.

1009
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:40,030
And there's no chance
of Mrs Levinson...? Good night.

1010
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,090
I'm worn out, I'm worn out.

1011
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:47,220
I feel as if I've spent
the whole evening trapped
in the cast of a whodunit.

1012
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,060
Nobody's done it,
that's the problem.

1013
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,030
Good night, Mama. Good night, dear.

1014
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,230
I beg your pardon, My Lord.

1015
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,240
What's this?

1016
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,050
It occurred to me, My Lord,

1017
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,240
that were I in possession
of a very sensitive document,

1018
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,120
I would not leave it unguarded
in my home

1019
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:10,110
but rather, I would take it with me
wherever I went.

1020
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,000
So I helped a gentleman
on with his coat.

1021
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,050
He left it in his overcoat?
It was in his inside breast pocket

1022
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,050
and now it is safely in your hands.

1023
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,060
I'll see you upstairs, My Lord.

1024
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,180
(GASPS)

1025
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,090
I don't believe it! How?

1026
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:40,240
Mr Sampson appears to have
dropped it and Bates picked it up.

1027
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,060
He dropped it? Aren't we fortunate?

1028

Fortunate is one word for it.

1029
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:24,220
So it was a happy ending, My Lady?
A happy ending for the Prince.

1030
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:27,180
A crisis for the monarchy has been
averted,

1031

but would you tell him
how grateful we are?

1035
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,100
He'll be glad to have been of use,
My Lady.

1036

but you already know that.

Certainly not.

I know that any woman,
no matter who she was,

would be lucky to claim you
as her husband.

You're kind, clever,
and much too modest.

exciting to see the Prince of Wales.

the basement steps when he leaves.

I don't know
what Mr Barrow's got over you

1116
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:12,100
and I don't want to know

1117
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:15,000
but he mustn't make you do things
that aren't right

1118
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:17,080
and you can't let him bully you.

1119
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,100
That's easy to say.
I know.

1120
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:24,120
But if he draws you
into his schemes, that's not going
to be easy for you either.

1121
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:29,100
Sometimes, it's better to, you know,
take a risk

1122
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:32,010
than to go down the wrong path -
that's all.

carry it up to the ballroom myself?

That's why the Prince came
to open the ball.

1127
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,170
I'm glad.

1128
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,050
Is there any progress on whether
it's going to turn out well for me?

Oh, Tony, I wish I knew.

1130
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:03,020

dangling you and Charles and
even Evelyn on the end of a string.

1131
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:08,080
You didn't refuse Charles either?
I tried but he wouldn't have it.

1132
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,010
Are you sure it's not him?

1133

for George

1134

waking minute holding it together.

1135
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,180
Yes. Charles is on the other side
of that struggle.

1136
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,020
He's an outsider who resents
the very people I come from.

1137
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,010
Even if he loves me,
how can we pull as team?

1138
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:38,190
Of course, I should sing and dance
to hear you say that

1139
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:42,140
but you seem to have got
the wrong end of the stick
with Charles.

1140
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:45,210
What do you mean? Charles is
the heir to his father's cousin,

1141
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:47,190
Sir Severus Blake.

1142

He is to inherit the baronetcy on
one of the largest estates in Ulster.

1143

Charles?

1144
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,160
But if that were true,
surely I would have heard of him?

1145
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:01,220
Well, Sir Severus is
a distant relation

1146
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:05,240
and Charles has always played it down
but he is not an outsider.

1147
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:11,180
In fact, he's going to be
a lot more eligible than I am.

1148
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:15,040
Why did no-one tell me this before?
Does it make a difference?

1149
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:19,180
To know that he and I are
on the same side, yes,
of course it makes a difference.

1150
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:22,220
You sound as though

there will be a new life for me,

01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:28,040
I'm going home in the morning, Mama.
You don't mind, do you?

1176
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:30,130
Of course not. Is there a reason?

1177
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,200
Various reasons.

1178
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:34,210
I might go to the Continent.

1179
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:36,240
Not for long. Really?

1180
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,180
Does it have anything
to do with Michael Gregson?

1181
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:43,240
It has everything to do
with Michael Gregson.
Couldn't someone go for you?

1182
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,090
I'm afraid not, Aunt Rosamund.

1183
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm absolutely afraid not.

1184
01:20:55,180 --> 01:20:58,080
Oh! Oh! Off to bed, are we?

1185
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:01,210
Well, that's very sensible.
A woman your age needs her rest.

1186
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:07,140
You need a rest cure if you are
taken in by that booby Aysgarth.

1187
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:10,160
Violet, forgive me,
and I don't mean to be offensive,

1188
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,230
but are you always this stuck-up?

1189
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:15,040
Do tell me, do tell me -

1190
01:21:15,050 --> 01:21:20,080
is the new Lady Aysgarth all set
to hold London enthralled

1191
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,040
with tales of how the West was won?

1192
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:25,100
Well, actually, I turned him down.
Oh!

1193
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:28,030
You surprise me.
Mm-hm. I'm sure.

1194
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:32,070
You see, I have no wish
to be a great lady. No.

1195
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,210
A decision that must be reinforced

1196
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:37,200
whenever you look in the glass.

1197
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:45,030
Violet, I don't mind
looking in the mirror

1198
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,230
because what I see is a woman
who's not afraid of the future.

1199
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:52,110
My world is coming nearer

1200
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,160
and your world, it's slipping
further and further away.

1201
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,130
Good night.

1202
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,160
Hmm.

1203
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,050
Breakfast is done but there are
still quite a few in the ballroom.

1204
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,170
No, go to bed.
Take the others with you.

1205
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:21,040
I'll keep James and give him
the rest of the morning off.

1206
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:25,100
And what about you? It won't be the
first time I've gone without sleep.

1207
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:29,160
We ought to have the outing settled
if we're going on Thursday.

1208
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:33,060
Oh! I feel...

1209
01:22:33,070 --> 01:22:36,000
a little guilty about that.

1210
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:40,230
I tried out my ideas on them and
I couldn't fire up any enthusiasm,

1211
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:45,120
so I wonder if we should just settle
for a day by the sea.

1212
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:49,070
I know it's a defeat
but what do you think?

1213
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,210
We could take the Pullman
from Victoria.

1214
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:54,050
A day-return ticket costs
12 shillings each.

1215
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:57,070
It's a lot
but Her Ladyship's happy to pay.

1216
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:00,200
Well, thank heaven you got there
in the end.

1217
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:11,170
We've danced all night.
Your mother's gone to bed.

1218
01:23:11,180 --> 01:23:14,110
Do congratulate her
on such a triumph. I will.

1219
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:19,030
Charles, why did you never tell me
about your cousin?

1220
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,060
Or the estate in Ulster
or any of it?

1221
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:24,110
I don't know, really.

1222
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,230
At first, I wanted you not to assume
I shared your prejudices

1223
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:30,220
because I came
from a similar background.

1224
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:33,100
And later on? Later on?

1225
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:36,230
Later on, I think I wanted to win you
by myself, alone.

1226
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:42,000
Who told you? Evelyn? Well, I suppose
it could have been anyone.

1227
01:23:42,010 --> 01:23:44,190
Tony Gillingham told me.
Oh.

1228
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,170
I thought it suited him for you
to think of me as an alien being.

1229
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:49,240
I think he wants it to be
a fair fight.

1230
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,010
Always assuming
we're the only two in the ring.

1231
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,050
So now...

1232
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,090
let battle commence?

1233
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,020
Let battle commence.

1234
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,140
Thank you. Just put it there.

1235
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:28,000
So if you go tomorrow, how long
would you be in Switzerland?

1236
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:31,150
Three or four days at the most.
So we've not got long to prepare.

1237
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:34,190
I will pay you for the first month
this afternoon

1238
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,180
but with three children,
you must have most
of the paraphernalia already.

1239
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:41,180
You're right. We won't need much.

1240
01:24:41,190 --> 01:24:44,150
And you're quite sure your wife is
willing to take this on?

1241
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,240
Marjie dotes on children, My Lady.

1242
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:51,120
In fact, I'm not sure
we've had our last.

1243
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:57,240
She'll love it like her own.

1244
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,110
We'll need a decent story.

1245
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:07,060
That the parents are dead
and the mother was a friend of yours
or something

1246
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:09,100
and that's why you've taken her in.

1247
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:14,150
Well, that's true, except of course
it's my friend and not yours.

1248
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,050
But you don't want her here?
I can't have her here.

1249
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,050
My parents disapproved
of my friendship with her mother.

1250
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:26,180
They'd feel uncomfortable
for the baby to be in the house.

1251
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:31,050
I see.

1252
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:33,090
Which is why it has to be a secret.

1253
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:39,100
I hope I can make you understand
how important that is.

1254
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:43,130
I'll pay you whatever you want

1255
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:47,010
but it has to be a complete secret
from my family.

1256
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,220
I tell you what.

1257
01:25:55,180 --> 01:25:58,100
I think it should be our secret,
My Lady.

1258
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,150
Ours and no-one else's.

1259
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,100
I'll er...

1260
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:09,080
send a letter to myself tonight

1261
01:26:09,090 --> 01:26:13,180
and tell Marjie it's about
an old friend of mine who's died

1262
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:17,060
and asked for me to take the child.

1263
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,000
She won't question it.

1264
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:26,040
Then nobody but you and I will know.

1265
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:29,130
Mr Drewe, would you do that for me?

1266
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:31,240
For you and the little girl,
My Lady,

1267
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,110
yes, I will.

1268
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,040
How comforting it is
that there really are

1269
01:26:40,050 --> 01:26:42,130
a few good people left in the world.

1270
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:18,150
I know you're hiding something
from me. I can tell.

1271
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,000
No, I'm not.

1272
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:24,210
Don't make me act harshly,
Miss Baxter, because you know I can.

1273
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:28,140
You must do as you think best,
Mr Barrow,

1274
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:30,030
just as I must.

1275
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:36,210
Oh, whoo!

1276
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:40,140
I have to thank you, Mr Molesley.
Oh? Why's that?

1277
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,220
There are things in my past
that have made me afraid

1278
01:27:45,230 --> 01:27:48,080
but...

1279
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:50,140
I'm not afraid any more.

1280
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:53,110
I'm not sure what will happen
but whatever it is,

1281
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:55,150
it's better than being afraid.

1282
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:01,000
You've made me strong, Mr Molesley.

1283
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:04,180
Your strength has made me strong.

1284
01:28:05,210 --> 01:28:08,000
My what?

1285
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:11,180
What time do you go tomorrow?
The train leaves at ten.

1286
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:14,050
I reckon Spain and Italy may be
pretty hot,

1287
01:28:14,060 --> 01:28:18,030
so when you see me again -
No, no.

1288
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,190
I won't be coming to America.

1289
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,040
Don't make a decision too -
I'm not coming.

1290
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:26,130
But thank you.
And please thank Mr Levinson.

1291
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:31,220
You know why I asked you?
I think I do, yes.

1292
01:28:31,230 --> 01:28:35,030
I didn't say it because I thought
it might frighten you off.

1293
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,160
But we could make a go of it.

1294
01:28:38,170 --> 01:28:43,190
Daisy? I suspect
we want different things, Mr Slade.

1295
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:48,090
But it means that much to me
to hear you say it. Thank you.

1296
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,150
Could I try? Try what?

1297
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:56,150
To cook for Mr Levinson. I know all
the dishes Daisy makes, I promise.

1298
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:59,240
Yes, but it would have worked
with Daisy in New York -

1299
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,120
If Mr Levinson likes her style
of cooking...

1300
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,070
Please. Give me a trial.

1301
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,240
I'll save up and pay my own way out
if I have to.

1302
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,220
Let her come! You've told him
you've got an English cook
and he won't know the difference.

1303
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,200
OK. I'll cable
when I get back to New York

1304
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:20,230
and you won't have to pay
for your ticket.

1305
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:23,050
But I warn you -
he can be quite picky.

1306
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,020
Don't worry. This is my chance.

1307
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:28,040
I swear I won't let you down.

1308
01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:38,170
That were kind of you, Daisy.

1309
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,070
Why shouldn't she go to America
if it's what she wants?

1310
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,240
You're not upset, then,
by Mr Slade making advances?

1311
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,010
Upset?

1312
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:49,200
Mrs Patmore,
if you knew what it feels like

1313
01:29:49,210 --> 01:29:53,080
to have a young man keen
to court me...

1314
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:56,170
I'd kiss him if it wouldn't give him
the wrong idea.

1315
01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:00,120
Upset? I'm that chuffed,
it'll take me through
to next summer.

1316
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:06,140
Did I ever tell you how glad
they were to get that coat
for the Russian refugees?

1317
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:09,100
Poor souls.

1318
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:13,020
I just wish you'd let me go through
the pockets first, that's all.

1319
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:15,240
I'm sorry.

1320
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,150
Is there anything I can do
to make up for it?

1321
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,190
Mmm.

1322
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,170
Let me think.

1323
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,120
You could always buy me a penny lick.

(GASPS)

1325
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:42,230
Come on - I dare you.

1326
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,150
But if get my trousers wet...

1327
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,180
If you get them wet, we'll dry them.

1328
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:51,180
Suppose I fall over?
Suppose a bomb goes off,

1329
01:30:51,190 --> 01:30:54,010
suppose we're hit by a falling star?

1330
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,060
You can hold my hand,
then we'll both go in together.

1331
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:00,180
I think I will hold your hand.

1332
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:03,170
It'll make me feel a bit steadier.

1333
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:06,210
You can always hold my hand
if you need to feel steady.

1334
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,200
I don't know how but you managed
to make that sound a little risque.

1335
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:17,010
And if I did?

1336
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,190
We're getting on, Mr Carson,
you and I.

1337
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,230
We can afford to live a little.

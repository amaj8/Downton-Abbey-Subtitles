1
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,440
I'll have to go.
Of course you must go.

2
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,540
Oh, but who'll give the letter
to her ladyship?

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Oh, I can do that and I'll take
her breakfast and dress her today,

4
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,540
but I haven't got time
to make it a regular thing.

5
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,400
No, I can do it until she finds
someone else. Lady Mary won't mind.

6
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
What's the matter with you?
Miss O'Brien's upped and left!

7
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,460
Never!

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,460
Jimmy!

9
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,460
Jimmy. Miss O'Brien's gone!

10
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,520
What? Gone where?
How should I know?

11
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,320
Madge, O'Brien's gone.

12
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,500
- Have you heard?
- Heard what?

13
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,340
- Miss O'Brien? She's gone.
- What do you mean gone?

14
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,440
She's left.
Left?

15
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,520
She's packed up.

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,500
I can't believe it.

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,540
I can. Sneaking off like a thief
in the night, that's O'Brien to a T.

18
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,400
I just can't believe
Susan has done this to me.

19
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,420
Miss O'Brien did say that she got on
very well with Lady Flintshire

20
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,540
when she was up in Scotland.

21
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,520
So I gather!

22
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,340
"Lady Flintshire has booked
my ticket for India

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,400
"and it seems too good
a chance to miss."

24
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,360
Was there really no warning?

25
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,340
Now I think of it,
she'd a telegram yesterday.

26
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,460
That must have been it.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
So what happens now?

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,540
I'll dress you today, m'lady,

29
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,320
and Anna will take over tomorrow,
until you find a replacement.

30
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,500
And she really gave no clue?

31
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,420
She didn't say anything to me,
Mr Carson, not a word.

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,400
As long as she didn't.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,400
I know you all think she must have
said summat, but she didn't.

34
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,400
I believe you. Thousands wouldn't.

35
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,460
She may be my aunt
but she's a dark horse.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,380
No-one will contradict you there.

37
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,420
Susan Flintshire
has stolen Mama's maid

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,480
whilst her daughter's
a guest in this house?

39
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,460
I'm sure she wouldn't
put it like that.

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,400
I don't care how she puts it.
It's absolutely disgraceful.

41
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,300
It's all right. Madge told me.
It is NOT all right.

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,460
Did you have any idea?
No. Not really.

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,340
I knew, I knew that Mummy thought
O'Brien was very good at doing hair,

44
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,420
and they talked about her
wanting to travel...

45
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,420
What? When?
When you were all at Duneagle.

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,340
And you didn't think to inform us?

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,500
I'm in London tomorrow. I can put
an advertisement in The Lady.

48
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,320
Good.

49
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,500
Won't it take forever, waiting for
the magazine to come out?

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,420
It can't be helped.

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,300
We're meeting Trent at eleven.

52
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
I'll see you there. I want to walk
the plantations first.

53
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,460
I was wondering if Mary
might like to come.

54
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Don't bother Mary.
She's got enough on her plate.

55
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,500
Did you really not know anything?

56
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I never thought
she'd go through with it.

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,460
I thought you might like
to take this down with you.

58
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,380
In case you want a walk.
It's quite chilly.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Where's the black one?

60
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,500
I'm taking Master George out
for some air, m'lady,

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,300
and I wondered if you'd
like to come with us.

62
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,420
I don't think so, but thank you.

63
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,480
Poor little orphan.

64
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,480
Thank you, Nanny.

65
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,340
He's not an orphan.
He's got his mother.

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,500
Orphans haven't.

67
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,340
He isn't poor either, come to that.

68
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,460
And you don't mind
my seeing to her ladyship?

69
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,500
Why would I mind? I'm not planning
a trip round the world.

70
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,460
Mr Molesley. Have you seen Mr Travis?

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,380
I need to speak to him about
the Bring and Buy Sale.

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,340
I'm afraid not, your ladyship.

73
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,320
Never mind.

74
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,420
This were a sad business.

75
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,460
Very, very sad.

76
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,420
I can't believe it's time
for the stone already.

77
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,300
Six months.

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,520
They always leave six months
for the grave to settle.

79
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,340
Tell me has, has your son
found another job, yet?

80
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,420
No, m'lady.

81
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,400
They've let him stay on and he
always tries to make himself useful,

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,400
but it can't go on forever
and anyway, he's lost his wage.

83
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,300
But he's a properly trained valet!
He could even be a butler.

84
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,460
I hope so, m'lady...

85
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,420
..but it's a changing world.

86
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,520
You don't have to tell me.

87
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,400
Hello.

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,300
It'll soon be time for you
to get out and walk, young lady.

89
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,300
Please don't touch the children,
not without my permission.

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,340
What?

91
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,340
They are in my charge
and I cannot be too careful.

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,460
I would remind you that I knew
this young girl's mother,

93
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,300
which you never did.

94
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,340
That doesn't make you her friend.

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,340
As a matter of fact, it does.

96
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,340
Well, I can't stay here
to bandy words.

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,500
Will you ask Mrs Patmore

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,420
to send up the children's luncheon
in half an hour?

99
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,340
Ask her yourself, why don't you?

100
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,500
Was her ladyship very disappointed?

101
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,320
She was, and it'll take quite
a while to find a replacement.

102
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,480
I can't believe Miss O'Brien
would be so thoughtless.

103
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,440
Can't you? I can.

104
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,500
She wants an adventure.
What's wrong with that?

105
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,380
I don't blame her.

106
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,340
Not for wanting to go, but why
run off and leave us in the lurch?

107
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
You're talking like that
so we'll think you didn't know.

108
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,340
That's not kind!

109
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,500
What's the good of a month
of sour looks? Good luck to her.

110
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,420
How was Lady Mary this morning?
The same.

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,380
But, I suppose she must
come out of it eventually.

112
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,500
For Master George's sake,
if for no other reason.

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,420
I hope so. Right now, she prefers
to leave it all to Nanny West.

114
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,340
I couldn't be a nanny.

115
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,380
Why not? Don't you like children?
No, I do.

116
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,460
Being a nanny you're not one of
the family but not one of us either.

117
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,420
What are you talking about?
Being a nanny.

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,340
Daisy was saying she thinks
it must be a lonely life.

119
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,500
I don't know about that.

120
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,460
But if you ask me, that Nanny West
thinks too much of herself.

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,460
Why? What's she done?
She always seems nice to me.

122
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,460
She only tried to give me orders.

123
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,500
You mean she mistook you
for a servant?

124
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,380
But he IS a servant. Don't tell him.
He'll never get over the shock!

125
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,520
Thank you, Mr Marsh.

126
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,400
He was bound
to be disappointed.

127
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,460
You're sure you want to
abandon the whole plan?

128
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,400
We don't have a choice.

129
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,300
We have to find the death duties
on half the estate.

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,300
They'll be merciless.
I know.

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,500
But, I wish we could wait for Mary
to come back into play.

132
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,380
She isn't a player.

133
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,480
She has a life interest in one third
of Matthew's share of Downton,

134
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,500
and a third of his
other possessions,

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,360
but everything else
belongs to little George.

136
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,420
And that's all the law gives her?
He should have made a will.

137
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,420
But, Mary's George's guardian.

138
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,480
Surely that gives her
some sort of say?

139
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,360
It's a moot point.

140
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,420
Since I own the other
half of everything,

141
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,320
isn't it more appropriate for me
to manage the boy's fortunes?

142
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,420
Besides, she's in such
a fragile state,

143
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,420
the last thing I want is for her
to start worrying about money.

144
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,540
Of course. But you don't think...?
You've seen her!

145
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,360
She hardly has the energy
to lift a fork to her mouth.

146
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,520
She loved him very much.

147
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,360
And the price of great love is
great misery when one of you dies.

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,300
I know that.
Of course you do.

149
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm so sorry.

150
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,500
We better get back
or we'll be late for lunch.

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,340
I've placed advertisements,
Mr Carson, you know I have.

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,420
But the answers weren't suitable?
I didn't get any answers.

153
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,540
Well, I did, but when I wrote back,
I heard nothing more.

154
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,460
Well, I don't know what to suggest.

155
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,420
Because, I can't stay here?

156
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,520
Mr Molesley, I should hate us
to appear inhospitable.

157
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,420
But I can't stay here.

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,480
Is it fair on his lordship?
It has been six months.

159
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,460
I suppose I could go to my dad's
until I get something sorted.

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,340
What a good idea.

161
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,420
Servants' lunch is on the table.
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

162
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,420
Oh cheer up, Mr Molesley.
It may never happen.

163
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,360
It already has.

164
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm going into Thirsk after lunch.
Do you want to come?

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,380
I'm walking down to the village
to see how Isobel's getting on.

166
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,420
Remind her it's an open invitation,
if she wants to see her grandson

167
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,460
or feels like company,
she just has to turn up.

168
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,520
I'll tell her.

169
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,360
I might come with you.
I don't think so.

170
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,460
I don't think she's up
to seeing many people.

171
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,380
I only meant into the village.

172
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,460
Edith, are you really going
to London tomorrow?

173
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,300
I have a couple of errands
if you are.

174
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,540
I'm seeing Michael Gregson.
He must have missed you.

175
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,540
He's giving a party to introduce me
to his literary friends.

176
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,480
How exciting. Isn't it, Robert?

177
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,440
I... I was wondering if I might
put a card in your window.

178
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,300
A card, m'lady?
For a job asking for applicants.

179
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,440
And what sort of job might this be?
Why? Does it make a difference?

180
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,400
No, I suppose not.
Thank you.

181
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,480
Erm, how much will that be?
Sixpence should cover it.

182
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,300
You ought to see more of George.

183
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,300
Poor George.

184
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,500
What a burden he is born into.

185
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,340
A baby rich as Croesus
and a mother almost passed over.

186
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,300
That's the law.

187
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,300
It seems so strange.

188
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,320
Matthew was always so meticulous.

189
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:22,520
He thought that death
was many years away.

190
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,400
And so it should have been.

191
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,500
If there's anything I can do to help,
please let me do it.

192
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm grateful.

193
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,520
But you see,
when your only child dies...

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
..then you're not a mother any more.

195
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,480
You're not anything, really.

196
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,480
That's what I'm trying
to get used to.

197
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,440
You're a grandmother.

198
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,400
And I know you're going to be
a wonderful one.

199
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,520
Afternoon post.
Ah, thank you.

200
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,340
Oh, not this again.

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,320
Not what?

202
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,340
Oh...nothing!

203
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,420
Let me know when
the upholsterer arrives.

204
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,340
I want to be there when you
explain the job in hand.

205
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,340
Very well, but I can easily manage.

206
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,540
He needs to grasp the quality
of the tapestry on the chairs,

207
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,360
before he starts
slamming nails into them.

208
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,440
And I couldn't make him see that?

209
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,460
Just closing, love.

210
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,500
I only wanted to know who was
looking for a lady's maid.

211
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,420
There's not too many in Downton
who need a lady's maid.

212
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,380
You mean the Abbey?

213
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,480
Didn't you used to work there?

214
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,520
I did, but I've been
studying since then.

215
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,480
Studying for what?
To become a lady's maid.

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,520
Madge says that Lady Edith
saw Mrs Crawley this afternoon.

217
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,540
How is she?
In a very dark place, I'm afraid.

218
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,500
And no wonder.

219
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,300
For a widowed mother
to lose an only son...

220
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,300
There's no more fit person
to comfort her than you.

221
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,500
I wonder.

222
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,380
If Lady Sybil had been an only child
I believe I'd have died.

223
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,380
No, m'lady.
You would have lived on for the baby.

224
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,460
And so must she.

225
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,300
Thank you so much, Mrs Hughes,
and good night to you.

226
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,460
Good night, m'lady.

227
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,520
M'lord.

228
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,300
Are you all right?

229
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,540
I feel we must settle the question of
who is to manage the baby's property.

230
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I don't want to hurry Mary
before she's ready.

231
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,380
What question? She's George's
mother and his guardian.

232
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,300
Of course she is, but when it comes
to decisions about the estate,

233
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,460
shouldn't it be me?

234
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,300
Why?

235
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,300
Because, together, my grandson and I
own five sixths of Downton.

236
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,500
Mary's share is only for her life.

237
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,360
She couldn't do much with it
even if she wanted to.

238
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,340
The point being that with
the death duties we're facing,

239
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
there are some big decisions ahead.

240
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,480
You want to push Mary out.

241
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,380
I'm not pushing her out.
She was never "in."

242
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,380
Matthew was co-owner
and now his son is.

243
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,520
I worked with Matthew.
I must work for his boy.

244
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,460
Thanks.

245
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,340
A lot of letters for a Tuesday.

246
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,500
How do people have time to write
when the week is just beginning?

247
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
It's Saint Valentine's Day.

248
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,460
Oh, imagine your remembering that
and my forgetting it.

249
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,420
Who would have thought such a thing?

250
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,540
I am not a complete stranger
to romance

251
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,440
if that's what you're implying.

252
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,340
Maybe I am now, but I wasn't always.

253
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,360
Hold on.
I thought these were all bills.

254
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,440
Daisy! This one's for you.

255
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,320
Daisy? Who's that from?
Don't tease her, Mr Barrow.

256
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,340
Who sent you a card?

257
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,340
I don't know. It's not signed.

258
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,500
Nor's mine.
We both must have secret admirers.

259
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Which is no more than we deserve.

260
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,500
That's enough of that, Mr Bates.
We've work to do.

261
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,520
What's that?

262
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,320
Nothing.

263
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Of course. It's Valentine's Day.

264
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:43,400
When are you leaving for London?
I'm catching the ten o'clock.

265
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,540
I ought to pack.

266
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,440
Have a happy time.

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,420
Just down there.

268
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,480
Mr Grigg?

269
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,500
Do I know you?

270
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,340
You wrote to Charlie Carson
at Downton Abbey.

271
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,300
I work with him.

272
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,300
Did he send you?

273
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,300
Not exactly. In a way.

274
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,380
What... What did he say about me?

275
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,340
What does he plan to do?

276
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,340
Mr Carson is very busy.
He wanted me to find out how you are.

277
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,520
Then, I think
he'll come up with a plan.

278
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
I knew it.

279
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,500
He said some harsh things
when we last met,

280
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,380
but, we go back a long way,
Charlie and me.

281
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,340
And whatever's happened,

282
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,380
to theatre folk like us,
that means something.

283
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,360
Yes, I'm sure it does.

284
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,380
Thank you, Madam.
Thank you.

285
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,480
This is very lovely.

286
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,360
Shouldn't you be at the office?
Aunt Rosamund's sending her car.

287
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,340
I've missed you. I haven't stopped
thinking about you for one moment.

288
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,500
Well, I'm here now.

289
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,340
I couldn't be more thrilled
because I've got some news...

290
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,500
Well, not news, more an idea.
Go on.

291
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,340
I've done some research,

292
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,500
and discovered not every country
is the same as England.

293
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,300
You amaze me!

294
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,440
No, I mean there are places where
lunacy is grounds for divorce,

295
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,480
Portugal and Greece
and even Germany.

296
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,420
But, wouldn't you have to live there?

297
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,320
No, no, I'm just finding out
what's involved.

298
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,480
But if I did live in Germany,
would you come with me?

299
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
Oh. Hello, Burns.

300
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,300
This is Burns,
Aunt Rosamund's chauffeur.

301
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,540
Good afternoon, m'lady.

302
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,300
Can I give you a lift?

303
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,380
I'll take a taxi.
It's the opposite direction.

304
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,360
I'll see you tonight.

305
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
Oh. Am I too early?

306
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,340
No. I'm afraid tea
was a little late.

307
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,400
Oh, dear. Can you manage?
Should I give you a hand?

308
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,480
I can manage, thank you, Miss West.

309
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Come to me, darling.

310
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,380
Hello.

311
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,300
Now, here's the little Prince,
m'lady.

312
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,500
See how happy he is to see his
beautiful Mama?

313
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,480
God bless him.

314
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,360
Thank you, Nanny.

315
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,540
You say you have no purpose,

316
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,420
but what about little George?

317
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,380
Surely you're interested in him?

318
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,480
Of course, but I'm not going to
drive Mary mad by interfering.

319
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,480
It's the job of grandmothers
to interfere.

320
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,340
Oh, that's Molesley.

321
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
He asked to see me and I told him
when he could come.

322
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,460
Oh? Well, may I stay?

323
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,380
Or is it a secret assignation?

324
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,380
Oh. I'm very sorry to interrupt
your ladyship.

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,320
What is it, Molesley?

326
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,420
I came to ask if you'd consider
giving me my old job back.

327
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,340
I apologise for forcing myself
on a private conversation.

328
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,380
I will go.

329
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
No please, m'lady.
There's no mystery.

330
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,400
I've lost my job, because,
well, for obvious reasons

331
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,360
and I thought I'd ask here.

332
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,500
The trouble is,
I have no need for a butler.

333
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,440
These days I'm just an old widow
who eats off a tray.

334
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,460
I see.

335
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,520
Just because you're an old widow,
I see no necessity to eat off a tray.

336
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,500
You and I are different.

337
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,300
Yes, that is very true.

338
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm wasting your time.

339
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,320
Should, should we hear
of an opening...

340
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,420
..where would we find you?

341
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm moving to
my father's house, m'lady.

342
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,420
Have you had any more time
to think about what I said?

343
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,340
You mean our living in sin?

344
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,440
We'd only live in sin as you call it,
until the divorce.

345
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,420
Don't you want to be with me?

346
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,300
You know I do. More than anything.

347
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,300
Erm, is there any more gin, sir?
We're running rather low.

348
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,300
Yes, I'll er, I'll have a look.

349
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,340
Oh, my Lord!

350
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,380
This is an honour, your ladyship.
I have a message for your son.

351
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,460
Lady Shackleton is
joining me for luncheon.

352
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,460
I want him to come and help.

353
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,500
But, what about Mr Spratt?

354
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,340
Well, Spratt will be there,
of course,

355
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,380
but Molesley can still
take an active part.

356
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,300
Lady Shackleton tells me
her butler is retiring.

357
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,420
Won't she have made arrangements
to find another?

358
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,300
But that is the point.

359
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,300
She hasn't yet decided
whether to replace him or not,

360
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,340
so if Molesley can
demonstrate his skills...

361
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,340
Mr Spratt won't mind?

362
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,420
It is not his business to mind.

363
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,380
No. Well...

364
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,320
Very good, m'lady.
Thank you very much.

365
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,380
You took a letter out
of my waste paper basket

366
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,520
when I had clearly crumpled it
and thrown it away?

367
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,460
I could see it had upset you.
I wanted to know why.

368
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,300
I'm sure.

369
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,420
But it didn't occur to you it might
not be your concern WHY I was upset?

370
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,380
Well, anyway, I did it and I read it
and I went to see him!

371
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,400
Don't you want to know how he is?

372
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,460
If I wanted to know how he is,
I would have answered his letter.

373
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,420
Mr Carson, he's in the workhouse!

374
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,380
And in case you're wondering,

375
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,460
it's as bad as if we were reading
about it in a novel by Dickens.

376
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,460
Haven't they closed the workhouses?

377
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,440
No. They haven't. Not all of them.

378
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,420
Well, at least he's in the dry.

379
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,300
If you can call it dry when there's
mould in the very air you breathe.

380
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,500
This is a man
you sang and danced with.

381
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,340
Do you feel nothing?

382
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,340
I don't feel I could be helpful, no.

383
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,460
And I would thank you
not to remind me

384
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,520
of a time in my life
I prefer to forget.

385
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,500
But why would we need it?

386
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,380
It's a mixer. It beats eggs
and whips cream and all sorts.

387
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,520
But you and Ivy do that!

388
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,320
And we'd be glad not to,
thank you very much.

389
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,400
Did Lady Edith say why she got it?
Her ladyship asked her to.

390
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,380
She wants to save us a bit of
elbow grease. You don't understand!

391
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,540
Before too long,

392
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,400
her ladyship could run the kitchen
with a woman from the village.

393
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,300
What with these toasters and mixers
and such like, we'd be out of a job.

394
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,400
I want to try it.
Then on your own head be it!

395
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,340
Did you like your card, Ivy?
What's it to you?

396
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,480
That'd be telling.

397
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Don't listen. He's just teasing.

398
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,500
Come on. Clear out, you two.
There's work to be done.

399
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,420
Do you think that means
that Jimmy sent it?

400
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,460
Maybe he thinks it fun to tease.

401
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,380
But, don't you see?

402
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,380
If Jimmy sent mine,
then who sent yours?

403
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,440
Thomas?
Mr Barrow to you.

404
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,380
Can you tell Mrs Patmore

405
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,340
I won't want the scrambled egg
for Miss Sybbie's tea.

406
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,380
If you go through here and down the
stairs, you can tell her yourself.

407
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,340
Do it. Please. I can't stop.
The children are on their own.

408
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,320
Why did I struggle across London
if Rose was going to sort it out?

409
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,500
You had other things to do.

410
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,340
It doesn't explain why Rose put
the card in the Post Office window.

411
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,500
I just thought how much quicker

412
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,340
it would be if we could
find someone local.

413
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,500
I do feel responsible.

414
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,340
Have you had any answers yet?

415
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,300
We've had three and one's promising,
so we'll see her in Ripon on Friday.

416
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,340
Why isn't she coming here?

417
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,440
She's looking after her aunt,
she can't get away.

418
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,520
It's time for you
to come back to us.

419
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,480
What would you suggest?

420
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,380
Take an interest in something,
doesn't matter what.

421
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Poetry...or carpentry.

422
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,480
History or hats.
I'm interested in George.

423
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
Are you?

424
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,480
I will be.

425
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,360
What have you been doing today?

426
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,460
Well, it's this whole business
with the repair shop.

427
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,500
Tom, don't bore her
with all that nonsense.

428
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,360
It's my fault. I asked.
Even so.

429
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,380
You concentrate on feeling better.

430
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,360
You mustn't worry about
anything else.

431
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,440
Did you send a Valentine's card?

432
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,500
Suppose I did.

433
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,300
Was it to Ivy?
That's my business.

434
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,420
You didn't really
send Ivy a card?

435
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,300
Is it likely?

436
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,300
I sent one to Lady Anstruther.

437
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,420
I worked for her and
she's coming back from France.

438
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,300
She might be useful.

439
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,480
Wasn't that a bit forward?
Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

440
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,500
To be honest, Mrs Hughes,

441
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,340
I don't see that
it's any of my business.

442
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,360
That's something I never thought
I'd hear you say, ma'am.

443
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,320
A wretched man is in the workhouse
and he reaches out to us for rescue.

444
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,340
Well, he reached out to Carson.
I don't see what you want me to do.

445
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,380
Mrs Crawley, I...

446
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,420
I wondered
if I could bring him here.

447
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,300
Here?

448
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,360
If you and I were to vouch for him
to the authorities,

449
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,460
I'm sure we could get him
away from that place.

450
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,380
But why here? Why not the Abbey?
Isn't he Carson's responsibility?

451
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:57,420
I'm sorry to say it, but, Mr Carson
has turned his back on his old pal.

452
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,420
I see.

453
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,540
So you want to risk Carson's wrath
by rescuing this Mr Grigg?

454
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,460
He's a pitiful being,
but he's not beyond work.

455
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,460
He's not beyond a decent life,
if he could find it.

456
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,460
You see, in my present state,
I don't think I'm strong enough...

457
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,300
But you are, ma'am!

458
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,360
If you could just
set aside your grief,

459
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,320
and use that strength
for another's good.

460
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,400
Mr Branson.
Mr Carson.

461
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,400
I know you won't think it correct,

462
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,480
but I need to ask your help
in a difficult situation.

463
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,460
My help, sir?
Lord Grantham is against me in this.

464
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,520
With Matthew gone,
I've no-one else to turn to.

465
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,500
Mary, that is, Lady Mary,
is not improving.

466
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,320
She's suffered a terrible tragedy.
Of course.

467
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,500
But it's six months now,

468
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,380
and she's no better than she was
a week after he died.

469
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,420
The only way is for her to find
an interest outside of herself,

470
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,380
and I know that should be
in the running of the estate.

471
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,440
What does his lordship think?

472
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,500
Lord Grantham thinks his duty
is to protect Mary and her son

473
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,440
by managing everything himself.

474
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,300
And he won't listen to you
on the subject?

475
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,340
He sees her as a little woman,

476
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,360
who shouldn't be troubled by
anything so harsh as reality.

477
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,460
And even were I to agree with you...

478
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,360
..how could I help?

479
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Give her advice.
She'd take it from you.

480
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,520
What makes you say that?

481
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,340
Because she knows you only
want the best for her.

482
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,380
I'm going down to the pub tonight.
When?

483
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,500
After our supper. I'm bored.
I want to stretch my legs.

484
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,360
You can't. It's not your day off.

485
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,520
I can go for a walk, can't I?

486
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,500
- I could never do that.
- Don't be so soft.

487
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,480
I couldn't. I'd keep thinking
I were going to be electrocuted.

488
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,300
You should have more faith.
More courage!

489
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,540
How about some Dutch courage, Ivy?
Why not come with me, tonight?

490
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,380
What? Me go to a pub?

491
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,460
Without leave? You must be mad.

492
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,300
Don't you ever want to
take a chance in life?

493
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,360
When would we be back?

494
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,340
You're not thinking of going?!
I don't know.

495
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,340
I never do anything
I'm not supposed to.

496
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,500
What are you not supposed to do?
Nothing.

497
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,300
What's going on there?
I'm making the mousse for tonight.

498
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,420
Oh, my God. Well, we'd better have
some soup put by.

499
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
I'd rather not rely on
that contraption.

500
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,400
Can I help you?
I doubt you would if you could.

501
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,500
I'm sorry?

502
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,380
Why didn't you give my instructions
to Mrs Patmore about the eggs?

503
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,360
Because I didn't feel like it.

504
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,440
Besides, why can't Miss Sybbie
have an egg to her tea?

505
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,460
I don't have to explain
my decisions to you.

506
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,300
You're a member of staff,

507
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,300
and the orders I give
are to be obeyed.

508
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,520
And aren't you a member of staff?

509
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,520
Not in that way.

510
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,400
Now, I believe I'm needed upstairs.

511
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,300
May I come in?

512
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,460
Carson?

513
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,360
Of course.

514
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,420
I'll leave you now, m'lady.

515
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,420
What can I do for you?

516
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,460
Well, I'm not sure how to start,

517
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,520
but before I do,

518
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,340
you must know that I would only
be as bold as this

519
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
if I felt it was for your benefit.

520
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,400
Now you're frightening me.

521
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,480
Your ladyship...

522
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,300
Do you have a moment?
What is it, Barrow?

523
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,480
There's something's worrying me,
m'lady and I...

524
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,480
I can't hold it in any more.
Why? What's happened?

525
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,460
It's Nanny West.

526
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,380
It seems she's been leaving
the children to their own devices.

527
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,520
What? You mean she's
neglecting them?

528
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,400
I wouldn't have spoken up
if it weren't for a...

529
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:33,320
..a little girl and a baby boy
being put at risk.

530
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,380
Carson, this is my fault.
My lady?

531
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,420
I'm afraid I may have
encouraged you to feel

532
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,460
you have the right
to address me in this way.

533
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,320
His lordship has made a decision

534
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,420
and I find it hard that his butler
should criticise him for it.

535
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,300
No, I never meant...

536
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,440
You do not seem to understand

537
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,340
the effect Mr Crawley's death
has had on me.

538
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,300
As for managing the estate,
I wouldn't know where to start.

539
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,500
But Mr Branson believes you could be
very helpful, my lady,

540
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,500
and as the agent, he should know.

541
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,340
He's just nervous that his lordship
will retreat to his old ways

542
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,420
and abandon all
Mr Matthew's reforms.

543
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,380
And will he?
If he did, wouldn't you approve?

544
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,500
Anyway, whether you approve or not,

545
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm sorry you feel entitled
to overstep the mark.

546
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,400
My lady?

547
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,500
We're old friends,

548
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,440
and as I said, I'm sure this lapse
is as much my fault as yours.

549
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,460
But, I suggest we don't
mention it again.

550
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,360
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's time to go down.

551
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,340
You're letting yourself be defeated,
my lady.

552
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,500
I'm sorry if it's
a "lapse" to say so,

553
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,320
but someone has to.

554
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,340
How is the luncheon
for the tenant farmers coming along?

555
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,460
Well, I think. Tom?

556
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,500
They've all accepted except
for Barnes at Wheelers Wood.

557
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,340
He's sworn to his sister's wedding.
I think we can forgive him.

558
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,460
I have a feeling I've double booked.
It's this Saturday, isn't it?

559
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,460
Don't worry.
We're not having the wives.

560
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,540
Edith can preside.

561
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,480
I can't I'm afraid.
I'm going up to London.

562
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,420
Mary, then.
Me?

563
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,520
Well, if George is owner
of half the estate now,

564
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,420
shouldn't you represent him?

565
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Well, I...
I don't want to bother Mary.

566
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,500
They'd like to see you.
I'm sure they would but...

567
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,360
After all, you'll have to run it
if anything happens to Robert.

568
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,420
Until George is of age, or longer.

569
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,300
For heaven's sake! Why does everyone
keep nagging and nagging?

570
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,460
My husband is dead!
Can't you understand what that means?

571
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,480
After all he suffered in the war,
he's killed in a stupid car crash!

572
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,300
Matthew is dead,
50 years before his time!

573
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,520
Isn't that enough
for me to deal with?

574
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,480
Just leave me alone!

575
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Exactly what I was afraid of.

576
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,540
She is living a nightmare.

577
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,480
We must all step back and allow her
to come through it in her own time.

578
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,400
Aren't I right, Mama?
No. We can't discuss it now.

579
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,420
This mousse is delicious, Carson,
is it the work of Mrs Patmore?

580
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,380
I suppose she hasn't bought it in?

581
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,380
I don't think so, your ladyship, no.

582
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
Then you must be sure
to send her our compliments.

583
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,920
What's the matter, lad?
Are you not feeling well?

584
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
No, it's not that.

585
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,860
Oh, I don't know, Dad. It's just...

586
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,880
It's just lately I...

587
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,820
I can't seem to see
where I'm going, I'm...

588
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,020
You've had a shock, and no wonder.

589
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,800
You should have been working for
Mr Matthew until you were old,

590
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,960
maybe been butler at the Abbey
before you were done.

591
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,980
Now all that's gone,
and your wages with it.

592
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,820
He were a nice chap, Dad.

593
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,920
You know, whatever
the difference between us,

594
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,900
he were always polite, always kind.

595
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
I'm glad to hear it.

596
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,960
But, it's raised my standards,
do you see?

597
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,000
I mean, who is this old...bat

598
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,800
her ladyship wants me
to meet on Friday?

599
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,000
Now, listen.

600
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,880
In your game, if you want the best,
you've got to BE the best.

601
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,980
And work at it!

602
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,820
Get yourself back into service,
in a good post...

603
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,820
..and you'll soon find your way
to where you'd like to be.

604
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,900
I'm leaving.

605
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,800
I didn't want to run off
without saying good night.

606
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,880
I suppose you think I behaved
very badly down there.

607
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,900
My dear, I'm not really
very interested

608
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,020
in whether you behaved badly or well.

609
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,900
No?
No.

610
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,020
I am not your governess.
I'm your grandmother.

611
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,940
And the difference is?
The difference is...

612
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,980
I love you.

613
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,800
Of course you do.

614
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,960
I'm sorry.

615
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,840
Mary, you've gone through
a hideous time.

616
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:10,000
But now you must remember your son.

617
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,900
He needs you...very much.

618
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,860
I know.

619
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,980
The truth is, I don't think
I'm going to be a very good mother.

620
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,800
Why not?

621
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,980
Because somehow,
with Matthew's death,

622
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,840
all the softness that he found in me

623
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:31,820
seems to have dried up
and drained away.

624
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,920
Maybe it was only ever there
in his imagination.

625
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,900
Now, my dear...

626
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,820
..there's more than
one type of good mother.

627
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,980
The fact is,

628
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,980
you have a straightforward choice
before you.

629
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,920
You must choose...

630
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,020
..either death...or life.

631
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,980
And you think I should choose life?

632
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:19,040
Charlie Grigg is going
to stay with Mrs Crawley?

633
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,960
The authorities have released him
into her charge.

634
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,880
I'm collecting him on Friday.

635
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,800
But why has she agreed to this?

636
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,000
Because she is a kind woman,
and he is a man in need.

637
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,880
I cannot believe you are imposing
on Mrs Crawley at a time like this,

638
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,820
when she is almost broken by grief.

639
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,820
It's BECAUSE of her grief
I am imposing.

640
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,980
I don't understand you.
No.

641
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,820
You wouldn't.

642
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,880
You must forgive Mary.

643
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:52,960
I do forgive her.

644
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,000
She is broken and bruised
and it is our job

645
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,860
to wrap her up and keep her
safe from the world.

646
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,900
No, Robert.

647
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,840
It is our job to bring her
back to the world.

648
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm afraid that is not how I see it.
Really?

649
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:11,920
Then I can only say that while I will
overlook Mary's poor judgement,

650
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,900
I find it hard to overlook yours.

651
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,820
Goodnight.

652
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,800
Oh, Edith, Edith,
come to luncheon on Friday.

653
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,940
I...
I mean it.

654
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,840
I need your help
to make things a success.

655
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,040
Why? What are we doing?

656
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,880
We are selling Molesley
to Lady Shackleton.

657
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,840
You mean as a servant?

658
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,040
No. As a Chinese laundryman!

659
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,880
Thank God you're alone.
You've got to help me.

660
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,860
What's the matter with you two?

661
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,840
I don't know, but I'd better
go with him if I want to find out.

662
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,000
Oh, my Lord, what have you done?
She got a bit tiddly down the pub.

663
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,000
She's not tiddly. She's drunk!
He kept buying them.

664
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,880
What were you trying to do?
Nothing.

665
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,880
She's just not used to it.

666
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,980
Come on.

667
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,000
What on earth?!
Ivy's not very well.

668
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,980
That's the understatement
of the year. Bring her inside.

669
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:30,840
Has Mrs Patmore gone to bed?
She must have, thank goodness.

670
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,020
What were you trying to do?
I wasn't trying to do anything.

671
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,980
As long as you weren't.

672
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,860
Here.

673
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,020
How are you feeling?
A bit better, thank you.

674
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,900
You could have done real damage.

675
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,960
You come along with me now.
What about Mr Bates?

676
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:52,800
Won't he be missing you?

677
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,800
Mr Bates must wait his turn.

678
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,860
Meant no harm, Ivy, honest.

679
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,980
You won't say anything about this,
will you?

680
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,820
'Course not.

681
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,900
Come on.

682
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,920
It wasn't deliberate, you know.

683
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,900
I know you only pretend
to like her to tease me.

684
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,000
Why don't you tell her
you didn't send that card?

685
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,860
Oh good morning, Mrs Crawley.
I didn't know you were here.

686
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,920
Alfred let me in.

687
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,860
I wanted to see Master George,

688
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,880
but I'm afraid...Nanny West
didn't think it a good time.

689
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,960
Oh, er, Mrs Crawley...

690
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:39,840
I understand you are offering shelter
to Mr Grigg.

691
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,820
Yes. He's arriving this afternoon.

692
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,860
Only I should hate to feel
you were doing this

693
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,840
out of consideration for me.

694
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,860
Mr Grigg is perfectly capable
of managing his own affairs.

695
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,840
Not very successfully
if he ends up in a workhouse.

696
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,960
I just don't want you to waste
your energy and kindness

697
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:57,800
on an unworthy recipient.

698
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,880
Not at such a time.

699
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,940
I understand.

700
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,880
But you see, Carson,

701
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,860
I'd almost forgotten I had either
energy or kindness in me.

702
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,020
So that's something, isn't it?

703
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,800
Why is she seeing her in Ripon?
I don't know.

704
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,920
Her ladyship won't wait for
the advertisement?

705
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:25,820
She will if this one's no good,
but she wants to get on with it.

706
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,880
How are you, Ivy?

707
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,880
Not wonderful.

708
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,840
I suppose we were all young once.

709
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,980
Yes, but you stayed young.

710
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
That's the difference.

711
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,840
Forgive me, Miss Braithwaite,

712
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:51,000
but I have the strangest feeling
I've seen you before.

713
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,960
Well, yes.
I was just coming to that.

714
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,880
You see, I worked at Downton Abbey,
but only for a short time.

715
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,960
Why was that?

716
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,900
I was a housemaid then, m'lady,

717
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:03,020
and I was starting to feel
it was time to move on.

718
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,800
I see.

719
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,880
So, I took a course in hairdressing,
and I could always sew.

720
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,920
And you got a job as a lady's maid.

721
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,840
I did, m'lady, but it only
lasted for a few months

722
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,920
because the old lady
I was working for died.

723
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,840
I am sorry.

724
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,920
I know I don't sound
very experienced, m'lady,

725
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,940
but I'm a very hard worker and
I've practised what I've learned.

726
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,880
Well, I shall obviously
have to talk to Mrs Hughes

727
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,840
if you've worked for us before.

728
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,820
She gave me a wonderful reference.

729
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,920
When I left.

730
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,900
That does seem very encouraging.
Please say yes, Cousin Cora.

731
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,800
You definitely want the position?

732
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,920
Oh, I do, m'lady.
I enjoyed Downton ever so much.

733
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:49,900
It was just that the work wasn't
sufficiently demanding.

734
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,820
When would you be able to start?

735
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,800
Whenever you want me, your ladyship.

736
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,860
You can make arrangements
for your aunt? My aunt?

737
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,840
I thought that was why you couldn't
come to Downton for the interview.

738
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,840
I'm sorry. Of course it was.
I'm quite dizzy I've got the job.

739
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,040
Erm, yes,
I can make arrangements for my aunt.

740
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,040
Don't worry about that.
It's settled, then.

741
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I'm perfectly capable
of serving luncheon to three ladies.

742
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,000
So, why are you here?

743
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,860
I've an idea that she wants to
introduce me to Lady Shackleton.

744
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,960
Are you sure this isn't your idea?

745
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,960
I wonder if you haven't pushed
her ladyship into it,

746
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,880
so you could just show off
in front of her.

747
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,840
Certainly not!

748
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,800
I think it's my job you're after!

749
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,840
Nothing to do with Lady Shackleton.
No!

750
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:47,840
So you say.

751
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,800
Well, I'm going to announce luncheon.

752
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,960
But I'm warning you. That's all.

753
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,000
My son tells me that this decision
to remove the farm subsidies

754
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,960
has dealt a terrible blow to landed
estates up and down the country.

755
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,980
That awful Mr Lloyd George.

756
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,900
I agree.

757
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,940
You know, I sometimes wonder
if he isn't really German,

758
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,960
just pretending to be Welsh.

759
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,940
It's nice to see you here, Molesley.

760
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,980
Molesley's always been a great
supporter of the family.

761
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,060
That's good to hear.

762
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,080
Oh, yes, Granny and I
are always saying

763
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,940
there's no-one more
reliable than Molesley.

764
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,980
No-one.

765
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,120
Careful, Mr Molesley!

766
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh? Are you quite well, Molesley?

767
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:48,940
Yes, your ladyship.

768
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,060
Oh.

769
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,080
What are you doing
in London, Edith dear?

770
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,000
Oh you know, seeing people.

771
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,980
There's no need to shout!
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

772
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,100
It looked to me as if you were
about to drop it.

773
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,900
Well, I wasn't.
Very well.

774
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,040
Here, take this.

775
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,100
Molesley?

776
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,980
I'm sorry, m'lady.

777
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,060
I didn't realise
the plate was so hot.

778
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,060
Poor man. He seems quite new
to this kind of work.

779
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,940
Does he?

780
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,140
Oh, but that is, no dear no,
that is Molesley's strength.

781
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,940
You see he is always
ready for a challenge.

782
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,120
I think it was very kind of you
to allow him to have a go at it.

783
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,080
Yes well, we, we try to do our best.

784
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,980
I do find it very hard these days
to see how many men

785
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,900
are forced to take employment
for which they are quite unsuited.

786
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,040
I hope you'll soon get back to
whatever it is you're trained for.

787
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,100
Come in, Mr Grigg.
Mrs Hughes has told me all about you.

788
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,940
Thank you, Mrs Crawley.

789
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,980
I was er... I was wondering
if Charlie might be here.

790
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,900
Charlie Carson.
No. Mr Carson's very busy.

791
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,140
But, I'll tell him
that you've arrived safely.

792
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,100
But, he does know I'm coming here?

793
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,100
We talked of it yesterday.

794
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,060
Now, I've run a bath

795
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,020
and dug out some clean clothes
from the missionary barrel.

796
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,020
They should fit you, at least until
we can find something better.

797
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,020
You're very kind.
Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

798
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,040
While I'm sorting him out, I wondered
if you'd look in at the kitchen

799
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,900
and tell Mrs Field he's arrived
and to put his luncheon on a tray.

800
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,060
I think he should stay in bed today
and then we can see where we are.

801
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,060
He's right. You're very kind.

802
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,060
No, no. We must all do what we can.

803
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,980
Hello.

804
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,900
You look...very glamorous.

805
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,020
I thought I'd make
a bit of an effort.

806
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,020
I'm glad you did.

807
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,080
I've ordered some wine for us.

808
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,000
Heavens, how spoiling.

809
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,920
I love the Criterion.

810
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,140
It feels so wild.

811
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,060
To be out with a man, drinking and
dining in a smart London restaurant.

812
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,060
Can you imagine being allowed
to do anything of the sort

813
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,020
five years ago, never mind ten?

814
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,060
The war changed everything.

815
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,060
Mama used to say we could
never eat anywhere public,

816
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,100
except an hotel we were staying in.

817
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,060
She might cheat and take us to
the Ritz, but that was about it.

818
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,920
I do love you so.

819
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,940
Do you?

820
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,920
I'm glad.

821
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,040
Is that what we're celebrating?
That, and my progress.

822
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,080
I've found out I can
divorce Lizzie in Germany,

823
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,020
if I become a German citizen.

824
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,080
You're willing to become
a German citizen, for me?

825
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,960
You'd do that?

826
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,100
I'd become an Eskimo
if it meant I could marry you.

827
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,000
But...Germany?

828
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,020
After four years of fighting,

829
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,040
you'd join the most hated race
in Europe for me?

830
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,060
Can I kiss you?

831
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:17,020
What, here?

832
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,120
In front of all these people?
I don't care.

833
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,120
Kiss me. Now.

834
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,100
Edna Braithwaite is coming back?

835
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,140
I would have talked it over
with you first but...

836
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,980
When I saw that wonderful
reference you wrote her.

837
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,040
Yes, but that was because...

838
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,080
I wrote her a good reference because
I thought she was a good worker,

839
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,080
but I don't see her as a lady's maid.

840
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,040
Couldn't you wait for the replies
to the advertisement, m'lady,

841
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:00,060
before coming to a decision?

842
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,080
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

843
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,980
Do you want to prevent my giving a
hard-working woman a helping hand?

844
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,100
You know, it WAS Jimmy
sent that card to Ivy.

845
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,960
You don't know that.

846
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:27,140
I think I do.

847
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,000
But, if it were him,
then Alfie must have sent mine.

848
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,980
Alfred. Come with me.

849
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,920
Why?
Never you mind. Just come along.

850
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,060
Mr Molesley? Can I get you anything?

851
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,900
A cup of tea?
No. I don't want to be a bother.

852
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,060
How was the famous luncheon?
Lady Edith told me all about it.

853
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,120
Was that before or after?

854
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
Before.

855
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,040
Right. Let's just leave it at that,
shall we?

856
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,060
Mrs Hughes was looking for me.

857
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,000
I saw her go into her sitting room.
Shall I fetch her?

858
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,020
No need.

859
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,040
I'm sorry not to have mentioned it.

860
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,120
I sent the card to Ivy.

861
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,900
But...Jimmy said...

862
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,980
He didn't send one.

863
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,040
Or, if he did,
it wasn't to anyone at Downton.

864
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,000
Good night, Mrs Patmore.

865
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,040
If it weren't him,
then who did send my card?

866
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,100
I won't sleep now.

867
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,000
Oh, for heaven's sake! I sent it.

868
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,980
You?!
Yes.

869
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:49,020
I thought Alfred
would buy one for Ivy,

870
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,080
and I didn't want you to
have nothing to open if he did.

871
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,940
I'm sorry if I did wrong.

872
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,040
No, don't be sorry.

873
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,140
I may not have a follower,
but at least I've got a friend.

874
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,000
Goodnight, Mrs Patmore.

875
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,100
I didn't know what else to say.
I had written her a good reference.

876
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,000
Only because I asked you to.

877
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:21,060
And was I to tell her that,
Mr Branson, and why you asked me?

878
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,040
It's up to me to tell her.

879
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:25,020
I'm the one who got us
into this fix.

880
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,940
No.

881
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,900
Her ladyship has lost a daughter
and a son-in-law.

882
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,020
I cannot now let her think that
Lady Sybil's husband was unworthy.

883
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,060
It's too much.

884
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,140
Then what are we to do?

885
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,100
We can't have her here.
We must.

886
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,060
We'll let her come back and we'll
make sure that she behaves herself.

887
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,020
And if she doesn't?

888
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,100
We must keep a firm eye on her,

889
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:53,120
and I hope we may rely on you to see
that Edna doesn't step out of line.

890
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,060
Of course.

891
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,980
After all, she does appear to have
acquired some proper training.

892
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I don't think that's a lie.

893
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,140
Maybe she's moved
into the real world.

894
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,080
Well, it all sounds like
a ticking bomb to me.

895
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,060
There, there, my precious boy,

896
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:35,000
and don't let that chauffeur's
daughter disturb you any more.

897
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,060
Go back to sleep,

898
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,940
you wicked little cross-breed.

899
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,060
Your ladyship...
I didn't see you there.

900
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,900
Obviously not.

901
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,100
I was just er...

902
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,040
I was just having a game
with Miss Sybbie.

903
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,920
I want you to pack tonight and
leave first thing in the morning.

904
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,040
But, your ladyship...

905
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,940
Please put Master George
back into his crib.

906
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,120
You are not to touch
the children again.

907
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,100
Oh. I thought it was
Nanny West ringing.

908
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,140
No, Mrs Hughes, Nanny West
is leaving in the morning.

909
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,920
Can you find her a bed for the night

910
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,100
and ask one of the maids
to sleep with the children?

911
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:21,900
But, your ladyship,
I was only joking.

912
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,060
I prefer not to discuss it,

913
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,960
except to say that your values
have no place in a civilised home!

914
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,140
Now, Mrs Hughes...

915
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,900
I'll wait here
while Nanny West packs.

916
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:37,900
You will fetch a maid
and prepare a room.

917
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,060
You understand, Miss West is not to
be left alone with the children.

918
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,140
Not for one minute.

919
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,000
I wonder how Edith's getting on.
She has quite a London life.

920
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,080
She's seeing that publisher.
Is it serious?

921
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,060
Well, he's not bad looking
and he's still alive,

922
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:59,980
which puts him two points ahead
of most men of our generation.

923
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,980
Which doesn't alter the fact
she could do a great deal better.

924
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,040
Do you know anything about him?
Not really.

925
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,920
He talked to Matthew a bit
when we were at Duneagle...

926
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,020
Go to bed.

927
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,120
You look done in.

928
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,040
Do you want me at the tenants'
luncheon tomorrow?

929
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,080
No, there's no reason for you to be.

930
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:36,980
I know you're trying to shield me...
Let me manage things in my own way.

931
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,080
Please. It'll be for the best.

932
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:45,000
I have ideas, you know.
Matthew and I used to talk...

933
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,960
My dear, I know I'm right in this.

934
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,000
Now, go to bed.

935
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,060
My lady?

936
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,980
I'm sorry to bother you so late,

937
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,900
but I think you know why I've come.

938
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,060
To apologise.
You have nothing to apologise for.

939
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,040
I pushed into your room
and I spoke impertinently.

940
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:32,020
I suppose you know my grandmother
agrees with you.

941
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,080
That doesn't surprise me.

942
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,980
So, does this mean you've decided to
return to the land of the living?

943
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,980
Because, if so, I'm glad.

944
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,040
It means that I know that I've spent
too long in the land of the dead.

945
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:55,140
We were very fond of Mr Crawley,
you know, my lady.

946
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,120
All of us.

947
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,980
I...

948
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,960
You cry, m'lady.

949
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,960
You have a good cry.

950
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:29,920
That's what's needed now.

951
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,960
And when you're ready...

952
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:37,100
..you can get to work.

953
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,040
Because you are strong enough.

954
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,900
You're strong enough for the task.

955
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,020
But am I, Carson?

956
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,060
That's the point.
Papa doesn't seem to think so.

957
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,920
Don't you owe it to Mr Crawley,
to protect his work?

958
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,040
To fight for the changes he made?

959
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,060
To steer Downton
in the right direction?

960
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,060
I know I can always count on you

961
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,120
for a draught of self-confidence
whenever I start to doubt.

962
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,920
And you will always find one here.

963
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,000
Good night, Carson.

964
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,960
Good night, m'lady.

965
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh my gosh.

966
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,100
What in God's name...?

967
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:45,060
I must have put those
ruddy prongs in wrong.

968
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,980
You did something wrong.

969
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,940
What a day this has
turned out to be.

970
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,060
Why?

971
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,100
Nanny West has been sacked.

972
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,100
So, that's fun for tomorrow.

973
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,900
Well, I'll get the sack
if anyone sees this!

974
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,120
Let Daisy and Ivy clean it up
in the morning.

975
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,080
But Daisy mustn't find out
I don't know how to work it.

976
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,120
Why ever not?

977
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,100
Because it makes her
part of the future

978
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:09,980
and leaves me stuck in the past,
don't you see?

979
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:16,100
Oh... Fetch me an apron.
We'll do it together.

980
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,060
Would you, really?
Why not?

981
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,040
Who needs sleep?

982
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,040
Thank you.

983
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,900
I was never sure I liked her.
Nanny West?

984
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:34,960
It's not for me to have an opinion,

985
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:37,020
but I will say this...

986
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,100
Where did you get to last night?

987
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,900
I was fast asleep before you came in
and you were sleeping when I left.

988
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,080
I'm afraid it was very late.

989
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:06,060
But I'm glad you're here now
because I want you to know

990
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,900
that we owe a great debt
to Barrow, here.

991
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:15,060
It turns out Miss West is quite
unsuited to the role of Nanny.

992
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:17,900
She is leaving today.
What? Not another one.

993
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,080
Trust me. We'll talk later.
I must run or I'll be late.

994
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,100
Barrow, I meant what I said.
Thank you.

995
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,140
I'm glad, your ladyship.

996
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,000
I just had a hunch that she
wasn't quite all Sir Garnet.

997
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,080
I've no problem,
as long as you test them first.

998
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,940
I'm so sorry to miss your arrival.

999
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,020
That's all right, m'lady.
We've not begun to eat.

1000
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,060
Come and sit here.
I'll manage very well at the end.

1001
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,960
Carson can find me a chair.

1002
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,080
No. Sit here. I'll go to the end.

1003
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,960
This is your place.

1004
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,940
Are you sure you have time for this?
Quite sure.

1005
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,080
I've been looking forward to it.

1006
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:22,020
Now, Mr Taylor. What's all this
I hear about your giving up sheep?

1007
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,100
Well, m'lady, it's not
quite as simple as that.

1008
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:29,080
If truth be told,
I'd rather be farming livestock...

1009
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,040
And why is that?

1010
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,960
There's a letter from Matthew.
Where?

1011
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,960
Hidden in a book in the office.

1012
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,940
Are you trying to hide
from the truth?

1013
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,000
That you would prefer to be
in sole charge of the estate.

1014
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,140
There's bad feeling
between Braithwaite and Anna.

1015
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,100
M'lord?
Anna has been a little unkind.

1016
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,100
What's so funny?
Nothing, Mr Bates.

1017
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,020
I want "Tom"
to be your instructor.

1018
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:06,020
Are we to do all this
without telling Papa?

1019
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,980
There can be too much truth
in any relationship.

1020
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,940
Lady Rose asked me if I'd
chaperone her to a The Dansant.

1021
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,120
Keep her out of trouble.

1022
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,940
Do you want to be arrested?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

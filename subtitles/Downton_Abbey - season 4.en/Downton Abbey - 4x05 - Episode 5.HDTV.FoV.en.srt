1
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,100
I don't know why you always
wait for me. There's no need.

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
I want to be the first
to greet you every day.

3
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,120
Well, as I said...there's no need.

4
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,140
There's -

5
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,140
There's every need.

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,980
And I will keep it up until you
explain to me what has gone wrong
between us. Explain what?

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
My life is perfect.

8
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,160
And then, in the space of one day,
it is nothing.

9
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,060
To me, that requires an explanation.

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,060
Oh, good morning, Miss Baxter.
Hello, Mr Bates, Mrs Bates.

11
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,100
I wondered if you'd help me.
We will, if we can.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,980
It's my sewing machine.
I have no sockets in my room.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,020
And, as the sewing room
is in the laundry wing,

14
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,020
I wondered if Mrs Hughes might let
me use it in the servants' hall.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,140
I should ask her, if I were you.
Yes, of course.

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,020
I'll do that.

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,080
What do you make of her?

18
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,180
She's nice. Which prompts me to
wonder what she sees in
our friend Thomas.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,180
You know the old saying.

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,020
'There's nowt so queer as folk.'

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,140
We'll miss breakfast,
if we're not careful.

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,040
Are you happy for us to be
teaching Alfred to cook?

23
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,180
It's Mr Carson you should ask.

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
Ask me what?
About the kitchen staff

25
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,140
helping Alfred to train for his test.

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,140
He's been accepted for it, then?
Not yet, no.

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,120
But he'd like to be ready if he is.
I suppose it's all right.

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,180
Alfred is a hard worker.
I'll give him that.

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,100
And if cooking's his chosen path...

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,240
Good. I was just checking
I wasn't inciting a revolution.

31
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,080
There we are...My Lady.

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,220
I think I've remembered everything.
But...

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll just stay here while you check.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,220
It seems perfect, but...
What's this?

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,140
Well, I know Americans often
drink orange juice with breakfast.

36
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,140
So I thought you might like it.

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,100
That is so considerate, Baxter.

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,180
Thank you.

39
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
Good morning, My Lord.
Good morning.

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,020
You look very jovial.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
It's just Baxter reminding me
of times gone by.

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,240
You're pleased with her.
I am, thank heaven.

43
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,100
What's your day looking like?
Tom and Mary have summoned me
to the library.

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,220
They have an idea.
I hope it's not something
you're going to fight about.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,120
How can I answer that
when I don't know what it is.

46
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,100
So if we find a job for the boy,
it'll make a difference
to his mother.

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,060
Oh, a big difference. If you really
want to help Mrs Pegg,

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,220
this will be of more use than
a world of tea and sympathy.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,140
Well, I don't need anyone else here.
I know.

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,100
But would you talk to
the head gardener up at the abbey?

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,220
Or maybe even talk to Lady Grantham.
She takes her garden seriously.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,100
You don't have to tell me that.

53
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,180
I'm sorry. When's the funeral?

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,140
Tomorrow. Will you go?

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,100
I will. His forebears have been
tenants since the reign
of George III.

56
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,980
Be that as it may,
the rent's not been paid for ages.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,140
We've served all the papers.
It's time to get on with it.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,100
You mean, foreclose the lease
and farm the land ourselves?

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,140
That's what we discussed.

60
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,140
It's sad, though.

61
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,020
After such a long time
in the hands of one family.

62
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,180
The world moves on,
and we must move with it.
So you keep telling me.

63
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,220
Talking of the world moving on,
I suppose you've seen this.

64
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,140
'The engagement is announced between
the Viscount Gillingham

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,140
and the Honourable Mabel Lane Fox,

66
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,000
only child of the late
Lord Osweston.'

67
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,060
Well, I must...
write and congratulate him.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Now...let me get on.

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,180
But it's electric. Aren't you
worried it'll run away with itself

70
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,140
and sew your fingers to the table?

71
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,980
I certainly hope not.
How do you operate it?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,040
With a pedal - under my foot.
Well, I don't think it has
any business in a servants' hall.

73
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,060
But there's no socket in her room.
She could take it to the laundry.

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Or, better still,
chuck it out altogether!

75
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,180
Mrs Patmore is not
what you'd call a futurist

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,040
I think I'd got there already

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,220
Anna.
I've forgotten something.

78
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,120
You must forgive me, Mr Bates.
I'm afraid I'm keeping Anna too busy.

79
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,040
Would you like to have a try?

80
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Anna?

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,160
I don't know why you must be
so hard on Mr Bates.

82
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,180
At least you know now there'll be...
no baby.

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,180
No.

84
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,140
Then, can't you start
to get past it and...

85
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,100
and tell him something?

86
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
He'd know if it wasn't the truth.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,180
He sees through me.
He can read me like a book.

88
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,180
I wish he could read you.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
And take you out of this...
veil of shadows.

90
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,060
Don't you want to be honest with him?

91
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,060
Of course I do.

92
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,240
But I know him. I know what he'd do.

93
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,200
And I can't risk his future.

94
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,060
Well...it's your secret and not mine.

95
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
But I think it's a mistake.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,980
And you're sure
you have a feel for gardening?

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,100
I am, Your Ladyship. I'm not
a ladyship. Just Mrs Crawley.

98
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,180
I...I don't know much now.
But I'm a grafter.

99
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,180
And a quick learner.

100
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,240
I cannot make promises, but I will
try and find something for you.

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,020
Thank you very much, Your Ladyship.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,220
Will you show him out?

103
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,100
He's going to be so disappointed
when he finds out how ordinary
I really am.

104
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,080
You're part of the family.
That's how the village sees you.

105
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,100
It's not how the family see me.

106
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,080
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

107
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,060
Lord and Lady Grantham have always
been as kind as they can be.

108
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,020
And I appreciate it. But I am not one
of them. And that's the end of it.

109
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,020
Lord Grantham admires you very much.

110
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,180
But if it serves you to think
yourself unloved, nothing I
say will change that.

111
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,120
I think that's rather harsh.

112
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,180
Lord Grantham.
It was a very good service.
Your father would've been pleased.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,180
Thank you.

114
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,120
Do you have far to go?
I'm staying at Yew Tree Farm.

115
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,140
Of course.

116
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,060
Let us know when you're
ready to leave. There's no hurry.

117
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
The thing is, My Lord,
I...don't want to move out.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,980
I want to take on the tenancy.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What?
If it's still possible.

120
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,080
I'm sorry to be the one to say it,
but I don't believe it is.

121
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,240
The notices have been served.
The case is closed.

122
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,120
You mean,
you want to farm the land yourself.

123
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,180
Then it's all settled.

124
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,140
Mr Drewe, it's no good
painting me as Simon Legree.

125
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,060
We gave your father a long time
to get straight.

126
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,120
And left him in peace
at the end of his life.

127
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,160
He never told me about the debt.

128
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Or I'd've tried to help him.

129
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,120
Because my ancestors have farmed at
Yew Tree since the Napoleonic Wars.

130
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,080
Surely, that's got to mean something.

131
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,080
It means a great deal to me.

132
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,100
Then, can we talk about it, My Lord?

133
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
Please?

134
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
Come tomorrow morning, if you wish.

135
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
But I can't see
what good it will do.

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,140
Don't take it off too soon.
Let it bubble a bit,
or you'll taste the flour.

137
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,060
So...is this enough?
I'd say so, yeah.

138
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,100
Now put it to one side
while you check your casings.

139
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,980
My, my. Something smells good.
Alfred's making tarts with
an egg and cheese filling. Oh.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,220
Bouchees de fromage.
They could be tonight's savoury.

141
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
Do you think? I don't see why not.
I'll fetch the eggs.

142
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,060
Well done, Daisy.
It's very hard, Mrs Patmore.

143
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,240
I feel like I'm helping him
to leave us. And so you are.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,040
Which is as it should be,
now he's decided to go.

145
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,180
So, what's next? We'll add
egg and cheese to the white sauce,
if Mrs Patmore doesn't mind.

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,160
I don't mind at all, Daisy. You can
help him enrich the bechamel.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Your Ladyship. My Lady.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,980
Is that the afternoon post?
Is there anything for me?

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
There's just a couple
for His Lordship, My Lady.

150
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Were you expecting something?

151
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,220
Not particularly.

152
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,060
I haven't heard from Michael
in a bit, that's all.

153
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
I expect he's busy.

154
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,220
What have you been up to?

155
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,060
I was writing to Tony Gillingham.

156
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Give him my regards.

157
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,140
Say we look forward to knowing
Miss Lane Fox.

158
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,020
I am surprised.
I thought he was rather keen on you.

159
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
Not for the first time, you've
got the wrong end of the stick.

160
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,180
Oh. I thought you were Robert.

161
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,140
Is he back from his funeral?
Not yet, I don't think.

162
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,060
While he's not here,
shall we discuss his birthday?

163
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,140
Oh, does he have a birthday soon?
Fairly soon.

164
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,000
Do you have any plans?

165
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,060
Nothing beyond his favourite food.

166
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,240
It's not a special one.
Why don't we have a party?

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
To cheer ourselves up. A small one.
That'll be fun.

168
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,140
But Maley may have a candidate
of his own that he wants
to bring forward.

169
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,140
So, you do need extra help.

170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
I suppose so.

171
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,220
The last boy went off
to a frightfully grand rectory.

172
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Then, will you take young Pegg?

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,060
He impressed me so favourably.

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,120
You know, I wonder your halo
doesn't grow heavy.

175
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,140
It must be like wearing a tiara
round the clock.

176
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,060
Will you help him?
His mother would be very grateful.

177
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,100
And so would I. Yes, but
your gratitude never seems to last.

178
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,060
I've no sooner said yes than
you come back with another request.

179
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,160
Will you?

180
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,220
Very well. Very well.

181
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,120
But he'd better turn out
to be all the things you say he is.

182
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,980
Thought I'd get an extra
10 minutes in before the gong goes.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can help me with this.

184
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,240
Sybbie says there's going to be
a hurricane any moment now.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,020
A hurricane? Really? In Yorkshire?

186
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,020
So we're getting all the animals
under shelter.

187
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm sure you are. Where's Nanny?
Collecting some clothes
from laundry.

188
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,120
I said I'd stay with them.
She's so much more relaxed
than our nanny ever was.

189
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,180
My childhood wasn't
anything like Sybbie's.

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,080
Nor mine, God knows. Do you think
she's having a good childhood?

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,060
That we're doing well? I think
you're doing your best for her...
if that's what you mean.

192
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,060
It isn't quite.

193
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,140
Oh. I think it's time
for the hurricane.

194
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,200
Whoo!
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

195
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,180
This came for you in the last post.

196
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,020
Is that the letter that says if
they'll see you? I think it must be.

197
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,160
Well, open it, then. Oh, go on.
Don't keep us in suspense.

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
I want it so much. I can't bear
to find out I've not got it.

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,120
Give it to me, then.

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,980
Well, they are going to test you.
Oh, they are.

201
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,040
But, by 'eck.
It's the day after tomorrow.

202
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,220
They don't give you much time.
Oh, this was posted 10 days ago.
It must've got lost.

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,240
He'll be fine.
He knows his stuff.

204
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,040
Course he does. Doesn't he, Daisy?
He does, yeah.

205
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,020
What's this?
Alfred's got his test. At The Ritz.

206
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm happy for you, Alfred.
Anna...

207
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,040
That's the gong.

208
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,180
I shouldn't worry, Mr Bates.
She's got ever so much on her plate.

209
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Haven't we all?

210
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,840
Oh, bravo!
Very good!

211
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,740
She's right.
I couldn't have done better myself.

212
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,920
Now. Take them up
and say you cooked 'em.

213
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,700
I couldn't.
Well, Mr Carson can say it.

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,860
And what are they supposed to do?
Hang out the flags?

215
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,800
Oh, don't grudge him his success.
I don't.

216
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,920
I just can't see the fun
in a life chained to a stove.

217
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,720
Are the savouries ready to go up?

218
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,780
They certainly are.

219
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,720
I say. Well done.
We'll be sorry to lose you, Alfred.

220
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,800
But I think you'll pass your test.
Fingers crossed, My Lady.

221
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,860
When is it? The day after tomorrow.
I'm going up in the morning.

222
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,720
Our best wishes go with you.

223
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,720
I'm going up myself tomorrow.
Oh?

224
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,860
Just for the day.
To visit Michael's office.

225
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
I'll be back for dinner.

226
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,820
All alone?
I seem to be.

227
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,860
I don't know why.

228
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,860
How are you getting on with
Her Ladyship?

229
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,880
Pretty well...I think.

230
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,700
You've done America and
praised Lady Sybil? Have I not

231
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
You name it, I've said it.

232
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,920
She'll be eating out of your hand.
That's the intention.

233
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,720
No enemies downstairs neither.

234
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,760
That was Miss O'Brien's mistake.

235
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,840
Nobody liked her,
so nobody told her anything.

236
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,800
They don't like you much.
That's why you're here.

237
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,780
To rectify that failing on my part.

238
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Is it true you've moved
into the house again?

239
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,860
Mrs Hughes said so.
It seemed easier when I was looking
after Her Ladyship as well as you.

240
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,940
But she has her own maid now.

241
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Why not go back to the cottage?

242
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,940
I haven't got round to it.

243
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,940
Anna, if you're in difficulties,
I wish you'd tell me.

244
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm not, My Lady. Honestly.

245
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,920
I've come to say goodbye.
Thank you for all your help.

246
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,780
Just keep calm. You know enough
to do well if you keep calm.

247
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,920
Very good luck, Alfred.
Is there anything I ought to
know about London?

248
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,840
There's quite a lot you ought to
know about London, dear.

249
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,820
And no time to tell it now
or he'll miss his train.

250
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,760
This afternoon,
when Her Ladyship comes down,

251
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,720
I don't want any backchat -
she must see everything is in order,
all neat and tidy.

252
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,920
What's happened to your apron?

253
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
Why? What should -

254
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,840
Oh, my God!
What's up?

255
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,700
Well...I must've
caught it on a nail.

256
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,800
My other's in the wash.
And Her Ladyship's due!

257
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,700
Oh, don't worry. Miss Baxter'll
sort that out. Give it here. Right.

258
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,800
I thought you wouldn't mind if
Alfred rode in the front, My Lady.

259
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,920
He's catching the same train.
Of course I don't mind.

260
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,880
We all wish you luck, Alfred.
I'm going to need it, My Lady.

261
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,860
It's his first trip to London.
How exciting.

262
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,740
Exciting's one word for it.

263
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,840
You want to reverse the foreclosure
and take the lease,

264
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,880
but you still can't pay
all the arrears.

265
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,880
It doesn't seem
a very enticing offer.

266
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,800
I'll pay. And it won't take long.

267
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,720
Even so...

268
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,740
I'm a Yorkshireman, My Lord.

269
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
This is where I belong.

270
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,860
We've worked this land
in partnership with the Crawleys

271
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,880
for more than a century.

272
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,740
In partnership with the Crawleys?

273
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,800
I don't mean to be impertinent.
I do not hear it as impertinence.

274
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
We have been in partnership.

275
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,880
We're in partnership with
all our tenants. Or, we should be.

276
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,740
Then, will you let me come home?

277
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
I'll see what I can do.

278
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,740
Thank you, My Lord.

279
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,800
I'll be at the farm.

280
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Mr Drewe.

281
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,740
I would prefer to report that you
are prepared to repay the
arrears in full.

282
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
I'll lend you the difference myself.

283
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,780
You'd do that for me?

284
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,680
It won't be less than £50.
I'll send a cheque
when I'm sure of the outcome.

285
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
You won't regret it.
No.

286
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
I don't think I will.

287
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,840
Do you think Alfred has a chance
with his cooking?

288
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,840
I think he's got more than a chance,

289
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,820
judging by what Mrs Patmore
has to say on the subject.

290
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,780
Because I've got an idea that might
kill two birds with one stone.

291
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,900
We'll be short of a footman any day
and Mr Molesley will be
short of a job.

292
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,840
What say we deal with
the two problems together?

293
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,840
And solve both.
Exactly.

294
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,800
- But would he do it?
- Would he do it

295
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,800
When he's been mending roads
and delivering groceries,

296
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,880
and lucky to get even that?
I'll say he'll do it.

297
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,840
I hope you're right.
I know I am.

298
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,880
You might've talked it over with us
before you made up your mind.

299
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,840
But I haven't. I told him
we'd think about it. That's all.

300
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,840
Sounds to me as if
you've come to a decision.

301
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,860
If we don't respect the past,
it'll be harder to build our future.

302
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,880
Where did you read that?
I made it up.

303
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,760
I thought it was rather good.
It's too good.

304
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,920
One thing we don't want
is a poet in the family

305
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
Would it be so bad?

306
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,720
The only poet peer
I am familiar with is Lord Byron.

307
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,940
And I presume you all know
how that ended.

308
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,760
So, you'd let Mr Drewe stay on.
Since he wants to repay the debt,
I think it only fair.

309
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,720
Besides, he talks of the partnership
between the farmers and the family,
and I like that.

310
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,800
Well, I think it's splendid.
Says the queen of the rebels

311
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,740
Thank you. And you agree, even though
he has no right to renew the lease?

312
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,760
No right legally, no.
But we think he has a moral right.

313
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,940
It's a pity it should be Yew Tree.
It would've filled a hole in
the land we farm.

314
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,720
You've managed without it till now.
You haven't said what you think.

315
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,860
Which side are you on?
The farmer's, of course.

316
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,800
I've not abandoned all my socialism.
Even though it feels like it
sometimes.

317
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,840
In this one and only instance,
I am glad to hear it.

318
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,820
When will you tell him?
There's no tearing rush.

319
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,940
We've a day or two to talk it over.
And then you can tell him.

320
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,720
It's strange...standing here
next to you in silence.

321
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,940
Because I love you.

322
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,780
I want to find out
why you don't love me any more.

323
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,920
You'd think we could talk about it.
But apparently not.

324
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
But I don't...

325
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm going into Ripon this afternoon
to get some things for Lady Mary.

326
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,720
If they miss me,
I'll be back before the gong.

327
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Well...

328
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,820
At least I know you'll be back
before the gong

329
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,720
Ooh! I can't get over
the speed of it.

330
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,740
I feel quite dizzy watching.

331
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,720
I don't think it'll show.

332
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,760
Show? It's better than it was
before I bought it.

333
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,840
Aw! Thanks very much.

334
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,760
Her Ladyship's on her way down.

335
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Another one roped to the chariot

336
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm grateful for this job, Thomas.

337
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,740
And we both know why.
But what's it all about?

338
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,760
Well, there's going to be changes
at Downton. There's bound to be.

339
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm sure.

340
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,780
So I want to know about
any plans upstairs.

341
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,940
Any detail, no matter how small.
Understand?

342
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,900
Did the other lady's maids
keep you informed?

343
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,740
Miss O'Brien, yes. But we fell out.

344
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,740
What about Mrs Bates?
Is she an enemy?

345
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
She knows what's going on.

346
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,760
No, she's not an enemy.
But she's incorruptible.

347
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,760
So we have nothing in common.

348
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,900
She's also silent.
Shouldn't think I've had four words
out of her since I arrived.

349
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,860
Just get them all to trust you...
and tell you everything.

350
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
Your Ladyship. How can I help?

351
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,800
I've come down to persuade you.
I just don't see why it's
better than an ice box.

352
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,940
Well, a refrigerator
is more efficient.

353
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,720
It keeps food fresh longer.

354
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,920
We won't need ice to be delivered.

355
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,760
But the papers will still
be delivered, and the groceries,
and all sorts.

356
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,760
Or are we to stop that too?

357
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,760
Mrs Patmore.

358
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,760
Is there any aspect of the present
day that you can accept without
resistance?

359
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,760
Well, My Lady.

360
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,920
You must do everything
Maley tells you.

361
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,760
I will, Your Ladyship.
John is keen to learn. Aren't you?

362
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,740
I am, ma'am. Because there's
always work for a good gardener.

363
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,840
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley.
She would not let me go until
I'd promised.

364
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,720
She would not relax her grip.

365
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,720
You make me sound very fervent.

366
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,840
Wars have been waged with
less fervour

367
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,940
Well, let's hope we win this one.
Good day, John.

368
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,880
Say what you like, but I know
you care about these things
as much as I do.

369
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,740
Nobody cares about
anything as much as you do.

370
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,820
This is it.

371
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,340
My name is Arsene Avignon.
I am the sous chef of The Ritz.

372
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,340
Today...you are going to make
four dishes.

373
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,320
Is that clear? Then, if you have
no questions, we will begin.

374
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,220
In 1917,
at our sister hotel in New York,

375
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,340
the chef, Monsieur Diat,
altered a soup made popular
by Monsieur Gouffe and...

376
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
the great Monsieur Escoffier.

377
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
What did he do?

378
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,380
He served it cold.
Very good. Yes, it was eaten cold.

379
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,340
Previously,
the name had been a simple one.

380
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,300
Leek and potato soup. But...

381
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,360
what was it called now?

382
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Vichyssoise.
It was Vichyssoise.

383
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,360
So...you all have
the instructions before you.

384
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,420
Please begin.

385
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,280
Mr Napier.

386
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,260
What?

387
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Hello, Mary.

388
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,280
I can still call you Mary?

389
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,380
Of course you can. How lovely.

390
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,220
What brings you here?

391
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm working on a government thing
and we've got some research
to do in Yorkshire.

392
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,420
I'm on a sort of...
reconnoitring expedition.

393
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,380
Lucky me.
I was in Thirsk, and I suddenly
thought, why not take a chance?

394
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,220
Well, I'm so glad you did.

395
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,280
Let me give you some tea.

396
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll get them to tell Mama and Papa
that you're here.

397
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
While I've got you alone...

398
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,340
You've been in my thoughts
a great deal...

399
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,200
since the whole...ghastly business.

400
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,240
That's nice to know.
Which is why it's lovely to
see you looking so um...

401
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,240
..lovely.

402
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,360
Hello. Lady Mary wants tea for four.

403
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,300
I'll...start again? Hello? Lady Mary
wants tea for four in the library?

404
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,380
It's not right, you know,
when you speak against Alfred.

405
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,280
Sorry. But imagine having
never been to London.

406
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,360
Dearie me.
I've not been to London.

407
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,360
And, for me, it just goes to show.

408
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,400
He may be nervous,
it may be a daunting prospect,
but he's got ambition.

409
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,440
It drives him. And I admire that.

410
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,360
Good.

411
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:45,200
Because I've got plenty of ambition
where you're concerned.

412
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,300
Don't be so soft.

413
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,300
So...what is this thing
you're working on?

414
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,340
It's all to do with
the rural economy. Very hush-hush.

415
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,400
Well, don't tell us if it's
meant to be a secret.

416
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
Well, it's...not like that.

417
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,360
A lot of landed estates
are in difficulty.

418
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,380
The department wants to assess
the damage of the war years.

419
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,380
Are they likely to survive,
and so on. And are they?

420
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,300
Some of them.
It sounds rather interesting.

421
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,280
It is. Interesting
and incredibly depressing.

422
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,200
Which places are you studying
in Yorkshire?

423
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,300
That I cannot say.
It wouldn't be fair on the owners.

424
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,420
But we have earmarked the ones
in serious trouble.

425
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,340
And you'll be glad to know
Downton's not among them.

426
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,220
Still, we'd love your opinion on
whether or not we're doing the right
things. Wouldn't we, Papa?

427
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
We don't want to add to his labours.

428
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,360
Where are you staying
while you're up here?

429
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,320
We haven't decided.
There's quite a good hotel in Ripon.

430
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,380
Nonsense. You must stay with us.
I couldn't possibly.

431
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,440
Why not?

432
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,220
Well, to start with, I'll have
my boss with me. Who's that?

433
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,420
Charles Blake.
Have you ever come across him?

434
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,180
I don't think so.
You must both stay here.

435
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,260
That way, we'll get the benefit
of all your knowledge
for the price of a couple of dinners.

436
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,400
What could be better than that?

437
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,420
Well, Mr Nugent.
You've done...quite well.

438
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,420
I know I can do better, sir,
if you give me a chance. I know it.

439
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,220
You haven't chosen to make your
living in the kitchen before now.

440
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
No. You see, my mother was keen -

441
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,280
You have worked instead as a footman
for the Earl of Grantham.

442
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,400
I have, yes.
And this has made you...unhappy?

443
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
I'll not say that.

444
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,420
But I want to do more with my life.

445
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,260
I see. Well,
we have difficult decisions ahead.

446
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,320
But don't worry.
We won't keep you waiting.

447
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,380
It's good of you...to let me
disturb your afternoon.

448
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
You see...

449
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,340
I have to get to the bottom
of what's troubling me.

450
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,180
And I believe you can help.

451
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I doubt that.
The thing is...I know you can.

452
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,340
I heard you questioning Anna about
why she was being so hard on me.

453
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
But that doesn't mean -
Yes. It does.

454
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,200
You know what this is about.

455
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,240
And you believe...
she should have told me.

456
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Well, I admit...

457
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
I think she should have.

458
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,300
But it is not for me to.

459
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,280
Then I can't stay here.
What?

460
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,360
I have been happy in this house.

461
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,240
Happier than I had any right to be.

462
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,380
But that only makes my present
situation all the harder to bear.

463
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,360
I can imagine.
Can you?

464
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,280
Can you, Mrs Hughes?
Because if you can...

465
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
..you will know why
I have to leave here.

466
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,380
My wife no longer loves me.

467
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,400
The sight of me is torture for her,
which is torture for me.

468
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,400
If you will not let me
hear the truth...

469
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,240
I will hand in my resignation now
and be gone before she gets back.

470
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
So be it.

471
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,340
Wait!

472
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,300
Where is Anna?
She...had an errand in Ripon.

473
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,280
It's not true.
Anna loves you very, very much.

474
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:33,200
And I think the pain of coming home
to find you gone would finish her.

475
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,300
So I will tell you what happened...
to make you stay.

476
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,400
And if I'm doing the wrong thing,
then I ask for the mercy of God.

477
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,220
I'm sorry, My Lady. They said you
wouldn't be in here before seven.

478
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
No. Nor would I be.

479
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,340
But I left a...letter on my desk.

480
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,340
Has anybody else -
Oh.

481
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,380
Has anybody else been in here?

482
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,360
I don't know, Your Ladyship.

483
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,380
No.

484
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
No, why would you?

485
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,300
That's all of it.

486
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,340
You haven't said when...it happened.

487
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,300
Haven't I?

488
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,240
Was it the last night
of the houseparty?

489
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,220
When she told me...

490
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,300
she fainted...and hit her head.

491
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,340
Is that when it happened?

492
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,260
Yes.
Then I know who it really was.

493
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
I've told you who it was.

494
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,360
But I don't believe you!

495
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,420
I think it was Lord Gillingham's
valet, who teased her

496
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,260
and flirted with her
from the moment he arrived.

497
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,360
It was not Lord Gillingham's valet.

498
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,260
I don't believe he ever
left the concert. It was not him.

499
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,260
Do you swear that?
Why should I swear?

500
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,260
You must swear it -
on everything you hold dear!

501
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,340
Will you?
I've said...

502
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,260
It was an outsider. It was no-one
who was staying in the house.

503
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,300
A man broke in and waited down here.
How many times must I repeat it?

504
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Do you swear?

505
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,360
Very well. If it makes you
feel better, I swear.

506
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,220
On your mother's life?
She is dead. On her grave.

507
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,180
I've said I swear!

508
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,260
Because I will find out who he is.

509
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
You're welcome to try.

510
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,400
But I don't know
what you've got to go on.

511
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,260
Ah, there you are.
How did you get on?

512
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Oh, fine.

513
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,400
I hear Evelyn Napier
was here earlier.
I'm sorry to have missed him.

514
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,260
Yes, he just dropped in.
It was a spur of the moment thing.

515
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Is he still in pursuit of Mary?

516
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,420
I didn't ask him.

517
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,300
So, will you be giving
a birthday party? For Robert?

518
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,280
Why? Do you really want me to?

519
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,420
I'd had rather a good idea for it.
That's all.

520
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,280
If I did, would you give me a hand?
Absolutely. Shh!

521
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,260
So. Have we come to
a final decision about Drewe?

522
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,400
I suppose so.
If it means that much to you.

523
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,340
And Tom's socialism will ensure
his approval of the plan.

524
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,420
You laugh. But, as a matter
of fact, I've been thinking about
it quite a lot lately.

525
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,180
About what?
My beliefs, I suppose. I'm not
too sure what they are any more.

526
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,380
Since the houseparty - I won't hear
another word about the houseparty.

527
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Somebody said something
to upset you. That's all it is.
What was this? Who was rude?

528
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,300
No-one. He's got that wrong.

529
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,260
I just...felt like an intruder.

530
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,400
It made me face the fact that
I'm living where I don't belong.
Welcome to the club

531
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:36,340
Oh, stop moaning.
But, if you went back to Ireland,
Tom, would you belong there?

532
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,280
No. I don't think I would.
You've changed me too much.

533
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,220
I'm a man without a home.
I am stateless.

534
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,260
Well, then...
There is America.

535
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,360
I have family there
and they're doing quite well.

536
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:51,220
It would be a new start.
But you've made a new start here.

537
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,440
But I'm talking about
the world Sybbie will grow up in.

538
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,220
Wouldn't it be easier for her
to begin with a clean slate,

539
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,400
rather than being the daughter of
an uppity chauffeur?

540
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,180
Well, don't do anything in a hurry.

541
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,420
We don't want to lose you, Tom.

542
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,280
What do you mean,
you'll have to think about it?

543
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:11,380
What I say. I didn't mind helping
you out when you were short-staffed.

544
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,420
How good of you But to accept a
permanent position as a footman...

545
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,320
I'm a trained valet, Mr Car-
I'm a trained butler!

546
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,300
To accept...my fall by taking
a permanent, inferior place...

547
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,400
You keep telling me it's permanent.

548
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,440
But from where I'm sitting, it's
looking less permanent by the minute!

549
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
I shall give it every consideration.

550
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,200
Very generous, I must say

551
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,180
I'll let you know my answer
when I have one.

552
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,200
I shall wait with bated breath

553
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,220
Aren't you ever
going to finish that?

554
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,240
It's nearly midnight.

555
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,220
Someone has to do it. But it
doesn't always have to be you.

556
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,240
I know.

557
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
I know what happened.

558
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,360
Mrs Hughes told me. I forced her to.

559
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:45,300
Then, she was very wrong.
It wasn't her secret to tell.

560
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I gave her no choice, Anna.

561
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
What did she say?

562
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,360
How...

563
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,300
How it happened.

564
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
When it happened.

565
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I asked if it was Green.

566
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,440
Who?
Mr Green.

567
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,300
Lord Gillingham's valet.
She swore it wasn't.

568
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,240
No, it wasn't him.
She said a man...

569
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,200
..broke in and was waiting
down here for you, a stranger.

570
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,380
That's right.

571
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Because, if it was the valet...

572
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
..he is a dead man.

573
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,340
It wasn't him! You only say that
because you didn't like him.

574
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,300
No, I did not.

575
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,320
There's no excuse to accuse him
when he did nothing.

576
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,360
Would I have sat at breakfast with
him next morning if it'd been him?

577
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,380
We can't know who the man was.

578
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,240
We have no way of tracing him.

579
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,360
Why wouldn't you tell me?

580
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,280
Because I knew the suffering
it would bring you.

581
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Well, it's in the open.

582
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,360
No more secrets.

583
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm glad of that, at least.

584
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,360
No more fear of being found out.
Because I am found out.

585
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
My shame has nowhere to hide.

586
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,340
Why do you talk of shame?

587
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,340
I don't accept that
there is any shame in this.

588
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
But I am spoiled for you.

589
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,200
And I can never be unspoiled.

590
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,320
You are not spoiled.

591
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,240
You are made...

592
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,260
higher to me...

593
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,280
and holier because of the suffering
you have been put through.

594
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,340
You are my wife.

595
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
And I have never been prouder...

596
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,440
..nor loved you more
than I love you now at this moment.

597
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
Truly?

598
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,200
Truly.

599
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
Morning.

600
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,320
Alfred.

601
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,360
Is that the result?

602
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,300
I think so, yes.
Do you want me to open it?

603
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,360
No, I'll do it myself.
Good luck.

604
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:51,220
Well?

605
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,340
I've not got it.
What?

606
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,420
Oh, I am sorry.
It says I did well and I was nearly
in the top four, but not quite.

607
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,380
I expect they say that to everyone.
That's enough, James.

608
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,380
And Alfred - to fail at the first
attempt does not mean that you
won't succeed later.

609
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,340
Quite right.
Might I have a word, Mr Carson?

610
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Certainly.

611
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
I've given it a lot of thought.

612
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,440
Have you, indeed
First,

613
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,300
I needed to deal with
my father's disappointment,

614
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,300
when he learned of my downward path.

615
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,340
But I weighed it against the power
to do good that all employment
brings.

616
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,180
Did you, now?
And you thought all that.

617
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,340
I feel I could contain my skills
and guide them

618
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,180
into a...more modest channel
without loss of dignity.

619
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,380
Just fancy
So, all in all...

620
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,220
and after mature deliberation,
you'll be pleased to hear that
I can accept your offer.

621
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,340
What offer?
To replace Alfred as footman.

622
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,380
Oh, dear, Mr Molesley. I'm afraid
that Alfred's not leaving now.

623
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,260
It's a pity you didn't
accept the job when we last talked.

624
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,300
And then I'd have been
stuck with you.

625
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,220
As it is, you've missed your chance.

626
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
As I generally do.

627
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Mature deliberation

628
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,240
Cheer up, lad.

629
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,220
You read the letter.

630
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,420
You were a very near miss. So,
next time, you'll hit the target.

631
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,400
I reckon Jimmy's right.
They say that to everyone who fails.

632
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,220
Well, I reckon you work hard
and you deserve to succeed.

633
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
You just have to stick at it...
and you will.

634
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
I'm not saying he took it.

635
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,220
But I don't see
who else could've done.

636
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,260
In other words,
you're saying he took it.

637
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,420
I know he was in this room.

638
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,260
Legitimately.
Really, Dr Clarkson. I'm not
a witness for the prosecution.

639
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,400
Aren't you?
Well, let us review the facts.
I have lost a valuable paper knife.

640
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,220
Given to the late Lord Grantham
by the King of Sweden.

641
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,440
Which makes all the difference

642
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,260
It makes the loss greater, yes.

643
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,320
I quite agree.

644
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,220
But I can't accept there's any
real proof against erm...young Pegg.

645
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
Well, if you insist,
I won't sack him. Yet.

646
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
But I will not allow him
back in the house.

647
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,380
And I will have to speak
to my head gardener about it.

648
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,340
That will do him a lot of harm.
Well, what would you prefer?

649
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,240
That I invite the local criminals
to drop in and strip the house bare?

650
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Why not ask to be told
when a gardener is coming inside?

651
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,220
So that you or a servant
can keep watch.

652
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,380
Then we'll have time to investigate
the loss of the knife.

653
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,440
Or have you already scented blood?
As a matter of interest,
do you ever doubt?

654
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,360
I don't doubt the honesty
of young Pegg.

655
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,240
That is not at all what I asked.

656
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,340
I'm very grateful, My Lady.

657
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,440
You didn't have to do this,
but it determines me to prove
I'm worthy of your faith.

658
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,360
I can't pretend to take the credit,
Mr Drewe.

659
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,280
It was His Lordship
who was determined you should stay.

660
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,300
You owe your thanks to him.

661
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,300
He'll have my thanks, My Lady.

662
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:11,260
And he'll have the rest of
the payment before he's missed it.

663
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,340
What payment?
Remainder of the debt.

664
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,380
I thought you'd know about it.
And so we do.

665
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,220
Of course we do. I'm sorry.
I was being absent-minded.

666
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,220
How much is it? I've forgotten.

667
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,220
It's only the last £50.

668
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,340
He sent a cheque so I can pay off
the full amount and wipe
the slate clean.

669
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,280
Well, thank you, Mr Drewe.
I'm sure we have many fruitful
years ahead of us.

670
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Are you going to challenge him?

671
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:48,260
No. If Papa believes enough in Drewe
to lend him the money,

672
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,440
and to hide it from us,
then that tells me something.

673
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:56,380
What, exactly? That you and I are in
partnership with a very decent man.

674
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
Mrs Hughes, can I have a word?

675
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,340
I know you told Mr Bates about me
while I was out yesterday.

676
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,200
He put me in a very...difficult...

677
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm afraid he guessed who it was.

678
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,220
But you denied it.
Denied it?

679
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,380
I swore on my mother's grave
it wasn't him...God help me.

680
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,260
He seems to have accepted your word.

681
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,220
In fact...
I'm moving back into the cottage.

682
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,280
Oh! Oh, I'm...I'm so pleased.

683
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,260
At least if I'm damned for all
eternity, it was to some purpose.

684
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,280
You won't be damned.

685
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,220
Mr Bates has shown
great generosity of spirit.

686
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,360
As I knew he would. Eventually.

687
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,280
So...we're going to try and put
the whole thing behind us.

688
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,220
I hate to think of that evil man
getting away scot free.

689
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,400
But maybe it's for the best.

690
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,320
I thought you'd like to know.

691
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,240
What are you grinning about?
What do you think? He's not going.

692
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,280
Mr Bates. I'm so glad to see you.

693
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,220
Anna's told me
what's gone on between you.

694
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,320
And it's made me
happier than I can say.

695
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,320
To think it's all
over and done with.

696
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,280
Nothing's over and done with,
Mrs Hughes.

697
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,400
But Anna said -
Do you think I would add to her
burden, after all she's been through?

698
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,240
I don't know his name,
so I can't tell it to you.

699
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,220
Not if you were to threaten me
with a knife, Mr Bates.

700
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,220
I understand. And I won't press you.

701
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,220
But be aware.

702
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
Nothing is over.

703
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
And nothing is done with.

704
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,300
Michael's vanished into thin air.
If anything had happened, we'd know.

705
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,220
I was a fool to think
we could leave it behind.
I'm the failure here, not you.

706
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,440
Can I interrupt?

707
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,220
Mr Napier and Mr Blake
are here in a few days.

708
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,420
You're here to advise the landowners
on how to get through this crisis,
aren't you? Not quite.

709
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,300
You seem to have brought
a traitor into our midst.

710
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,300
Not a traitor.
I wonder you don't just set fire
to the abbey and dance round it.

711
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,180
Painted with woad and howling
I might. If it would do any good.

712
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,360
This came in the evening post.
Is anything the matter?

9999

2
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,840
Why didn't you wait for me?

3
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,240
I wanted to finish these before
breakfast. Is it something I've done?

4
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,200
No, not anything.

5
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
Nobody's done anything.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,880
Blimey. What happened to you?

7
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,200
Leave her alone. I fell. I cut my
lip.

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,640
Now, if either of you need help to
carry things down just ask.

9
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Alfred and James will be glad to
help. That's good to know.

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
What was that, James? Nothing, Mr
Carson.

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,200
I'd better go up. Lady Mary hasn't
rung yet.

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,240
I've things to do.

13
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,840
How was Anna when you lent her that
dress last night?

14
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,880
How should she be? She told me she'd
fallen and cut her lip,

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
but I wondered if it might be more
serious.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,560
She always minimises things. I'm sure
I don't know anything you don't know.

17
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,240
What's the matter with everyone this
merry morn?

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,480
I think there's something rather foreign
about high spirits at breakfast.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,080
I shall be supervising the departure
if anyone wants me.

20
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,800
Well, Mr Gillingham, I hope you
haven't forgotten anything.

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,720
On the contrary, Mr Carson. I shall
remember this visit for a long time.

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Goodbye, Lord Grantham, and thank
you for everything. Oh, nonsense.

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,800
I'm the one who should be thanking
you.

24
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,120
You look as if you're glad to see
the back of us.

25
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
No. You've been kind to me.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
I'm afraid I haven't been much fun
to be with.

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,800
Grief's odd, Tom. When the Duke died
it made me terribly clumsy.

28
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
I kept dropping and breaking things.

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,760
It was because it felt disloyal...

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,440
to manage anything properly without
him, do you see?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
But you could manage. Yes, I could.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,840
And so can you. I wonder.

33
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,960
The trouble is that I'm not really out
and all that. But it should be possible.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,040
I don't think people care about those
rules like they used to. Well, I don't.

35
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
The luggage is loaded, m'lord.

36
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,080
It's nice to see you're well looked
after.

37
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,200
It seems rather ungrateful, but I
can't pretend I like him.

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
But I'm lucky to have anyone
nowadays.

39
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,560
You said it.

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I'll say goodbye to Tony Gillingham.
Don't interrupt them yet.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
You're sure we can't meet?

42
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm sure you're much too busy and
I'll be chasing my tail.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
In other words, no.

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,320
I'm afraid you'll have to get
started. They won't hold the train.

45
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
Not even for you?

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,440
Not for me, nor for you either,
Duchess. Not these days.

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,760
You look very earnest.

48
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,560
I'm on my way to convince the board
of the merits of an out clinic,

49
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,720
so people can come early for
treatment.

50
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,240
I don't suppose... Don't suppose
what?

51
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
I could do with some help. I know you suspect
me of trying to get you back into harness.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,400
But, well, it would leave a nurse
free for other duties.

53
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,440
I'll think about it.

54
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,800
I will.

55
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,840
I promise.

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,640
The tax people have had a cancellation,
so they can see us on Wednesday at noon.

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,040
But we should go up tomorrow. I
wouldn't like to risk being late.

58
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,960
And you don't want me to come? No
point in you all going.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you afraid I might put the case
for selling? It's not a question of that.

60
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,720
They don't care how they get the
money so long as they get it.

61
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll ask how long they can give us and
what scale of payment they'll accept.

62
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Then I'll report back. And we'll make
a decision together.

63
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,760
But I will try to persuade you.

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,680
Even though you'd be dragging a debt
behind you for 20 years? I don't care.

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,520
Not if Downton is self-sufficient by
the end of it.

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,240
I can see I'll spend the rest of my
life paying by instalments.

67
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Papa, you always say we're not the
owners of Downton but the caretakers.

68
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Very well. Let's take care of it.

69
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Aunt Rosamund said we can stay with
her.

70
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Do you mind keeping an eye on the
children, Mama?

71
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,040
Is this London? When are you going?
Can I come?

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Tomorrow, and I don't see why not.
Nor me.

73
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,960
Will you meet Tony Gillingham while
you're there?

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't think so. Why should I?

75
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
Just thought you might.

76
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,280
Don't be transparent, Mama. It
doesn't suit you.

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,520
I thought you might come down to see
me.

78
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,000
After last night. Look, Edna,

79
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,880
I blush to admit it, but I was very
drunk.

80
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,400
So you're not going to deny it? Of
course not.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And if I behaved badly, I am sorry.

82
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,560
We'll have to put it down to our low
spirits and self indulgence.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,160
I suppose you're so cold because
you're ashamed of what you did.

84
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm neither cold nor ashamed. But,
as I say,

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
if I made a mistake, then I'm sorry.

86
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
I dare say we both are.

87
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,160
What are you making
there? Feuilletes.

88
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,920
What's that? Puff pastry layers with
asparagus.

89
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm doing the hollandaise. Do they really like
that stuff or do they order it to show off?

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,200
We don't all have to live off
battered fish and meat pies.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,800
It's the first thing Mrs Patmore's
trusted me with. First big thing.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm quite nervous. So you should be.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,880
Mess it up and it's back to
kindergarten.

94
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
What are you doing?

95
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
You can't treat a poor girl like
this.

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Like what? To use her one minute and
to cast her aside the next.

97
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,680
I've said I'm sorry - Yes, you're
sorry. I know.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
But suppose I'm pregnant.

99
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,600
What will you do then?

100
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,440
Don't be ridiculous. You can't be
pregnant. It's not as easy as that.

101
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
But it is. Just as easy.

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,440
Why talk about it now? You won't
know for weeks.

103
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,880
I must be sure that you'll marry me
if I'm carrying your child.

104
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,920
I need to know that you won't cast
me off, that you'll be a man of honour.

105
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,000
And don't say I'm not good enough.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,680
If you were good enough for Lady
Sybil Crawley, I'm good enough for
you. Don't speak her name.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
You weren't so severe last night.

108
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,720
All I need is your word that you'll
marry me if there's a baby.

109
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,160
Don't worry. If it happens, I mean
to make a go of being your wife.

110
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I won't hold you back.

111
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
You won't have any regrets.

112
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
I am already full of regrets.

113
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
There is nothing but regret in me.

114
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,880
Did you enjoy the concert? I did.

115
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,400
It was a great treat to hear Melba in
person.

116
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,640
Hm. And the evening generally?

117
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,400
You mean did I find it hard to see
Mary come alive again?

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes, I did, I confess it.

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,080
But I don't think my feelings are at
all defensible.

120
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,480
They are defensible to me. But it's
immoral

121
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,040
to react in such a jealous and
selfish way.

122
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Well, if we only had moral thoughts,

123
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,680
what would the poor churchmen find
to do?

124
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm fond of Mary.

125
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,760
I love her.

126
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't want her to be alone and
unhappy.

127
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
It makes no sense, even to me.

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,040
I don't criticise either you or her.

129
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,560
But I hope you find a way to make
friends with the world again.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,360
When we get to London, would you mind
helping Lady Rose?

131
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
We can't take Madge off Lady Edith.

132
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,520
Anna, are you all right? Yes.

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Only you've been very quiet.

134
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Will that be all, m'lady?

135
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Yes, I suppose so. Very good, m'lady.

136
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
I telephoned Rosamund.

137
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,840
I thought Mary was doing that. Yes,
but I wanted to speak to her.

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,600
That's a first. She'll give a little
dinner.

139
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
What about Tom? She said she won't
mind if he wants to be included.

140
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Who could resist such a love call?

141
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
She'll ask that young man for Rose,
so it won't be too obvious.

142
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,080
It'll be pretty obvious. Do you
think something might come of it?

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,520
Probably not but I wouldn't mind if
it did.

144
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,520
After all, being a family means
welcoming new members.

145
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Don't you agree, Braithwaite?

146
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,320
I think anyone would be lucky to be
a part of this family, m'lady.

147
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,520
That's nice. Thank you.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,160
Aren't we encouraging a nation of
hypochondriacs if they rush to a
doctor at every twinge?

149
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,440
I think it encourages people to look after
themselves and not become a burden.

150
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,640
So you mean to help? A little.

151
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
Just to provide some free labour. No
more than that.

152
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,760
I wish someone would provide me with
some free labour. Oh.

153
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Lloyd George would never allow it.

154
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,120
Rosamund is so looking forward to
seeing you. Poor Aunt Rosamund.

155
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,760
We use her like an hotel.
She enjoys it.

156
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,120
It gives her a surrogate real life.

157
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,680
What do you think, Tom? Do you think
she minds?

158
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Tom?

159
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I'm sorry. What were you saying?

160
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,080
I'd far rather know what you were
thinking.

161
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,360
Let me taste it. Go on, then.

162
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,000
It's like eating paper. Thank you.

163
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,760
I mean it. Do you really care about
this stuff?

164
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,160
I want to be a good cook. I want a
skill.

165
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
Why shouldn't I? You sound like
Alfred.

166
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
Well, what do you want?

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,320
To have a good time. To see the
world.

168
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,760
To meet beautiful women and spend
money and drink champagne.

169
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
You can't make a career out of that.

170
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,720
Some people do. I want a life that's
fun.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
I wish I was more like you.

172
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
I should report you to Mrs Patmore.

173
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Report me for what? You know.

174
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,160
No, he does not know and nor do I.
What don't you know?

175
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,520
Why everyone's making a fuss over my
cooking.

176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,080
Because you did well, Ivy. They're
not very hard.

177
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,480
They're hard enough for a beginner,
as you ought to remember.

178
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Yes, but Ivy moves so fast for a
beginner, don't she?

179
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,640
Just one night. We'll be back for
dinner on Wednesday.

180
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I'll miss you. Don't.

181
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm just tired.

183
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Before you ask, you've done nothing
wrong. I must have done something.

184
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,280
You won't talk to me, you won't look
at me. I can't come near you.

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
We're in each other's pockets.

186
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
We live together, we work together.

187
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,720
Sometimes I think it's just too much.

188
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
There's not a lot to say.

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,800
We worked in a few theatres
together.

190
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,680
She had a singing act with her
sister.

191
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,000
The Lark and the Dove they were
called.

192
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,240
Which was she? The dove, I suppose.

193
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Her sister had the voice...

194
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,680
but Alice was a gentle soul,

195
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
a sweet and a gentle soul.

196
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,240
And you were courting?

197
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,880
Well, you know how it was then.

198
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,880
Not like today. You were lucky if
you got to walk them to the corner.

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
But you wanted to marry her.

200
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,320
So much I could taste it.

201
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,760
I know, where is that young man now
so full of passion?

202
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,920
Anyway, she chose Charlie and that
was that.

203
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
But what's changed?

204
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
He told me that she regretted it.

205
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
That she wished she'd chosen me.

206
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,320
She's dead now, so it doesn't
matter, but that's what she said.

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,480
I disagree. It matters a lot.

208
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,520
The woman you loved... loved you.

209
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
But it doesn't change anything.

210
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,640
It changes you from where I'm
looking.

211
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,920
You're busy. No, no, no.

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,760
I'll say goodnight. Goodnight, Mr
Carson.

213
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,720
What is it?

214
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,480
When I get back from London I want to
move back upstairs.

215
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,080
What? Why, for heaven's sake?

216
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Because I can't...

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
..I can't let him touch me.

218
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,280
But whatever happened was not Mr
Bates's fault, surely?

219
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
Of course not.

220
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,000
He is without fault and that's the
point.

221
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I'm not good enough for him. Not now.

222
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,480
Why say that? Because I think that
somehow I...

223
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
..I must have made it happen.

224
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,560
Stuff and nonsense. You were
attacked by an evil, violent man.

225
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,240
There is no sin in that. But I feel
dirty.

226
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,400
I can't let him touch me because I'm
soiled.

227
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,920
Anna, I've been thinking.

228
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,040
We must go to the police. No.

229
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,320
But suppose you're with child. What
will you do then?

230
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll kill myself. I won't listen to
that.

231
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,320
No man should be able to do what he
did and get away with it.

232
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
And when Mr Bates has killed him,

233
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,160
will you come with me to the prison
when my husband is hanged?

234
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,200
But the poor man's heart is breaking
for not knowing.

235
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,880
Better a broken heart than a broken
neck.

236
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
So can I have a room, please?

237
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,840
You can.

238
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,920
You must wait until there's some
reason for you to give Mr Bates,

239
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,920
but I wish you would decide that
honesty is the best policy.

240
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,640
In the meanwhile, try to take a
break from it...

241
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
..while you're in London.

242
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
There can be no break from it.

243
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,640
Come and talk to me while I'm cleaning
them. I've got work to do. Five minutes.

244
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,520
Ivy can make the savoury. There's
only three of them, it'll be good practice.

245
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,800
What about me? Collect the trays
from the nursery and make the
pancakes for pudding.

246
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,200
Put them in the steam warmer. Have
you seen this?

247
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,840
What? They're setting up a training
school at the Ritz Hotel in London

248
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,760
in honour of Monsieur Escoffier.

249
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Just for a few candidates. How much
will it cost? Nothing.

250
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,720
If they pass the test they get free training,
a basic wage and the chance of a job after.

251
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,400
They have two examinations a year.
You could do that, Daisy.

252
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,640
Are you trying to get rid of me?
Where's Ivy? She ought to see it.

253
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
She's around here somewhere.

254
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
She's in the boot room.

255
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,920
Sorry to keep you waiting, but Anna
couldn't find -

256
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,520
Oh.

257
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,960
I hope I'm a surprise and not a
shock.

258
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Well, you're certainly unexpected.

259
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,240
I thought I'd get up a small party,
just an informal one.

260
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
You remember Sir John Bullock?

261
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,200
He and Lord Gillingham have just been
staying with us.

262
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,400
Cora said it had been a success.
How clever of you both to be free at
such short notice.

263
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,360
They brought your message to my
club.

264
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,520
I had an evening of cards and whisky
ahead so it was a welcome change of plan.

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,280
And what about you? Well, I cancelled
what I was supposed to be doing.

266
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,960
I hope Miss Lane Fox didn't mind.

267
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,600
Don't punish me for wanting to see
you again.

268
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,720
John's got a marvellous idea for
later on, haven't you?

269
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,520
After dinner I could take you all to
hear the new band at the Lotus Club.

270
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,800
You and Mary can be my chaperones, so
what could be more proper?

271
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,440
It isn't too jazzy, Lady Rosamund.
Just a club with a good dance band.

272
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
We can keep the young in order.

273
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,840
That's if you like the sound of it.

274
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Please say yes, Mary, do.

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,360
It's such eons since we've had any
fun.

276
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
What about you, Tom?

277
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,880
I'll stay here with Lady Rosamund.
Oh, I was thinking I might go, too.

278
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,680
That settles it. Tom can come as
Aunt Rosamund's partner.

279
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
Well?

280
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I give in.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,800
Some more champagne over here. I
don't need any more.

282
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,000
Nonsense. How can we keep going if we're
not properly fuelled? I can keep going.

283
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,720
His evening of cards and whisky had already
begun when he got your aunt's invitation.

284
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,880
# Still it holds a goodly share of
bliss...

285
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,280
I hope you don't mind my ambushing
you like this.

286
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,200
It was Mama and Aunt Rosamund who
ambushed me.

287
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
And I'm glad you came.

288
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,400
Really? Absolutely.

289
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,880
When I'm at Downton I feel so weighed
down,

290
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,720
as if I were stuck at school for the
rest of my life.

291
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,120
But tonight you've made me play
truant.

292
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
And I like it.

293
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
# ..flowers

294
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,000
# That bloom in May

295
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,920
# So if it's raining...

296
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Can I see you again before you go?

297
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,800
How? The meeting's at noon and then
we go straight to the station.

298
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,720
Oh.

299
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
# It's raining violets...

300
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,400
And, anyway, you've told me you're
engaged to be married.

301
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
Almost engaged.

302
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Almost is good enough for me.

303
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,960
And even if you weren't the truth
is...

304
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,080
..I'm not ready

305
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,280
and I won't be for some years.

306
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
I don't believe that.

307
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
Don't misunderstand me.

308
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,760
It's been lovely, here and at
Downton.

309
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,880
I feel quite refreshed.

310
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
But now it's time to go back to real
life again.

311
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
And that's doesn't include me.

312
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How could it?

313
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:08,680
# Whenever April showers
come along #

314
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,680
When I go through these I can tell
I've got some big gaps.

315
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,760
Make a list and we'll see what we
can do.

316
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,200
You'll help, won't you? Course.

317
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
I just think it's a shame if Alfred
has to go.

318
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,600
They might not even test me, let
alone offer me a place.

319
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,480
I couldn't go to London, me. Oh, you
could

320
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,280
if London was right for the next
step in your journey.

321
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,560
Are you sure you want to be a chef?
Not this chef business again.

322
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
Oh, just because you have no dreams.
I have dreams.

323
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,080
But they don't involve peeling
potatoes.

324
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,240
That's it, I'm off to bed. Me, too.
Goodnight, Mrs Patmore.

325
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,160
You must help him, Daisy.

326
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,080
Although it'll be hard,

327
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,760
it'll be better if you part friends,
I promise.

328
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,560
One moment of nastiness, and I'll be
paying for the rest of my days?

329
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
Maybe it's good if he goes.

330
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,000
Sometimes you can spend too long on
a one-sided love.

331
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,720
# I see a light in your eyes...

332
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,200
So, how are you enjoying it? What?

333
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
Being a member of the family
Crawley?

334
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,240
They've been kind to me. Kinder than
I deserve.

335
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Oh, I'm sure that's not true. It is
true. Too true.

336
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,360
Oh! Oh, dear! Er...

337
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
should we sit down?

338
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,120
Aunt Rosamund's gone back to the
table. Should we go?

339
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Absolutely not.

340
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Um... please.

341
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,680
We're making a show of ourselves.
Then let's put on a great show.

342
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,160
People are looking at us. Good. Let
them see how it's done.

343
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
John. Oh, my -

344
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,240
Are you all right? Oh, um...

345
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,520
He's not normally like that.

346
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,440
Oh, Mary.

347
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I don't think he is. I don't know
him that well.

348
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I should keep it that way.

349
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
I really am all right now.

350
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,960
Thank you, you've saved my face.
Jack Ross at your service.

351
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm Rose MacClare.

352
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,320
How do you do? Rose.

353
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
I've been sent to fetch you.

354
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Well, if your friends are waiting...

355
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm so sorry. This is my cousin, Tom
Branson.

356
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,880
This is Mr Ross. He rescued me from
deep humiliation.

357
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,560
We should be going.

358
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,240
There was no need to be rude. I
wasn't rude.

359
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,400
Where's John? I should think he's
gone home.

360
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,080
Well, have we all had enough? I hope
he paid the bill before he left.

361
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,680
Honestly. If it hadn't have been for
Mr Ross...

362
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,400
You were having quite an adventure
with your gallant band leader.

363
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,680
He was terribly nice. And...

364
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
..John had made me look such a fool.

365
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,960
# A violet renamed but still blue

366
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,400
# The dappled dew will form in
spring

367
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
# No matter what you call the thing

368
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,920
# So what's in a name?

369
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,840
# The grass is always greener

370
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,840
# On the other side... #

371
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,400
I'm going up. I'll come with you.
I'm whacked.

372
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm assuming Sir John Bullock has
blotted his copybook for you.

373
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,400
Oh, I don't know. Doesn't everyone
deserve a second chance? Not everyone, no.

374
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,240
Things have come to a pretty pass when you
have to be rescued by a black bandleader.

375
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,040
I was jolly pleased anyone wanted to
rescue me and so would you have been.

376
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,440
What's the matter? You've been in a
glump all day.

377
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
If I told you, you'd despise me.

378
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,800
It may surprise you to hear that I
said that to someone once.

379
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,840
But I did confess in the end and it
made things a lot better.

380
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,480
Well, I couldn't say it. Not to you.

381
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Then find someone you can tell.

382
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It will help more than you know.

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,040
And on that modest note... goodnight.

384
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,880
Goodnight.

385
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:44,051
I'm glad someone's cheerful.

386
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:46,356
Although I'm surprised it's you.

387
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:48,076
Why?

388
00:25:48,116 --> 00:25:51,796
You were very down in the mouth when
you were talking to Mr Branson.

389
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:56,756
You think you can read me like a
book, don't you?

390
00:25:56,796 --> 00:25:59,476
I pride myself on keeping my eyes
open, yes.

391
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:03,956
You'll need to keep your eyes open
and your ears too where I'm concerned.

392
00:26:04,636 --> 00:26:08,836
Meaning? Meaning there'll come a day
when you'll be glad you kept in with me.

393
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,676
Hello, James, Alfred.

394
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:24,516
Rose, Anna needs to use your curling
irons. All right. Mine are broken.

395
00:26:24,556 --> 00:26:26,276
Of course.

396
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:33,196
You're back.

397
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:35,396
Good.

398
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,436
How was it?

399
00:26:37,956 --> 00:26:39,956
All right.

400
00:26:40,276 --> 00:26:42,676
Lady Mary seemed quite pleased. Come
here.

401
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,716
Better get on. Kiss me.

402
00:26:44,756 --> 00:26:46,356
Please.

403
00:26:47,516 --> 00:26:50,836
Or tell me what's happened. One or
the other. Don't bully me.

404
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:55,356
Anna, you're upset. You're unhappy
and I don't know why.

405
00:26:56,756 --> 00:27:01,396
You say it's not me. I hope that's
true. But there is a reason and I
need to find out what it is.

406
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:07,436
I won't press you now if it makes things
worse but in the end I will find out.

407
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:13,276
Anna, could you tell Lady Mary, Lord
Gillingham is here?

408
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:14,996
Lord Gillingham?

409
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:18,276
But we just saw him in London.
Well, he's come back.

410
00:27:19,396 --> 00:27:21,396
Is his valet with him?

411
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:24,036
I mean, is he staying? She'll want
to know.

412
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:26,396
He doesn't seem to be.

413
00:27:26,956 --> 00:27:29,356
Now, will you give her the message,
please?

414
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:33,396
Well, this is a sorry tale.

415
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:36,636
Damn right it is. And it's all my
fault.

416
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:40,916
Not all but it is partly your fault.
There's no point in denying that.

417
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,396
And you expect me to help you with
it?

418
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:46,596
I couldn't think of anyone else to
turn to.

419
00:27:46,636 --> 00:27:49,796
Not the most flattering invitation
I've ever known.

420
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:53,676
The question is, what's to be done?

421
00:27:54,236 --> 00:27:56,516
Should I speak to her again? Should
I beg?

422
00:27:56,556 --> 00:27:58,556
We've not quite come to that.

423
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,156
It is you.

424
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:16,756
When Anna told me I thought there
must be a mistake.

425
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:19,916
How did you get here? On the same
train as you.

426
00:28:20,196 --> 00:28:22,156
But I was travelling in third.

427
00:28:22,196 --> 00:28:25,676
Why? Because I didn't want to speak
to you in a railway carriage

428
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:28,876
with, you know, Tom and everyone
else listening.

429
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:33,516
Would you like some tea? Yes, if I
may.

430
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:42,716
I assume you're going to give me an
explanation at some stage.

431
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,316
It's not complicated.

432
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,076
I have made a long journey to ask a
short question.

433
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,916
Will you marry me?

434
00:28:56,076 --> 00:28:57,956
Tony, you don't know me.

435
00:28:57,996 --> 00:29:01,276
How can you say that? We've known
each other since we were children.

436
00:29:01,316 --> 00:29:03,916
Yes, but with a very long gap in the
middle.

437
00:29:04,516 --> 00:29:06,516
We only met properly a few days ago

438
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:09,636
and now you want to spend the rest of
your life with me?

439
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:12,516
Yes.

440
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:14,556
That's exactly what I want.

441
00:29:15,676 --> 00:29:18,876
I love you, Mary, and there must be
a way to convince you.

442
00:29:21,836 --> 00:29:25,796
Ah, James, could you bring us some
tea?

443
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:28,156
Very good, m'lady.

444
00:29:35,076 --> 00:29:36,876
Look,

445
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:39,956
I never met Matthew but I'm sure he
was a splendid chap.

446
00:29:39,996 --> 00:29:43,476
He was. But he's dead and I'm alive.

447
00:29:45,756 --> 00:29:47,756
We're good together, Mary.

448
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:50,156
We could be so very happy if you'd
let us.

449
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,756
And Miss Lane Fox?

450
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:57,916
I like Mabel... a lot.

451
00:29:58,356 --> 00:30:00,716
I even think that I could come to
love her.

452
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:03,676
But I'm not in love with her as I am
with you.

453
00:30:05,356 --> 00:30:07,356
You fill my brain.

454
00:30:07,396 --> 00:30:09,236
I see you when I close my eyes.

455
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:11,396
I can't stop thinking about you -

456
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,476
where you are, what you're doing.

457
00:30:15,796 --> 00:30:18,836
You're very persuasive. Then be
persuaded.

458
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,956
I only wish I could.

459
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:24,156
Not now, if you don't want to.

460
00:30:25,436 --> 00:30:27,436
You take as long as you need -

461
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:29,876
two years, three.

462
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:34,196
Just so long as I know that you'll
marry me in the end.

463
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:41,036
Tony! Why on earth are you here? Did
you leave something behind?

464
00:30:41,076 --> 00:30:44,316
No, I had some business nearby, so I
thought I'd look in.

465
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,796
Are you staying? Er, yes, if, if you
don't mind.

466
00:30:46,836 --> 00:30:49,356
I brought a bag on the off chance.
And your man?

467
00:30:49,836 --> 00:30:52,516
I didn't want to make a fuss. It's
only one night.

468
00:30:55,476 --> 00:30:58,756
I can't stay much longer. Nanny's
bringing down Sybbie in a moment.

469
00:30:58,796 --> 00:31:00,876
It won't take long. She's coming
now.

470
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:09,796
I see.

471
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,836
What do you see?

472
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:13,876
Well, I know now why you sent for
me.

473
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:17,516
You're going to gang up on me and
try to pay me off.

474
00:31:18,396 --> 00:31:20,396
Why would we pay you off?

475
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,716
Well, if I'm pregnant.

476
00:31:25,796 --> 00:31:29,476
I want my baby to have a father and
I won't change my mind about that,

477
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:31,676
however much you offer.

478
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:33,716
I wasn't planning to make an offer.

479
00:31:34,276 --> 00:31:36,276
Because there is no child.

480
00:31:36,636 --> 00:31:38,636
What? You can't know that.

481
00:31:38,956 --> 00:31:41,596
Nobody can. But I do know that,
actually.

482
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:44,316
Edna's not pregnant.

483
00:31:44,356 --> 00:31:48,436
Do you think she would have let herself
get pregnant before she was sure of you?

484
00:31:48,836 --> 00:31:50,836
And she knew how to prevent it.

485
00:31:51,796 --> 00:31:55,036
Why else would you buy this book of
instructions?

486
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,436
Marie Stopes. Married Love.

487
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:01,596
Though in your case it was unmarried
love, wasn't it, dear?

488
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:05,876
You've been through my things. What if I'd
agreed to marry her and there was no baby?

489
00:32:05,916 --> 00:32:08,516
Once you'd agreed she would have got
pregnant.

490
00:32:09,036 --> 00:32:12,636
I don't know whom she would have
selected as the father,

491
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:14,876
but no doubt she had a candidate in
mind.

492
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:19,476
What proof have you got? Oh, none at
the moment.

493
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,916
But if you persist in your lie

494
00:32:21,956 --> 00:32:24,636
I'll summon the doctor and have him
examine you.

495
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:27,756
You can't force me. Oh, yes, I can.

496
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:30,916
I'll lock you in this room and when
he's arrived

497
00:32:30,956 --> 00:32:34,196
I'll tear off your clothes and hold
you down, if that's what it takes.

498
00:32:36,396 --> 00:32:38,956
You can't stop me from speaking to
her ladyship.

499
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,916
No, you're right.

500
00:32:42,356 --> 00:32:44,356
That I cannot do.

501
00:32:44,956 --> 00:32:46,956
But if you want a reference...

502
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:51,836
or another job during your natural
lifetime, you'll hold your tongue.

503
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:55,756
This is yours, I think.

504
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,796
But even with the book, how did you
know she wasn't pregnant?

505
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:08,676
I didn't. And the doctor couldn't
have told a thing yet, either.

506
00:33:09,676 --> 00:33:11,676
But at least we know the truth now.

507
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:18,356
What's the matter with you? Never
mind.

508
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,116
I thought we were all about to be
dancing to your tune.

509
00:33:21,156 --> 00:33:24,196
Do you ever wonder why people
dislike you so much?

510
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,796
It's because you are sly and oily
and smug.

511
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:31,916
And I'm really pleased I got the
chance to tell you before I go.

512
00:33:31,956 --> 00:33:34,076
Well, if we're playing the truth
game,

513
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,796
then you're a manipulative little
witch,

514
00:33:36,836 --> 00:33:39,716
and if your schemes have come to
nothing, I'm delighted.

515
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:44,236
Are you leaving Downton then? What's
it to you?

516
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:46,516
Oh, plenty.

517
00:33:46,556 --> 00:33:48,556
It's plenty to me.

518
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:57,556
You won't believe what's happened.

519
00:33:57,596 --> 00:34:00,516
Braithwaite's handed in her notice.
What? Why?

520
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:02,796
Family troubles. Or so she says.

521
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:07,676
Are we living under a curse, doomed to
lose our lady's maids at regular intervals?

522
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:09,716
Anna, did you know about this?

523
00:34:11,556 --> 00:34:13,556
Is anything the matter?

524
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:17,076
No, m'lord. You seem very quiet
lately.

525
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:19,116
I hope Bates is behaving himself.

526
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:21,836
He never does anything else.

527
00:34:22,956 --> 00:34:25,356
Will that be all, m'lady? Yes, thank
you.

528
00:34:26,036 --> 00:34:30,036
Did they tell you Tony Gillingham's
asked himself for the night? They have.

529
00:34:31,276 --> 00:34:33,396
We must try not to read too much
into it.

530
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:36,716
Why are you in your rompers?

531
00:34:36,756 --> 00:34:38,836
Tony only brought black tie.

532
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,756
He didn't think we'd be changing if
no-one was staying.

533
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:44,396
So another brick is pulled from the
wall.

534
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:48,236
Why is Lord Gillingham back so soon?

535
00:34:48,276 --> 00:34:50,716
That's the big question. But we're
very glad he is.

536
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:53,636
Not all of us, I imagine.

537
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:58,156
Are you ready to go? Carson says the
car's outside. Oh, yes, I think so.

538
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:02,196
So, you're off in the morning? I am.
Pity we didn't get Edith to wait a day.

539
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:04,236
Why did she go to London, anyway?

540
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:06,756
I asked but she assumed an air of
mystery.

541
00:35:06,796 --> 00:35:09,996
Honestly, Papa. Edith's about as
mysterious as a bucket.

542
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,836
She's gone to see Michael Gregson.

543
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:15,556
Ooh, that's the next thing to look
forward to. I don't dislike him.

544
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:17,916
Oh, what a recommendation.

545
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:20,476
Goodnight, dear. Goodnight, Granny.

546
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:24,636
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.
Goodnight. Goodnight, Isobel.
Goodnight.

547
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:29,196
Goodnight, Lord Gillingham.

548
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:32,836
I hope we see you up here again
before too long. I hope so, too.

549
00:35:37,356 --> 00:35:39,796
That was nobly done. Mm-hm.

550
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,836
She is a good woman

551
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:44,756
and, while the phrase is enough to
set one's teeth on edge,

552
00:35:44,796 --> 00:35:48,676
there are moments when her virtue
demands admiration.

553
00:35:48,956 --> 00:35:52,396
I agree, although I'm rather
surprised to hear you say it.

554
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:54,876
Not as surprised as I am.

555
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,356
Ah, Monk's left the coffee.

556
00:36:00,396 --> 00:36:02,396
He's cleared off till the morning.

557
00:36:02,436 --> 00:36:06,316
Does that mean we have to do the
washing up? No, he'll do that tomorrow.

558
00:36:06,996 --> 00:36:09,796
He comes back at eight. That's quite
a discipline.

559
00:36:10,316 --> 00:36:12,196
Why do you say that?

560
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,636
It reminds me of Lady Warwick

561
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,996
having the stable bell at Easton
rung at six,

562
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:21,356
so everyone had to time to get to the right
beds before the maids and valets arrived.

563
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:24,076
Isn't that apocryphal? No, actually.

564
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,516
Papa and Mama stayed there once and
said it was quite true.

565
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:31,356
Of course they already were in the
right bed.

566
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:36,036
I don't know why I said all that. I
hope I do.

567
00:36:37,516 --> 00:36:39,516
Don't be silly.

568
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:41,716
Will you miss me? Of course.

569
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:46,156
Is it really only a week until you
leave? Mm.

570
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,796
Is there anything I can do to keep
things running whilst you're in Munich?

571
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:54,316
Well, as a matter of fact I've got
something I want you to sign.

572
00:36:54,876 --> 00:36:57,836
It will give you some authority over
my affairs.

573
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:59,876
Come here.

574
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:10,356
What'll you do when you get there?

575
00:37:11,036 --> 00:37:12,956
Well, I thought I'd write a novel.

576
00:37:12,996 --> 00:37:16,476
Or try to. I always fancied myself a
novelist and never had the time.

577
00:37:16,516 --> 00:37:18,516
Now I've got nothing but.

578
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:20,836
How long is it going to take? I'm
not sure.

579
00:37:22,076 --> 00:37:24,356
I'll set the wheels in motion when I
arrive

580
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:26,716
and we'll stop when and if we hit a
rock.

581
00:37:26,756 --> 00:37:28,876
But the lawyers are quite
optimistic.

582
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,236
I thought lawyers were never
optimistic.

583
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:33,276
That's why it's a good sign.

584
00:37:35,196 --> 00:37:37,196
Are we going out tonight?

585
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:40,596
Rose was talking about the new band
at the Lotus Club.

586
00:37:40,636 --> 00:37:44,036
Hm. Well, no, I hadn't planned on
going anywhere.

587
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:46,836
No?

588
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:48,756
No.

589
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:58,396
Michael, I... Oh, my darling.

590
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:19,258
So I can move back in? Edna's room
will be empty now

591
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:23,098
and if I'm to dress her ladyship and
Lady Mary, I think it makes sense.

592
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:28,458
If that's what you really want.

593
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:35,978
I'm sorry it didn't work out with
Miss Braithwaite.

594
00:38:36,018 --> 00:38:38,258
Not that I care much for her.

595
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:41,018
I'm sorry about the disruption for
her ladyship.

596
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:45,138
One day I'll tell you the whole
story. Then you'll be less sorry.

597
00:38:46,178 --> 00:38:49,978
The truth is we were mad as hatters
to let her back in the house.

598
00:38:52,938 --> 00:38:54,938
I've got a present for you.

599
00:38:59,498 --> 00:39:01,498
It's for your desk.

600
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:05,658
What made you think of that?

601
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:09,298
It's good for you to be reminded you
once had a heart.

602
00:39:09,618 --> 00:39:12,978
And it'll reassure the staff to know
you belong to the human race.

603
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:16,618
This frame looks expensive.

604
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:21,058
She was pretty though, wasn't she?

605
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,618
She was. Very pretty.

606
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:26,058
And I'm sure she was very nice.

607
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,818
And now you can look at that and
remember her.

608
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:34,018
You're right, Mrs Hughes. I will.

609
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,956
The business of life is the
acquisition of memories.

610
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:41,196
In the end that's all there is.

611
00:39:42,996 --> 00:39:44,996
Thank you.

612
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:52,916
Bates, do you know anything about
why Braithwaite left?

613
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,956
I don't, m'lord.

614
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,116
They say she had some troubles at
home.

615
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,596
I hope it's not too much for Anna.

616
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,436
Bates?

617
00:40:07,596 --> 00:40:10,436
She wants to move back into the
house, m'lord.

618
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:15,036
She says she needs to if she is to
perform her duties properly.

619
00:40:15,836 --> 00:40:17,836
Is something wrong between you?

620
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:22,156
Yes.

621
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:25,396
But I don't know what it is.

622
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:28,676
She says it's nothing I've done but
I can't believe that.

623
00:40:28,716 --> 00:40:31,516
It must be my fault because she is
incapable of fault.

624
00:40:34,196 --> 00:40:36,196
I don't know what to do.

625
00:40:36,236 --> 00:40:39,956
There is no such thing as a marriage
between two intelligent people

626
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,996
that does not sometimes have to
negotiate thin ice.

627
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,036
I know.

628
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:47,156
You must wait until things become
clear.

629
00:40:47,196 --> 00:40:49,196
And they will.

630
00:40:49,836 --> 00:40:51,716
The damage cannot be irreparable

631
00:40:51,756 --> 00:40:54,476
when a man and a woman love each
other as much as you do.

632
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,676
My goodness, that was strong talk
for an Englishman.

633
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:22,476
I don't really want to go back
to London,

634
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:24,516
but I suppose I have to. Hm.

635
00:41:25,676 --> 00:41:27,876
That's after I get your answer, that
is.

636
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:31,236
I was wondering how long it would
take you to get to the point.

637
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:34,836
Are you ready?

638
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,916
What happens if I refuse?

639
00:41:38,436 --> 00:41:40,436
We both know I must marry.

640
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:44,196
I don't need to explain to you how
the system we're trapped in works.

641
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:46,716
Please, don't rush into anything.

642
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,636
I won't make a fool of Mabel. It
wouldn't be fair.

643
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,996
I'd break up with her for you and I will
credit her by saying that she'd understand.

644
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:59,436
She sounds rather fine.

645
00:42:02,316 --> 00:42:04,316
If you don't want me then...

646
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:07,356
I think I'm honour-bound to go
through with it.

647
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:18,756
It's no good, Tony.

648
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:21,716
I can't.

649
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,156
I'm not free of him.

650
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:28,636
Yesterday you said I fill your
brain.

651
00:42:29,596 --> 00:42:33,196
Well, Matthew fills mine.

652
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:36,076
Still.

653
00:42:37,436 --> 00:42:39,436
And I don't want to be without him.

654
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,516
Not yet.

655
00:42:55,276 --> 00:42:57,276
Can I ask one favour?

656
00:42:59,316 --> 00:43:01,916
And then I really will go and leave
you in peace.

657
00:43:03,036 --> 00:43:05,876
What is it? Will you kiss me?

658
00:43:08,596 --> 00:43:10,196
Please.

659
00:43:10,596 --> 00:43:13,396
I will never love again as I love
you in this moment.

660
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,796
And I must have something to
remember.

661
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:42,556
Goodbye, Mary.

662
00:43:43,396 --> 00:43:45,396
My darling Mary.

663
00:43:46,396 --> 00:43:49,116
My prayers go with you for
everything that you do.

664
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:04,956
May I have a word, your lordship?
Hm.

665
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:07,076
If Miss Braithwaite is not coming
back,

666
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:10,316
I wondered if her replacement had
been decided on. Not yet.

667
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:15,236
I have a candidate I'd like to put forward who I
know very well and is more than qualified.

668
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:18,356
You must discuss it with her
ladyship but I've no objection.

669
00:44:18,396 --> 00:44:21,796
She's a little older than Miss
Braithwaite. That won't hurt.

670
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:24,676
Why do you say that? No reason.

671
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:29,036
Where's Tony? Has he gone? He
thought he'd said all his goodbyes

672
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,436
and he wanted to catch the half past
nine.

673
00:44:31,476 --> 00:44:33,796
Are you ready? Where are you going?

674
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:36,716
York. For estimates to re-equip the
saw mill.

675
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:39,916
So, will we be seeing Tony
Gillingham again?

676
00:44:40,716 --> 00:44:42,716
I'm sure we will... eventually.

677
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,876
He was telling me about Mabel Lane
Fox.

678
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:49,116
Apparently, they're getting engaged.

679
00:44:49,636 --> 00:44:51,956
I imagine he'll be very taken up
with that.

680
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:54,676
Yes, I dare say.

681
00:44:55,476 --> 00:44:57,476
Right, I'll get my hat.

682
00:45:05,876 --> 00:45:07,716
There you are.

683
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:09,516
Well, you don't look too bad.

684
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:12,276
I thought you might be a little the
worse for wear.

685
00:45:12,316 --> 00:45:15,356
Why should I be? After only two
hours' sleep.

686
00:45:16,356 --> 00:45:21,436
My maid saw you come in. Aren't you
going to tell me what kept you out
until six in the morning?

687
00:45:22,516 --> 00:45:24,516
Well, we...

688
00:45:25,036 --> 00:45:28,316
Please don't say you were talking
and you lost track of time.

689
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:31,716
Quite apart from the morality - or
lack of it in this situation -

690
00:45:31,756 --> 00:45:34,076
you do realise you are taking a
great risk?

691
00:45:34,876 --> 00:45:38,556
You're trusting this man with your
name and your reputation.

692
00:45:39,756 --> 00:45:42,076
He wants to marry me. Of course I
trust him.

693
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:44,196
As you trusted Sir Anthony Strallan?

694
00:45:46,756 --> 00:45:48,836
That was rather unkind.

695
00:45:51,796 --> 00:45:53,796
Are you going to tell Mama?

696
00:45:54,876 --> 00:45:56,836
No.

697
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:59,836
You're a grown woman and I'm not a
spy.

698
00:46:01,196 --> 00:46:03,796
But you're gambling with your
future, my dear.

699
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:05,916
Be under no illusions.

700
00:46:05,956 --> 00:46:10,076
A lot may be changing, but some
things will stay the same.

701
00:46:11,556 --> 00:46:14,236
I'm not a bit sorry. No, you don't
look sorry.

702
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:18,516
But you may find yourself feeling
very sorry later.

703
00:46:29,916 --> 00:46:32,796
You seem more cheerful than you were
in London. I am.

704
00:46:33,236 --> 00:46:36,316
I took your advice. I talked it over
and I'm off the hook.

705
00:46:37,276 --> 00:46:39,276
So whatever it was, it's gone away?

706
00:46:39,316 --> 00:46:41,396
I think so.

707
00:46:41,436 --> 00:46:43,436
I envy you.

708
00:46:43,476 --> 00:46:44,996
Why?

709
00:46:45,036 --> 00:46:48,956
Because I've just done something which
I have a sneaking fear I may regret...

710
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,516
for a long time to come.

711
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:10,956
My life is perfect and then, in the
space of one day, it is nothing.

712
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:13,036
Good morning, Miss Baxter. Hello, Mr
Bates.

713
00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:15,076
What do you make of her? She's nice.

714
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:18,716
How are you getting on with her
ladyship? That is so considerate.

715
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:21,476
She'll be eating out of your hand.
That's the intention.

716
00:47:21,516 --> 00:47:25,076
You owe your place to Mrs Crawley.
She would not let me go until I'd promised.

717
00:47:25,116 --> 00:47:28,996
You make me sound very fervent. Wars
have been waged with less fervour.

718
00:47:29,036 --> 00:47:32,116
His forebears have been tenants
since the reign of George III.

719
00:47:32,156 --> 00:47:34,556
Be that as it may the rent's not
been paid for ages.

720
00:47:34,596 --> 00:47:37,737
We gave your father a long time. You
want to farm the land yourself.

721
00:47:37,801 --> 00:48:11,840

1
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Housekeeper used to be Mrs Hughes.
I don't know if she's still here.

2
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,080
Leave everything to me, m'lord.
See you upstairs. I won't be up
before the gong.

3
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,220
Can I help?
Stick it under my arm if you can.

4
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,000
You're an angel.
I don't know about that.

5
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,100
Do you know where Lord Gillingham's
room is? The maid will show you.

6
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,240
You've got the answer to everything.
I suspect you have too,
Mr Gillingham.

7
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,100
Was the train on time, Sir John?
It was all as efficient as you like.

8
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Mrs Jefferson, how nice to see you!

9
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,060
Which one's Mr Sampson
and why have we asked him?

10
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,180
Ah well, I see him at White's every
now and then and he seemed keen to
come.

11
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,100
He's over there, talking to Mama.
Ah yes.

12
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,140
Who's the glamorous pirate?

13
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,100
Don't you recognise
Johnnie Gillingham's son?

14
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,060
Anthony Foyle?
Yes but he's Lord Gillingham now.

15
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,980
I haven't seen him
since his father's funeral.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,140
I know, but I wrote afterwards
and he answered.

17
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,240
Well.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,100
How nice of you to come.
It's good to be back at Downton.

19
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,100
Mary, you remember Anthony Foyle?
Sorry, Gillingham.

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,100
I remember
a very superior young man

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,220
who found three little girls
extremely tiresome to deal with.

22
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,200
I seem to be outnumbered
by your parents' old friends.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,100
Don't worry. You and Papa are
going to get to know each other
this time. I promise.

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,140
You're the agent here now,
aren't you? Mary told me.

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,020
You must miss darling Sybil
so dreadfully.

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,240
Yes. Did you have a good journey?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,040
I'm afraid Tom's
small talk is very small indeed.

28
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,080
Not everyone can be Oscar Wilde.
That's a relief.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,000
Go up when you like. We'll gather
in the drawing room at eight.

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,020
Ten staying and only three
maids and two valets between them.

31
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,140
Not quite like before the war,
is it? Very little is.

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,020
They're mostly easy and the Duchess
of Yeovil's no trouble at all.

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,180
We don't know Mr Sampson
or Sir John Bullock

34
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,100
and we haven't seen
Lord Gillingham for a while.

35
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,220
Oh, Anna,
can you look in on Mrs Jefferson?

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,120
They're in the Chinese.

37
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,160
Of course.

38
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,180
Oh, Edna, Lady Raven might need
a helping hand. She's in Fontenoy.

39
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,240
She says she's used to having
no maid but I rather doubt it.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm not sure I've got time.
Make time!

41
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,220
Poor Lady Raven.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,140
When you think of her life
ten years ago and now.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,120
I'm told she has some dingy
little house north of the park.

44
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,200
It's a wonder they still ask her
to stay.

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,020
Well, perhaps her ladyship
does not wish

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,140
to cast away an old friend
because she lives north of the park.

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,180
I know, I know. But still, it's sad.

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,200
We never moved back after the war.
It was a hospital, you know.

49
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,000
And now?
It's a girls' school.

50
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,060
Hmm. But we're quite
comfortable in the Dower House.

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,200
Did you ever see it?

52
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,180
I remember having tea there
with your grandmother.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,100
She gave me ice cream
and I got it all over my dress.

54
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,020
Nanny was furious.

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,200
That sounds like Grandmama.

56
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,220
She'd always say how children
should be spoiled.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,060
She's gone now, so she'll never know
if I took her advice.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,060
You have no children?
No.

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,020
No children, no wife.

60
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,020
I've come close a couple of times.
In fact, I'm close now.

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
What about you?

62
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,160
I have a son, George.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,180
You know that Matthew...

64
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,100
Oh God, I'm... I'm sorry.

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,100
Of course I know.
I just wasn't thinking.

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,060
Please forgive me.

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,060
There's nothing to forgive.

68
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,200
I go this way and you're down there.

69
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Oh, not those bowls, Ivy!

70
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,080
Chilled soup should be an exquisite
mouthful, not a bucket of slop!

71
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,200
I'll get the smaller ones.
How are the squabs doing?

72
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,020
Fine, Mrs Patmore.
What about the syllabubs?

73
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,060
The orange peel and brandy is in the
larder. I'll whip the cream during
the first course.

74
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,240
What about the savoury?
Mushrooms peeled and cut.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,060
Butter's ready. I'll make
the toast when they eat the pudding.

76
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh my God, the vegetables!

77
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,160
She'll bust a gut
if she keeps that up.

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,180
Have you settled him in,
Mr Gillingham?

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,020
I wish you could call me Green.
My real name.

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,060
Mr Carson wouldn't approve.
He believes in the old ways.

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,180
What do you believe in?

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,220
I believe in getting on
with my work.

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,060
All work and no play makes Jack
a dull boy and Jill a dull girl.

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,220
I should organise some games.

85
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,080
I'll organise you
if you don't watch out!

86
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,100
They finally got you
into white tie, I see.

87
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
More's the pity. I've never felt
more stupid in my life.

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
I was wondering why we've never
spoken since I came back.

89
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,100
I hope we can still be friends?

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,080
Of course. Of course we can.

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,040
But we can't have lunch again
at the pub in the village.

92
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,180
Braithwaite...

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Edna.

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,180
I'm trying to walk
a tightrope here...

95
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,140
As long as you're not my enemy.

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
God, no.

97
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,160
I hope things turn out well for you.
I do, truly.

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:34,060
I gather the abbey is once more
to be a scene of great splendour.

99
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Are you going up there
for any of it?

100
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,200
I'm supposed to go for dinner
on the last night. To hear Melba
sing.

101
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh. I envy you.
But you don't sound very glad.

102
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,200
I don't want them to spend their
days in Stygian gloom, I really
don't.

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,140
They say life must go on
and of course it must.

104
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,140
But it seems disloyal to Matthew.

105
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,040
Not disloyal, exactly.

106
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,220
What does Lady Mary feel?
Oh, you know Mary.

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,180
She's always quite opaque.

108
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,220
I love Al Jolson, don't you?
I've got all his records.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,060
Including April Showers?
Of course. I love it madly.

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you ever in London?
I might be.

111
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,100
We're a little exposed up here
to sow barley as a winter crop.

112
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,040
The Duke always swore by it.

113
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,180
Did you know barley beer was
probably the first alcoholic drink?

114
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,100
It was developed by Neolithic man.

115
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,200
So we all owe him quite a debt.
Do we?

116
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:40,140
Oh, there's poor Lady Raven. I
really ought to go and talk to her.

117
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,020
Of course, Your Grace.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,220
Don't call her Your Grace.
I thought it was correct.

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,140
For a servant,
or an official at a ceremony,

120
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,000
but in a social situation,
call her Duchess.

121
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,020
But why? I don't call you Countess.

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,220
Certainly not!
There's no logic in it.

123
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,080
Oh no,
if I were to search for logic,

124
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,060
I should not look for it
among the English upper class.

125
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,040
Thomas, get me a drink will you,
for God's sake. It's Barrow now,
sir. But yes, of course.

126
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,080
What about a hand at cards?
Why not?

127
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,060
I'll get them to set up a table
for you in the smoking room. Barrow?

128
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,220
Er, already done, m'lord.

129
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,100
Will you play, Lord Grantham?
I don't think so. Not tonight.

130
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,060
Do you ever play?
Well, I used to.

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,020
Tonight I'd rather be with you.

132
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,120
It's no trouble. We have plenty of
horses and Papa would be delighted.

133
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,240
Have you anything to ride in?
We packed it all in case.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,100
Well, that settles it. I'll send
a message to the stables tonight.

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,080
Will you come out with me?

136
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,140
Actually I might. I haven't
been in the saddle for ages.

137
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll be as stiff as a board
the next day.

138
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,060
Would anyone else
like to go riding tomorrow morning?

139
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,140
Sir John? Mr Sampson?

140
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,980
Must I?

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,220
Edith?

142
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,080
Do you ride?
Not if I don't have to.

143
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

144
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,100
Why on earth are you doing that
at this ungodly hour?

145
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,140
Where are the girls?
I sent them to bed.

146
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,100
I thought I might get ahead
of myself. I might lay out what I
need for the breakfast.

147
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,020
All set for tomorrow?
I think so.

148
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,100
Where should we feed Dame Nellie
on Sunday? She can't eat in the
servants' hall.

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,020
And what about the pianist?

150
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,180
Well, he can join us
and she can have a tray in her room.

151
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,100
You don't think she should dine
with the house party?

152
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
An Australian singer?

153
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,120
Eating with her ladyship?

154
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,080
Never mind the Duchess!
No, I do not!

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,200
Mr Molesley?
Hello.

156
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,140
What are you doing? Mrs Patmore left
an order with Mr Bakewell. She said
it was urgent.

157
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,180
What's this, Mr Molesley?
Are you delivering for Bakewell's?

158
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm just filling in.
Until something turns up.

159
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,060
You're a delivery boy? Now, now,
Daisy. There's no shame in hard
work.

160
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,080
You sit there, Mr Molesley,
and I'll fetch you some tea.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,220
You played late. I hope you didn't
think me rude for going to bed.

162
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,200
No. Not a bit.
How was the game?

163
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,120
Sampson is a very skilled player.

164
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,060
Where were you last night?
Being thrashed by Sampson.

165
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,060
Poor you!

166
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,240
I hope that means
I can count on you tonight.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,160
You can always count on me.

168
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,100
What are your plans for today?

169
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,160
I'll go to the wood,
look at the new planting.

170
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,220
Won't you help me
entertain our guests?

171
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,160
Just give me two hours off
and I'll do whatever you want.

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,060
We're going for a walk
after breakfast. Why don't you come?

173
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,060
I don't think so. I've got too much
to do, rounding this lot up.

174
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,180
Coffee?

175
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,080
Not yet, thank you.

176
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm going to manage it somehow.

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,060
I've a feeling he's good at putting
off what he doesn't want to do.

178
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,060
He's not as calculated as that.

179
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,160
How little we know our own parents.

180
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,180
Apparently he took a fortune
off Sir John Bullock.

181
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,020
What about your employer? His
lordship's too clever. He got out
the game early.

182
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,220
That's not what I heard.
What were they playing?

183
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,980
Poker.
Of course it was poker.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,080
You can't lose a fortune
playing snap. I could!

185
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,020
Mabel Lane Fox? So you've caught
the greatest heiress of the season.

186
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,180
She's very nice, in fact.
I'm sure.

187
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,060
Of course, everyone wants it,
on both sides, but we do get on.

188
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,200
You may be surprised to hear that a
match wanted by everyone can turn
out to be extremely happy.

189
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,240
Do you speak from experience?
Absolutely.

190
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,980
Matthew and I were flung at each
other's heads from the moment
he arrived.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,120
If anything,
it rather slowed matters up.

192
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,180
But you were happy?

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Wonderfully happy.

194
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,220
How lucky you are.

195
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,180
Am I?

196
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,180
You've known a great love.

197
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Doesn't that enrich any life?

198
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm not sure. Matthew changed me.

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,080
I loved him but he changed me.

200
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,200
If I were as tough as I was before
I met him, I bet I'd be happier now.

201
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,120
Maybe.

202
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,200
But we can't go back, can we?

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Apparently not.

204
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,240
What will you do with that?

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,020
Cover it and dry it on the stove,
then put it into muslin bags.

206
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,100
Lady Gillingham's maid
buys it in packets.

207
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,000
Perhaps she's not a country girl.
Judging by you, she's the poorer
for that.

208
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,160
You've plenty of time for chatter.
You can blame me.

209
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,140
I'm afraid it's a failing of mine.
I do blame you.

210
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,140
What is the matter?

211
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't know. There's something
about him that gets my goat.

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,080
He was just trying to be nice.

213
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,140
Carson. We're all going on a tour
of the gardens in ten minutes.

214
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,180
When we get back, it might
be nice to have some coffee.
Very well, m'lady.

215
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Is everything under control?
It is.

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,240
It's exciting to think
of Nellie Melba singing at Downton.

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm not sure about exciting.
It's certainly expensive.

218
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,040
A house party can be so flat
if there's no special moment.

219
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,140
And it wouldn't be special enough
to watch the sun set by the lake?

220
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,120
Good morning, ladies.
Good morning.

221
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,180
What is it?
I can't get the lid off this.

222
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,020
Give it here.

223
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,020
I'll do it.

224
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,220
Stand back.
Let a real man handle it.

225
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,060
Come on.

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,020
I wonder
what happened to that real man?

227
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,000
See? Told you I was master here.

228
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,240
That'll teach you to show off!

229
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I hurt myself, thank you!
You'll mend which is more than I can
say for that jar.

230
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,000
Daisy, Ivy, clear this mess up.
As I assume Mr Clever Clogs won't.

231
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,060
I'm getting quite fluent.

232
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,160
You're taking German lessons?
If I'm going to live there.

233
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,020
No, no. Of course.

234
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
I just can't get over the fact
you're doing all this to be with me.

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Whatever it takes.

236
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,240
Michael was admiring the library.
It's marvellous.

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,140
Edith tells me
there's a Gutenberg Bible.

238
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,020
Yes. It's a shame our librarian,
Mr Pattinson, isn't here.

239
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,240
He's the only one
who knows where anything is.

240
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,160
If you'll excuse me? I must go
and sort out the wine for tonight.

241
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,100
He doesn't approve of me.

242
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,000
He doesn't know you.
Nor is he likely to.

243
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,200
Serve the Margaux at dinner and keep
the Haut-Brion for tomorrow.

244
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,000
No the '99, if we have enough.
I want to go out with a bang.

245
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,180
And you can choose the white.
Very good, m'lord.

246
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:00,140
Her ladyship has been kind enough
to invite the servants to hear
Dame Nellie tomorrow evening.

247
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,180
It's a rare opportunity for them.
She's very generous.

248
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,180
But I wondered, what are
we to do about the kitchen staff?

249
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,140
Why? Do you fear the corrupting
influence of opera? Not at all,
m'lord.

250
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,180
But before the war they wouldn't
usually have been included. I think
we must bend that far, Carson.

251
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,180
Modern times and all that.
As you wish, m'lord.

252
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I've arranged for Dame Nellie's
accompanist to sleep with the male
servants.

253
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,140
I doubt he'd expect to sleep
with the female ones!

254
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,140
And Dame Nellie will have
dinner in her room. Very good.

255
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,000
Whatever you think.

256
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,060
How wonderful to see an estate
that's still all in one piece.

257
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,040
Don't speak too soon.
What do you mean?

258
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,040
Well, we have a big tax bill to pay.

259
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,980
Papa wants to sell land but
I'd like to see if we can avoid it.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,140
The trouble is,
I can't get him to listen.

261
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,020
Shall I tell you what I'd do?
Please.

262
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,100
Make him agree for you to meet
the tax people

263
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,080
then bring back the best deal
they can offer.

264
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,020
In that way
you'll have a real case to argue.

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,160
We had a similar choice
when Father died.

266
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,160
In the end,
we let the house but kept the land.

267
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,160
Thank you.

268
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,180
It's nice to know one's not alone.

269
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,020
That others
are facing the same trials.

270
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,000
No.

271
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,080
You're not alone.

272
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Argh! What's up?
I've jiggered my bloody wrist!

273
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,200
I'll have no swear words
in here, thank you very much.

274
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,080
Unless I'm doing the swearing.
What's going on?

275
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,180
Why aren't you upstairs?
Jimmy hurt his wrist.

276
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
He can't carry the tray.
What?

277
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,160
I'll do my best, Mr Carson.
Is something wrong?

278
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,060
Why are you down here?
Who's in the dining room?

279
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,980
I'm going back up.
I wondered what the delay was.

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,100
Oh no, that's no good.
Mr Barrow, you'll have to do it.

281
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,180
Mr Carson, must I remind you
that I am the under butler?

282
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,160
I don't care if you're the high
cockalorum. You're a footman
tonight.

283
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,120
Sorry, Mr Barrow.

284
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,140
It wasn't her husband,
it was a dog!

285
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,060
I'm getting up a game.
What about you, Gillingham?

286
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,100
I don't think so.
I'll join you if you like.

287
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,060
Is there a place for me?
Certainly.

288
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,100
Shall we meet in the smoking room
in ten minutes? Very good.

289
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,140
Be careful if I were you.
Sampson is a very sharp player.

290
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,060
I think I can look after myself.

291
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,200
It looks terribly heavy.

292
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm playing cards with your father.
He'll have to talk to me if we're
at a card table.

293
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,040
I hope James isn't really hurt.
I don't think so, m'lady. Good.

294
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,100
We'll have to muddle
through tomorrow as well.

295
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,240
Don't worry about that, m'lady.
I have an idea.

296
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,060
You do realise we can sell land as
a capital gain and pay no tax on it
at all?

297
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,080
And end up with an estate
that can't support the house.

298
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,240
I doubt it will change my mind.
I'm glad you only doubt it.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,080
I must be making some progress.

300
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,160
What's that?

301
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,180
Is there anyone who wants to dance?

302
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,060
I jolly well do. If it's with you.

303
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,120
I love dancing but these days
I haven't got a partner.

304
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,080
Tom? You're dressed for it.

305
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,180
Would you care to dance with me,
Duchess? I should love it.

306
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,220
I hate to pass up a chance
to hold you in my arms...

307
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
Why do you have to play?
Because I've said I will.

308
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,200
What about it?

309
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,160
I thought I'd keep Granny company.

310
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,080
Don't use me as an excuse. If you
don't want to dance, tell him.

311
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,020
Do you know Racing Demon? I've heard
of it but I've never played.

312
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,020
I'll teach you.
We'll bring in some of the others.

313
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,060
You need a pack of cards for every
player. We can manage that.

314
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,000
Anna, can you give me a hand with
this shirt? I've got shoes to clean.

315
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,080
Of course.

316
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,060
I'm very fond of Ireland.
Where did you grow up?

317
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,160
Bray, in County Wicklow.

318
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:50,080
Oh, I love Wicklow! Of course,
you must know the Powerscourts.

319
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,040
I know of Lord Powerscourt, yes.

320
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,060
Lady Powerscourt is my niece.
Have you met her?

321
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,060
I've seen her. I wouldn't say
exactly I've met her.

322
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,080
I don't know why I'm doing this.

323
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,200
By the way, I took your advice
and I'm pleased I did. Thank you.

324
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,120
Glad to be of service.

325
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Rose?

326
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,040
Where did you get that?
I found it in the attic.

327
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,080
I got Alfred to bring it downstairs.

328
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,140
I'm so sorry but I...
I can't dance after all.

329
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,100
What was that about?

330
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,100
The gramophone.

331
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,080
It belonged to Matthew.
I didn't think.

332
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,240
What a pity.

333
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,140
Four nines.

334
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,080
You're too good for me.
He's too good for all of us.

335
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,020
Nonsense.
I've been lucky, that's all.

336
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm wondering if I ought to stop.
I'm in pretty deep. I'm in deeper
I'm sad to say.

337
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
Your luck is about to change,
gentlemen. I'm certain of it.

338
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,160
If it doesn't,
how do you like to be paid?

339
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,060
Don't worry. I'm happy with IOUs.
We can settle up when we leave
or at the club.

340
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,240
Besides, you may have won
it all back by the end.

341
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
Not a chance.
I hope you can all keep my secret?

342
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,020
I wouldn't want to worry
Lady Grantham.

343
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,200
We must practise our poker face.
Antes, gentlemen.

344
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,040
Good night.

345
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,020
How are you enjoying the party?

346
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I look like a fool.

347
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,220
I talk like a fool. I am a fool.

348
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,980
Alfred said you were dancing.

349
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,020
With an old bat
who could be my granny

350
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,200
and thinks I grew up in a cave.

351
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,100
My clothes deceive no one.

352
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,100
Don't be so hard on yourself.

353
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm a fish out of water and
I've never felt it more than today.

354
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,060
Good day, m'lord?
Good until tonight.

355
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,100
I took a walloping from Mr Sampson.
At poker.

356
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,020
I was a fool to play with someone
who so obviously knew what he was
doing.

357
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,980
Lord Gillingham tried to warn me
but I wouldn't listen.

358
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,200
Do you know the gentleman well?
No.

359
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,140
But I was discussing the party
at the club

360
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,240
and he hinted a bit
and I suppose I took the bait.

361
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,240
Anyway.

362
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,100
Perhaps keep it to yourself, Bates.

363
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,040
Of course, m'lord.

364
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,120
Good man.

365
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,200
M'lady? What's the matter?

366
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,220
Did you know that Lady Rose
had found Mr Crawley's gramophone?

367
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,180
I did, yes.
She wanted it for her records.

368
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,120
I told her to ask you.
Well, she didn't.

369
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,240
I feel very sad tonight.
And no wonder.

370
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,080
She shouldn't have had it brought
down and set off your memories.

371
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,080
No, it's not that.

372
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,000
At least, it's not only that.

373
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,200
Sometimes I don't know
whom I'm most in mourning for.

374
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,040
Matthew or the person I used to be
when I was with him.

375
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,220
You're a fine person, m'lady.

376
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,160
Fine and strong. And you'll learn
that for yourself as time goes by.

377
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,220
I made rather an idiot of myself
in front of Lord Gillingham.

378
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
He won't mind.

379
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,020
No.

380
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,080
No, I don't think he will.

381
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,180
Can you stop a moment, please,
and let me out?

382
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,280
Isobel! Isobel, my dear.

383
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,080
Will you come up tonight
and hear Melba?

384
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,200
Well, I can't decide.
I... I have a lot to do.

385
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,160
Look, my dear,
I don't want to be unkind,

386
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,260
and you have my sympathy, truly.

387
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,100
But it won't bring him back for you
to sit alone night after night.

388
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,200
I know.

389
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,200
But you see, I have this feeling
that when I laugh

390
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,220
or read a book or hum a tune,

391
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,220
it means that I've forgotten him.

392
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,180
Just for a moment.

393
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,280
And it's that that I can't bear.

394
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:35,320
Better by far that you
should forget and smile,

395
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,240
than that you should remember
and be sad.

396
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,180
But Rosetti was writing about
her own death, not her child's.

397
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,300
Will you come?

398
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,200
I came
as soon as I got your message.

399
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,220
I hope I didn't drag you away
from anything important.

400
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,180
Oh, no, I've finished for the day.

401
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,140
At Bakewell's?

402
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,080
I am in a predicament.

403
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,320
James, the first footman, has
sprained his wrist and cannot carry.

404
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,180
Mr Barrow feels
the duties are beneath him,

405
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,140
and in the meantime, we have
a party of 16 staying at the house.

406
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,240
You want me to be a footman?

407
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,320
I know it is far below your talents
but you do understand the duties

408
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,300
and since you are working
at Bakewell's...

409
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,160
You mean I can fall no further.

410
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,140
I wondered if you might do us
the great favour of helping me out.

411
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,120
I have come down in the world,
Mr Carson. We both know that.

412
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,300
I am a beggar and so, as the proverb
tells us, I cannot be a chooser.

413
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,180
Hmm!

414
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,300
Do you know
if Dame Nellie has arrived?

415
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,200
I believe so, m'lady.

416
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:06,180
But too late for tea! What a shame.

417
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,340
I was getting nervous but
apparently Dame Nellie is here.

418
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
Good.

419
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:15,120
Are you enjoying yourself so far?

420
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,220
Seeing the house
at full strength again? I am.

421
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,320
At any rate,
I'm enjoying most of it. Only most?

422
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,160
I don't want Sampson invited back.

423
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,320
I think he's rather a tyke.
Hmm.

424
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,120
How do you find Mr Gregson?

425
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:33,200
Well, Sampson hammered him but he
took it like a man, I will say that.

426
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,260
I hope you weren't caught up in it?
I was more of a spectator.

427
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,160
I hate gambling.

428
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,260
How can grown men throw away their
fortune like that? What could be
more stupid?

429
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,260
I couldn't agree more.

430
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,240
Mr Molesley, I thought it was you!
Are you a footman now?

431
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,200
I'm having my career backwards.
Ah, Mr Molesley.

432
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,280
Alfred will be acting first footman
so can you take your lead from him?

433
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,120
Why not? Perhaps Daisy'd like to
give me a pointer or two. Or Ivy?

434
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,120
And here are some clean gloves
that should fit you.

435
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,140
Gloves, Mr Carson?

436
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,240
I'm sorry, Mr Molesley,
you're not the butler here.

437
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,160
That is my job. You are a footman
and a footman wears gloves.

438
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,100
So if we could begin?

439
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,320
Everyone ready? Go!

440
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,160
Hey! You're pushing! You can't just
bulldoze us all to one side!

441
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,320
It's all part of the rules.
I've got the ace!

442
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,220
Someone's cheating!

443
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,320
What on earth can she be doing?
Should someone go up and see?

444
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,280
I thought she was going to sing
after dinner. She is.

445
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,340
Then why
would we want to see her before?

446
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:09,120
I er... I suppose you'll get up
a game again tonight, after the
singing?

447
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,280
During it, with any luck.

448
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,280
Then you must count me in.

449
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,320
You'll play again?
If you'll have me.

450
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,100
I think
I've got the trick of it now.

451
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,140
Very well. If you insist.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

452
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,160
Do you know Isabella Moncrieffe?
No.

453
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,120
She's blown up like a balloon!

454
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,260
She's in her room?
How long has she been there?

455
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,280
Her maid took her some tea
when she arrived... What?

456
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,320
I'm about to send up dinner.
Doesn't she want to eat with us?

457
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,320
I didn't think it appropriate,
ma'am, and his lordship agreed
with me.

458
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,180
I can't believe my ears.

459
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,280
Robert?

460
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,160
A world-famous singer
is in our house,

461
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,240
a great artist honoured by the King,

462
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,240
but you felt it beneath your dignity
to eat with her?

463
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,140
I don't recall... Am I the only
member of this family who lives in
the twentieth century?

464
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,240
What room is she in?
Princess Amelia, m'lady.

465
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,120
You will have her next to you
at dinner and you will like it!

466
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,260
But what do I say to her?
What does one say to a singer?

467
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,340
I blame you!

468
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,200
Now spoon it into the shells.

469
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,120
No, not like that!

470
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,240
Oh, give it here!
Mrs Patmore, we can do this.

471
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,100
Oh, can you? With Ivy slapping it
out like a trained seal.

472
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,240
Alfred, just remember that one's
for the Duchess. She can't eat...

473
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh! Oh my God!
What is it?

474
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,160
I've got a pain like a vice!
It's like a vice!

475
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,160
Ivy, fetch Mrs Hughes!
Alfred, help me get her to a chair.

476
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,160
No but who'll finish the dinner?

477
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,080
I've not made the bechamel yet
nor the dill sauce for the salmon!

478
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,320
Daisy? But I've all my own stuff
to do. I'll do it.

479
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,220
Madge is ringing for the doctor.
What is going on?

480
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,160
Alfred's making the sauces and
Mrs Patmore's having a heart attack!

481
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,280
I'm not surprised!
No, I mean really!

482
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,300
What on earth...
Don't ask.

483
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,260
Molesley? Oh, you're back?
I'm so glad.

484
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,260
They can't keep a good man down.

485
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,100
On the contrary, m'lady.
That's exactly what they can do.

486
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,120
I'm going to slip away later
for cards. I hope you won't mind.

487
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,120
Not with Sampson again?
You said you'd lost a packet.

488
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,220
Well...

489
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,120
Ah. It's time to turn.

490
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm so sorry about earlier. I hope
you didn't feel we'd abandoned you.

491
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,200
This is delicious.
I'm so pleased you like it.

492
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,100
Haut-Brion.
It's one of my favourites.

493
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,280
Did you read that on the menu?
I didn't need to.

494
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,280
I've made quite a study of Claret.

495
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh, well, then. This is going to be
much less uphill than I thought.

496
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll ring tomorrow and make an
appointment. Tom can come with me.

497
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,180
I'm sure you don't need my help
but it's yours for the asking.

498
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,260
Thank you.

499
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,180
May I take you out for dinner,
when you're in London?

500
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,200
I don't think Miss Lane Fox
would approve

501
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,080
and nor would I, really.

502
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,200
But I can't tell you what a lift
it is to hear that you'd like to.

503
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,180
Really?

504
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,300
Is something the matter?

505
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,100
If it is, it shouldn't be.

506
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,120
It's the first time I've
heard her laugh since it happened.

507
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,080
I know, and I don't want her
to spend her life in sorrow.

508
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,340
She's not the Lady of Shalott.

509
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,100
It's just I find it hard
to join in the merry-making.

510
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,340
We haven't all been making merry.

511
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:48,240
What it comes down to in the end
is this nice Lord Gillingham,

512
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,180
and Sir John over there,
and him and him and you,

513
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,300
you're all alive.

514
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,140
My son's dead.

515
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,180
Anna.

516
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,300
Anna!

517
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,220
ANNA!

518
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,340
Are you so involved in your game
you were unaware Mrs Patmore has
been taken ill?

519
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,240
What? What sort of ill?

520
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,180
Ill enough to make this racket
inappropriate.

521
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,160
Well, I was going to win.
Yes, I think you were.

522
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,120
Which is a good omen.
What for?

523
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,180
Never you mind.

524
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,140
Why are you being like this?
I was just having fun.

525
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,100
I'll leave you to it.
Please do.

526
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,260
Thank you for organising that,
Mr Gillingham. It was terrific.

527
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,340
How is she?
She'll live.

528
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,300
I think it was brought on by panic
over all the things that had to be
done.

529
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,160
There was a lot to be done. But
you mustn't let it overpower you.

530
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,160
Can I listen to Dame Nellie?
I think so.

531
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,120
But put your feet up
when they've left in the morning.

532
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,100
You should stay for the concert.

533
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,200
I don't want to be a nuisance
but it does seem too good to miss.

534
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,300
I'll go and put my bag in the car.

535
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,140
I don't know,
screaming in the servants' hall,

536
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:42,100
singers chatting to his lordship
and a footman cooking the dinner.

537
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,140
What a topsy-turvy world
we've come to.

538
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,200
I needed something to get me
through it and I see you've had the
same idea.

539
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,180
Are you all right?

540
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,120
No. I'm afraid I've let you down.

541
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,340
What? Why?

542
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Since Sybil died you allowed me
to believe I was one of you.

543
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,180
You are one of us. Now.

544
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,180
No, I'm not. Not when you're among
your own people.

545
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,280
Tom, something's upset you.
Was it the Duchess?

546
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,240
If so, I wouldn't pay
the slightest attention.

547
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,160
It wasn't her fault.
She was only trying to be nice.

548
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,320
It was me.

549
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,180
I don't belong here and these
past few days have shown me that.

550
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,100
I don't accept what you're saying
and Cora certainly won't.

551
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,260
But we must go now
or we'll get stick.

552
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Do any of you ever leave school?

553
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,140
♪ Seldom from

554

558
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,340

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,120
I'm sure you didn't.

563
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,320
Mr Carson said
they gobbled it up like gannets.

564
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,140
That's what I want to do,
Mrs Patmore.

565
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,220
One step at a time.

566
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,280

I've got a bit of a headache.

569
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,140
Because of the singing?

570
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,140
Well,
it's not making it any better.

571
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,120
Probably all that shouting
in the game.

572
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,120
And I'll thank you not to comment.

573
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,260
I'll pop down and get something.

574
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,280
And now for one of my favourites.

575
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,200
O Mio Babbino Caro
by Puccini from Gianni Schicchi.

576
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,320
And I'd like to dedicate
this to love and to lovers.

577
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,120
What a relief.

578
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,160
I thought we might have been in for
some of that dreadful German lieder.

579
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,300
You can always rely on Puccini.

580
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,320
I prefer Bartok.
Oh, you would.

581
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
Straight to the six.

582
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,140
Flush.

583
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,280
I don't understand how...
How what?

584
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,160
Sampson, you're not trying
to get out of paying up, are you?

585
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,180
Of course not.

586
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,100
Care for something stronger?

587
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,240
I shouldn't let Mr Carson
see you with that.

588
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,100
You want some?

589
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,100
I expect you're sick of it too.

590
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,240
A grown woman
screeching like a cat on a bonfire.

591
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,320
That's very naughty. I think Dame
Nellie has a beautiful voice.

592
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,200
Don't be silly. Let me pass.

593
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,320
You look to me like you could
use a bit of real fun for once.

594
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,300
Is that what you want?

595
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,340
What I want is to go back upstairs.

596
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,120
You're not telling me that
sad old cripple keeps you happy?

597
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,220
If you must know,
yes, he keeps me very happy.

598
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,280
Now let me by. Please.

599
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,140
Perhaps you've forgotten
what you're missing.

600
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,280
Argh!

601
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,280
I wonder what she's doing.

602
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,180
Maybe she's fallen asleep.

603
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,140
Well, she wouldn't get much sleep
up here, that's for sure.

604
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,260
I think we're both even.
So we'll leave you to it.

605
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,280
I assume you'll take an IOU?

606
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,220
Firstly I'll take all the IOUs
you've accumulated during your stay.

607
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,160
You may send me a cheque
for the rest.

608
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,120
I'm not sure I can allow that.

609
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,240
Or I'll tell Lord Grantham
how you won

610
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,300
and there won't be a club in London
to touch you with a ten foot pole.

611
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,280
Will you take a note
for the remainder of the debt? Yes.

612
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,300
It wouldn't be in your interest
to cross me.

613
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:28,220
You think you're so holy, don't you?

614
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,280
You're just a cheat, like me.

615
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,220
I have won against a card sharp.

616
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,300
There is pleasure in that.

617
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,340
I'm so pleased you came.
So am I.

618
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,200
I was wrong to hesitate but then
guilt has the power to make all of
us do strange things.

619
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,260
Oh! Well not all of us.

620
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,200
Guilt has never played
a major part in my life.

621
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,100
Amen to that.

622
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,180
I think these are yours.

623
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,120
Oh, I can't accept this.
Please do.

624
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,180
I won it off Sampson
fair and square.

625
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,240
Fair and square, eh?
Well, I won, anyway.

626
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,260
But the money's yours.
I don't want it.

627
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,200
Isn't that a better way
to end the house party?

628
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,240
How did it go?
Mr Gregson has saved my bacon.

629
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,160
But don't tell your mother.

630
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,280
How on earth did you do that?

631
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,120
I revived a dubious talent
from my misspent youth.

632
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,280
Well, that was a nice surprise,
I must say.

633
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,160
My whole stay has been full
of nice surprises.

634
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,240
I can't tell you how pleased I am
that I came. Really?

635
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,340
Then I'm pleased too.

636
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,160
What is it?
Whisky.

637
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,200
God, it's huge.

638
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,160
I thought you might need it.

639
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,300
You understand me, don't you?

640
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,140
I like to think so.

641
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Some fresh coffee, Mr Molesley.

642
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,100
Shut the door.
My God!

643
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,160
Shut the door!

644
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,160
Will you help me?
Will you find me some clothes?

645
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,280
Of course I will but...
Will you see to Lady Mary?

646
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,100
Say erm... Just say
I've gone home with a headache.

647
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,160
I can manage Lady Mary
but Anna, we must tell someone...

648
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,240
No, no, no!
But you'll have to tell Mr Bates...

649
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:59,240
Him least of all! He'd murder the
man who's done it and then he'd be
hanged.

650
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,080
But surely...
He's a convicted felon!

651
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,120
Do you think they'd spare him
a second time? No.

652
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,120
Maybe the doctor's still here.
Will you listen!

653
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,240
I need your help
or I wouldn't have told you.

654
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,180
Nobody else must ever know.

655
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,180
You promise me!

656
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,120
Wait here.

657
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,200
I'll fetch you some water
and a comb.

658
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,280
And see what I can find you
in the way of a dress.

659
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,220
Did you enjoy your evening?
Yes, I did rather.

660
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:49,120
You weren't too shocked, having
to talk to a professional singer?

661
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,260
You always make me out to be
so narrow minded but I liked her.

662
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,320
Because she appreciated your wine?

663
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,260
There are worse reasons.

664
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,180
And have you formed
an opinion of Mr Gregson?

665
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,240
Yes, as a matter of fact.

666
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:05,280
I'm not sure
he's what we want for Edith

667
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,320
but it's a changing world and I must
admit, he's a decent cove.

668
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,320
Heavens! A Damascene conversion.

669
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,120
What's brought this about?
Was it something he said?

670
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:19,240
It wasn't that so much.

671
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:24,340
But he did behave in a way
that I thought was really quite
gentlemanly.

672
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,220
Are you awake?

673
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,220
What happened to you?

674
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,320
I was drinking a powder
when I suddenly felt dizzy and I...

675
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,240
I must have fainted. I think I hit
the edge of the sink as I went down.

676
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,140
Stupid.
You've changed your dress.

677
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,240
Yes. It's badly marked.

678
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,300
I've put it in to soak
but I'm not sure I can save it.

679
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,160
Mrs Hughes lent me this.

680
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,320
Good night, Mr Bates. Mrs Bates.

681
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,300
And thank you for looking after me
while I've been here.

682
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,220
Good night, Mr Gillingham.

683
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,160
Good night, Mr Gillingham.

684
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,260
What's the matter?
Nothing.

685
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:26,140
I just feel like walking on my own.
That's all.

686
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,140
Anna!

687
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,160
I blush to admit it
but I was very drunk.

688
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,240
So you're not going to deny it?
If I behaved badly, I am sorry.

689
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,160
Sorry to keep you waiting but Anna
couldn't find... Oh! I hope I'm a
surprise and not a shock.

690
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,240
I could take you all
to hear the new band at the club.

691
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,320
But tonight you've made me
play truant. And I like it.

692
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,280
Jack Ross at your service.

693
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,280
I'm Rose MacClare. How do you do?

694
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,120
You're trusting this man
with your name and your reputation.

695
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,320
Michael, I...
Oh, my darling.

696
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,100
We live together, we work together.
Sometimes I think it's just too
much.

1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,750
- Shall I help?
- Well, you can.

2
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,390
- You know what these
are, don't you? - No.

3
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,080
Pig boards. They control the pigs.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,750
Are you annoyed we've given
Yew Tree Farm to Mr Mason?

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,550
I'm annoyed you fixed it
while I was in London,

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,990
but no, he's a good man.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,910
And I hear pigs are his speciality.

8
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,100
No wonder you were convinced.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,200
So now that you've settled in, have you
decided what your next task will be?

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,720
You haven't done much about the repair shop
while I was away, so I'll start with that.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,200
I had an idea to put it on the edge of
the estate with access to the village.

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,790
For passing trade?

13
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,910
Why not?

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,900
Is Papa ready for that?

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,680
Hmm. You must be gentle with him.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,550
When does Mr Mason move in?

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,870
His equipment's already there.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,750
And the Drewes leave on Wednesday,
so there's no point in waiting.

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,510
And what about his old farm?

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,710
Mr Henderson's taken over the land.

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,710
He's going to move his uncle into
the house, much good may it do him.

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,750
Nay. There's no need for bitterness now.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,270
Things have worked out well.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,310
- You're right.
- Oh, I tell you what.

25
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,240
Why don't we go over on the day? We'll
take a picnic tea and lend him a hand.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,550
I could come, too. Another pair of hands.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,940
And very welcome, I have no doubt.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,720
Good news?

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,470
Oh, it's just a friend who's
going to be in London.

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,470
- He wants to meet up.
- He?

31
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,790
It's nothing like that.

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,750
It's Bertie Pelham, the
agent from Brancaster Castle.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,910
I remember him. He shot with us.

34
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,440
And he helped get the magazine
out during my night of terror.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,430
The Dowager Countess.

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,310
Hello, Granny. What are you doing here?

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,840
My dear. I am in need of a favour.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,270
Is Cora about?

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,870
Er, no, she's got some
charity thing in the village.

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,260
Oh, good.

41
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,790
Why don't I like the sound of that?

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
I'll leave you.

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,160
The Minister of Health
is paying us a visit.

44
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,110
Mr Chamberlain? I don't think so.

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,440
Now, listen. He's on an
inspection tour of the north.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,870
He wants to see what's been
happening since the war.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,920
- Seems very sensible.
- And I want him to come here.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,640
I want him to listen to our arguments
against the York Hospital's plans.

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,270
Mama, what is the point?

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,070
Don't be jejune. You know very well,

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,160
one word from Westminster and
the scheme would be abandoned.

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,960
But why would he say the word, and
why would he ever come to Downton?

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,760
You know, Neville Chamberlain's
wife was born Anne de Vere Cole.

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,270
Guess who was her godfather.

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,790
You guess for me.

56
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Your late papa, the
sixth Earl of Grantham.

57
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,600
He and her father served in the
Crimea together when they were young.

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,630
I have known her since she was born.

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,550
I admit I am quite interested, but
when it comes to getting him here,

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,280
I would say you have no more chance
than a cat in hell without claws.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
We'll see.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Mr Carson has suggested we might
have dinner in our cottage tonight,

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,710
so I thought I'd ask your advice.

64
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,910
Oh, is this going to be a regular thing?

65
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,190
I don't think so. Once in a while.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,430
Well, there's pate left
over and some chops.

67
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,150
- I'll make up a basket.
- Would you?

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,630
Oh, that would be so kind.

69
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,150
When did you last cook?

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,430
I've done the odd thing...

71
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,840
Oh, well, of course, as we
all know, anyone can cook.

72
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't be like that. It's not my idea.

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,790
But it might be nice.

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,230
Mrs Patmore's just jealous.

75
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,240
I'm sure she's not.

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,860
But I would be grateful for the basket.

77
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,030
Well, maybe I am.

78
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,550
I nearly forgot. That chap, Henry...

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,630
- Talbot?
- Exactly.

80
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,310
Yes, he telephoned while you were out.

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,870
He's going to be in Yorkshire on Wednesday

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,830
to look at a car and he wants
you to watch him doing it.

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,440
Hmm. To watch him looking at a car?

84
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Well, not quite. He's driving
it round some track nearby.

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,870
- At Catterick.
- Testing it.

86
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,270
Seeing how it handles.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,950
- I could take you, if you like.
- Would you?

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,550
Well, I'd like to see it.

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,950
- How about you?
- I'll be in London on Wednesday.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,030
Edith has a date.

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,950
- No, I don't.
- Of course not.

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,310
What do you mean, "Of course not"?

93
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,510
Doctor Clarkson seems to be coming round.

94
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,150
Isobel's bringing him for a
drink tonight with Dickie Merton.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,150
So that's why Mama paid her visit.

96
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,510
When? What did she want?

97
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,870
Neville Chamberlain is coming north.

98
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,160
She wants him to dine here, so she
can convince him to support her.

99
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,070
If he's on a tour, it'll be far
too late to alter his schedule.

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,600
That's what I said, but she seems
to think she can persuade him.

101
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
Is it wrong to hope she's mistaken?

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,550
Anything interesting?

103
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,760
It's Sergeant Willis saying he'll collect
me on Wednesday at nine, to go to York.

104
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,380
For the trial.

105
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,870
Would you like me to come, too?

106
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,950
- Could you get the time off?
- Well, I could ask.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,910
You shouldn't have to
go to the trial alone.

108
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,990
What trial?

109
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,550
Miss Baxter has been called
to be a witness on Wednesday.

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,870
I want to go along, keep her company.

111
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,590
- I think you should.
- Mr Carson will understand.

112
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,870
I'm only a character witness.

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,150
Character witnesses can
make all the difference.

114
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,750
Why do they want you to testify?

115
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,510
There's a man being
tried for theft and I...

116
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,830
I knew him once.

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,030
Will your words affect the outcome?

118
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,230
- Possibly.
- You must think about it carefully.

119
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,380
She has thought about it,
Mr Bates. Very carefully.

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,590
- Where were you?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Barrow.

121
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,270
It was only coffee for the family,
so I thought Andy could manage.

122
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,990
He could. But it's for me to say, not you.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,030
I'm going into the village in
a while. Do you want to come?

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,590
Thanks, but no, thanks.

125
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,030
I thought you needed some things.

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,310
Nothing urgent.

127
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,630
Right. Is that it?

128
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,080
Er... Yes.

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,510
I'm glad to see you here again, Dickie.

130
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,070
Well, it's very good to be here, but
it's only about the row, I'm afraid.

131
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,150
Oh, never mind that.

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,710
We've brought Doctor Clarkson with
us because there's something that you,

133
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,910
or at any rate, Cora, will want to hear.

134
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,190
Do I detect that you're changing sides?

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,640
Er, maybe.

136
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,990
Have you told my mother?

137
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,910
Poor man. If he's changing his
mind, don't let's put him off.

138
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,750
Oh, that reminds me. I
have a message from her.

139
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,760
She says that the Health Minister
is happy to dine here this Friday.

140
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,790
What? How did she manage that?

141
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,550
She must have found a
way to blackmail him.

142
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,750
- You don't mean that.
- I wouldn't put it past her.

143
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,280
If she's convinced him to come here,
she can make him condemn the scheme.

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,070
Well, she mustn't.

145
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,470
And I want the three of
you here to support me.

146
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,260
Aye, aye, Captain.

147
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,190
Is Mr Barrow getting on your nerves?

148
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,720
- Only earlier, you seemed to --
- No, it's not that.

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,110
He only means to be friendly.

150
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,750
I know. And he was good to
me when I first arrived.

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,670
So, what is it, then?

152
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
Well...

153
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,070
Since I've come, I've got to
know a bit more about him.

154
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,720
I don't like to say with a lady present.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,190
We both know Mr Barrow pretty well.

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,510
The point is, I wouldn't want
to give him any wrong ideas.

157
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,790
I'm not sure that's fair.

158
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,910
Fair or not, I think it's
better if he knows what's what.

159
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,870
I bear him no ill will, mind.

160
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,070
We are what we are.

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,990
Isn't that the truth?

162
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,990
My compliments to the chef.

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,240
Who is Mrs Patmore, not me.

164
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,830
What was Mr Molesley asking?

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,760
Er, he wants to accompany Miss
Baxter into York on Wednesday morning.

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,310
Apparently, you've said she can go.

167
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,830
I have, yes.

168
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,070
- Will you let him?
- I don't see why not.

169
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,710
- What's it for?
- Sergeant Willis needs her help.

170
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,590
Sergeant Willis again?

171
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,120
Do other butlers have to contend with
the police arriving every ten minutes?

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,270
Not often.

173
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
Now, are you ready?

174
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,340
Hmm.

175
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,310
Are... Are these done enough?

176
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,600
Yes.

177
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,470
Shall I fetch the vegetables?

178
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,360
This plate's cold, which is a pity.

179
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
Ah, what's this?

180
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,910
What do you think?

181
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,630
Bubble and squeak.

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
As a vegetable with lamb?

183
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,720
I like it with lamb.

184
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,520
Well, we mustn't let it get cold.

185
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,950
This knife could do with sharpening.

186
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,830
All settled in for the night?

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,910
She is, but she won't sleep a wink.

188
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,110
She's too annoyed and I don't blame her.

189
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,150
- What's happened now?
- She says Doctor Clarkson has only planned

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,470
to throw her over for Mrs Crawley.

191
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,390
- She's seen it coming.
- What do you mean?

192
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,430
He doesn't want to support
her ladyship any more.

193
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,400
What cheek!

194
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,070
Don't go working yourself up.

195
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,960
Who does he think he is?

196
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,030
Jumped up little saw-bones!

197
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,950
I should steer clear.

198
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,120
No doubt.

199
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,830
But you and I don't think
alike, do we, Mr Spratt?

200
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,020
On this or any other subject.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll wish you good night.

202
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,750
When's your train?

203
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,230
- Nine. - Is this
another magazine crisis?

204
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,390
No. But I am interviewing
possible editors.

205
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,550
Women?

206
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,910
- Women. - Well, I approve.
Good luck with that.

207
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,430
- But then, who's the date with?
- It's not a date.

208
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,950
It's just a friend, as I keep saying.

209
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,280
What are you up to today? Haven't
you got some plan with a racing car?

210
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,870
Later. We're looking for a site
for the repair shop this morning.

211
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,230
Then we'll go over to
Catterick after lunch.

212
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,750
I want to look in on Mason before we do.

213
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,310
- He's moving in today.
- As long as the pigs are settled.

214
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,070
You joke, but I am concerned.

215
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,990
I've asked him to take over, but
pig-keeping needs physical strength,

216
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,150
- now I think of it.
- You're right, of course.

217
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,550
They're strong and can be dangerous.

218
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,710
Ask him if he's up to it.

219
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,190
- I think I must.
- A day of racing cars and pigs.

220
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,110
Who could better that?

221
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,640
- Who's dining at home this time?
- Nobody.

222
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,390
It's to welcome Daisy's Mr Mason.

223
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,790
He's moving in today.

224
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,710
Wish him well from me.

225
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,240
And I hope he gets more fun out
of his hamper than Mr Carson did.

226
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,430
Why? What was the matter with it?

227
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,430
Nothing was the matter with it.

228
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,400
Except for the fact that, I don't
seem to cook like his mother.

229
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,080
Oh, I think the correct response
is to say "Men!" and sigh.

230
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,880
What's this?

231
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,880
Don't mind us.

232
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,630
- How can I help?
- Miss Baxter is expecting me?

233
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Daisy, run and fetch her.

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,030
Look after Miss Baxter, Sergeant.

235
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,080
- She's in a very frail frame of mind.
- I'll do me best.

236
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,360
But we're after catching a nasty fish
and he's bound to thresh about a bit.

237
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,110
And we'll get caught in the spray?

238
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,830
Good luck, love.

239
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,760
If we put the gate here, you'd be on
a lane that links with the main road.

240
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,510
You'd get power and plumbing
from the supply at King's Barrow.

241
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,750
Why don't we put the repair shed there?

242
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,350
King's Barrow is a working farm.

243
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,230
There isn't a spare farmyard
half as accessible as here.

244
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,480
We ought to look at the costs.

245
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,870
It's good of you to come with me today.

246
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,190
Glad to, but he won't want me there.

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,240
Nonsense. You have far more
in common with him than I do.

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
Is it serious?

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,080
He's attractive and nice,

250
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,440
and it's good to remember
I'm a youngish woman again.

251
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,670
But that's all.

252
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,060
Youngish?

253
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't mean to sound snobbish,
but I won't marry down.

254
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,430
Was Mr Matthew Crawley so
very special in that way?

255
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,800
Matthew was the heir to
the earldom and estate.

256
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,990
I don't want to be
grander than my husband.

257
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,390
Or richer.

258
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,160
It may surprise you, but I agree
it's important to be balanced,

259
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,790
that one should not be far
stronger than the other.

260
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,200
I just don't think it has much
to do with money or position.

261
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,800
Is that how you felt about Sybil?

262
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,510
To all of you, she had
everything and I had nothing.

263
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,200
She was the great lady, and
I the man who drove the cars,

264
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,520
but that wasn't true for us.

265
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,760
We were evenly matched, Sybil and I.

266
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,440
She was strong in her beliefs, so was I.

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,240
We were a marriage of
equals. We were very happy.

268
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,950
I think we see that now.

269
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,710
The family, I mean.

270
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,510
Not at first, you're right.

271
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,900
But now.

272
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,370
- Good day to you.
- Good day?

273
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,850
A wonder you've got the
nerve to speak to me.

274
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,860
- I beg your pardon?
- Throwing over my lady,

275
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,410
when she's been running this
village since you were eating

276
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,210
porridge in the glen with your mummy.

277
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,930
I don't believe I am required
to justify my actions to you.

278
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,530
Because you can't.

279
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,060
Tell me, what would you
call it? Gratitude?

280
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,650
Because I'd call it treason.

281
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,860
Would you? Well, I call it impertinence,
to a degree that is not acceptable.

282
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,300
And I'm afraid you haven't
heard the last of this.

283
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,730
Well, you look very chirpy.

284
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,090
Oh, I think we'll have fun.

285
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,090
Besides, I've had some news.

286
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,090
They've nearly finished
the work on my house.

287
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,730
- Oh, that was quick.
- Was it?

288
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,610
It doesn't feel very
quick, but it's almost done.

289
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,610
Now you just have to find some customers.

290
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,980
But it's exciting, isn't it?

291
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,810
- Did you hear?
- That he changed his plea? Yes.

292
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,730
I was in court. I've only just come out.

293
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,260
I expect when he heard that you turned
up, he must've known it was pointless.

294
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,140
So I've been spared.

295
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,810
How do you feel?

296
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,170
In one way, I feel relieved, of course.

297
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,260
The newspapers won't find me and
there'll be no repercussions.

298
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,690
- But?
- I suppose I'd worked myself up

299
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,780
into facing him across courtroom,
this man who ruined my life,

300
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,700
and now it feels a bit anticlimactic.

301
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,780
Shall I go back in and ask him
to plead not guilty after all?

302
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,900
No, thank you.

303
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,140
We should leave. Sergeant
Willis is fetching the car.

304
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,820
It does me good to see a friendly
woman bustling about a kitchen.

305
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,020
I've got tea for all of us,
and a snack for you later on.

306
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,330
You're an angel of mercy.

307
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,490
Are we interrupting?

308
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,610
Not a bit of it, m'lady.

309
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,890
You're very welcome here.

310
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,650
We had just wanted to look
in to see how you were doing.

311
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,930
Daisy can tell you where
to find our office.

312
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,320
Daisy will be a great help to me.

313
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,140
We wanted to discuss the pigs.

314
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,290
- Shall we go outside?
- We can talk here, m'lady.

315
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,250
There's nothing private about it.

316
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,530
Very well.

317
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,170
Of course, I understand you
have a lot of experience.

318
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,370
A great deal.

319
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,970
I'm top at pigs.

320
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,530
But Lady Mary is a little worried
about the physical side of it.

321
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,620
Prising a boar off a sow or taking
the piglets from their mother.

322
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,420
Is this because I'm older than I was?

323
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,420
Of course, you may have already
chosen a farm hand to help you.

324
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,460
We've discussed it, Mr Mason and I.

325
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,890
He'll give me warning when there's
any chance of a bit of strong arm

326
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,370
and I'll walk down from the house.

327
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,090
So you'll be there for the servicing,
and the separating and the rest of it?

328
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,770
We'll plan it round when
Mr Carson can release me.

329
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,170
- It's not every day.
- That's very good of you, Andrew.

330
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,330
I want to train in the
care of pigs, m'lady.

331
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,290
I want to learn as much
as I can about farming.

332
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,460
Oh, I see. Well, good.

333
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,210
That seems to settle it.

334
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:28,760
We must go. We're on our way
to Catterick and we're late.

335
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,140
- We hope you'll be very happy here.
- Thank you.

336
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,260
Well, I do want to train.

337
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,810
I do want to learn.

338
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,860
It were no word of a lie.

339
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,890
Why does Lord Hexham spend
so much time in Tangier?

340
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,570
I suppose he likes it there.

341
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,410
If I had Brancaster Castle, I'm
not sure I'd ever want to leave.

342
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,860
I agree.

343
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,490
He's not really a country type.

344
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,890
More arty than sporty,
if you know what I mean.

345
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,930
He doesn't hunt or shoot?

346
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
Hardly. He paints.

347
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,490
What does he paint?

348
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,180
The young men of Tangier, mainly.

349
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,450
You know, scenes of local life.

350
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,420
And he's never wanted to marry?

351
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,970
I wouldn't quite say that.

352
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,810
It's always been sort of
understood that he and his cousin,

353
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,850
Adela Graham, will marry eventually.

354
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,330
Understood by whom?

355
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,450
By the two sets of parents.

356
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,600
How romantic.

357
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,170
But you like him?

358
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,650
You wouldn't ever want to
find something else to do?

359
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,610
I'd hate to leave Brancaster

360
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,860
and I'm very fond of Cousin Peter,
even if he isn't a countryman.

361
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,340
He hasn't a nasty bone in his body.

362
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,050
What are we doing this evening?

363
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,530
Have I got your evening, too?

364
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,210
Come to my flat for a
drink, I'll show it to you.

365
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,890
Then we can go somewhere else. You choose.

366
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,610
What a racy plan.

367
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,170
Not as racy as all that, worse luck.

368
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,210
But I'd like your opinion.

369
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,130
And you shall have it.

370
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,370
Charlie's going to beat him
again. It infuriates him.

371
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,010
Mr Rogers is a good driver.

372
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,130
I know, but they take such risks.

373
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,010
I hate it. I just hate it.

374
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,890
There's no such thing
as slow motor racing.

375
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,420
Even so.

376
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,650
And there's no such thing as safe love.

377
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,930
Real love means giving
someone the power to hurt you.

378
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,120
Which I won't concede easily.

379
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,330
She went well.

380
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,250
She's perfect, Charles.
Don't change a thing.

381
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,090
I think I started after you.

382
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,810
You're a bad loser!

383
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,610
- Well?
- How fast.

384
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,490
That is the general idea.

385
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,170
It looks like she handles well.

386
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,370
Will you take her to Brooklands?

387
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,570
Brooklands and other tracks.

388
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,610
I think I've found my new
car. What do you say, Charlie?

389
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,770
Well, she must be good to beat me.

390
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,570
- If you did.
- Oh, I did and I will again.

391
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,050
Then we must celebrate.

392
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,930
Well, there's a pub at Catterick.

393
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,170
Not for me, I'm afraid. I have to go home.

394
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,690
- Oh.
- Let's go anyway.

395
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,940
Okay. Just let me get changed.

396
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,890
Help him to enjoy it.

397
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,940
You don't have to marry him, but you
do have to let him enjoy this moment.

398
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,410
You're not nervous? Because I would be.

399
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,490
No. I'm looking forward to it.

400
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,930
We'll make a pig man of you yet.

401
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,010
I'll lend you some books
when we go inside.

402
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,650
- Books?
- On pig breeding and care.

403
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,450
You need to know the theory of it.

404
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,890
You'll be glad of the knowledge.

405
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,210
It makes the work more logical.

406
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,900
Well, then.

407
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,440
Thank you, we'll be in touch.

408
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,090
- How many more?
- Just one.

409
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,450
Miss Edmunds.

410
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,810
Send her in.

411
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,730
If you'd like to go in now.

412
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,450
Please sit down.

413
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,090
I've been reading about
your many achievements.

414
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,770
Oh, I see you were born in '92.

415
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,300
I know I might seem too young to be
an editor, but I do have experience.

416
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,610
I was just going to say
we're born in the same year.

417
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,620
Er, have you seen a copy
of our latest edition?

418
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,410
I produced it, actually.

419
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Our editor had left, so it was down
to me and the rest of the office,

420
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,850
and during one horror-filled
night, we did it.

421
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,450
But then are you sure you need me?

422
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,220
Oh, I am. But I have at least proved
you're old enough to be an editor.

423
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,980
Because I was.

424
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,580
1892 seems a million years ago now.

425
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,060
Another time, another age.

426
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,810
That might be worth exploring.

427
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,170
Victorian babies grown into modern women.

428
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,290
And the price they've paid.

429
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,570
Oh. Thank you, Audrey.

430
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,330
Mmm, this is something like it.

431
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,860
I think you'll do well here.

432
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,170
So do I.

433
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,090
And you know what I wish?
That our Daisy would live here.

434
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,500
You can still work at the big
house, but make a home with me.

435
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,090
- I don't know.
- What is it?

436
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,890
A 20-minute walk? What's that?

437
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,210
I'll have to think about it.

438
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,370
I wouldn't have to think long.
This place is like heaven to me.

439
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,460
You never set foot off a
pavement for 18 years,

440
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,970
and now it's all harvests and pig farming.

441
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,410
Well, not everyone's right
for what they're born to.

442
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,900
Very true. These are the books I spoke of.

443
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,330
You'll learn most from the work, I know,

444
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,530
but, er, they'll give you a grounding.

445
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,210
- If you're serious.
- I am.

446
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,580
Now, what else can I give you?
Another cup of tea, why not?

447
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,400
Don't mind if I do.

448
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,740
I'm afraid Mummy, and Daddy,
and Aunt Edith are all away,

449
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,210
so you must make do with Granny and Donk.

450
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,460
Is Granny Violet a Red Indian?

451
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,050
Why on earth do you say that?

452
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,780
Nanny said she was on the war path.

453
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,860
Come and look at these
books I've put out for you.

454
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,420
These are some of the places
Donk and I have visited.

455
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,140
Chamberlain's office rang to confirm
that he is dining here on Friday.

456
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,730
I wish he weren't.

457
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,450
But you'll line up the opposition?

458
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,090
Certainly. I already have.

459
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,730
What a nuisance it is.

460
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,130
Mama is not a good loser.

461
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,850
She's had so little experience.

462
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,260
You couldn't just back off and
let the cards fall as they may.

463
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:28,820
Robert, for 30 years, I've striven
to let your mother have her own way

464
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,450
but this is too important.

465
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,410
I appreciate that her
motives are honourable,

466
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,620
but that's not enough when
she's damaging people's lives.

467
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,170
Oh.

468
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,690
We can cancel, if I'm
allowed to say you're ill.

469
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,010
I'm not ill enough, and
she'd only rearrange it.

470
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,410
She can obviously get Chamberlain
to do whatever she wants,

471
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,130
though heaven knows why.

472
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,410
What's this?

473
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,690
That's the Sphinx, darling. In Egypt.

474
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,180
- What?
- The Sphinx.

475
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,340
A creature of secrets
that she never reveals.

476
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,500
Rather like Granny Violet.

477
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,820
What time will you get there, on Friday?

478
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,140
Well, not much before eight.

479
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,540
I want to be in possession of the room
by the time Mr Chamberlain arrives.

480
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,700
Oh, dear!

481
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,090
Bad news?

482
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,290
Oh, dear...

483
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,250
I wouldn't have brought it if I'd known.

484
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,250
Er, Spratt, would you ask
Denker to come up here please?

485
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,040
Of course, m'lady.

486
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,690
You're quite agitated.

487
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,410
Denker has disgraced herself.

488
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,050
Well, how distressing for you.

489
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,660
It's not that so much.

490
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,370
It means I shall have to find a new maid.

491
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,620
Yes, I see. A real punishment.

492
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,850
M'lady?

493
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,170
Is it true you called
Doctor Clarkson a traitor?

494
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,300
What? Surely not? Denker?

495
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,340
I just thought he'd behaved
very badly towards your ladyship.

496
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,540
It is not your place even to
have opinions of my acquaintance.

497
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,210
Let alone express them.

498
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,620
He can't claim your friendship now?
Not when he's turned against you!

499
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,740
If I withdrew my friendship from
everyone who had spoken ill of me,

500
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,530
my address book would be empty.

501
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,650
Yes, but surely...

502
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,900
For a lady's maid to insult a
physician in the open street!

503
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,300
You've read too many novels, Denker.
You've seen too many moving pictures.

504
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,170
I was sticking up for you.

505
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,090
And for that, I will
write a tepid character,

506
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,730
which may enable you to
find employment elsewhere.

507
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,010
But from this house,
you must go, forthwith.

508
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,090
But m'lady...

509
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,690
You may stay tonight, but
you must go tomorrow.

510
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,880
Go!

511
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,500
Are you sure? I can't believe Doctor
Clarkson could wish her to lose her position.

512
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,650
Then he shouldn't have sent it.

513
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,580
When we unleash the dogs of war,
we must go where they take us.

514
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,270
Sorry about that. There
was rather a queue.

515
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,630
It's popular. That's a good sign.

516
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,070
Oh, you don't know the place?

517
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,830
You'll laugh at me, but I've
hardly ever been in a public house.

518
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Matthew wasn't really a pub man and
Papa goes into the Grantham Arms

519
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,390
about once a year to have
a drink with the tenants.

520
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,390
Well, I'm afraid my life is
an altogether rougher affair.

521
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,180
Consider me warned.

522
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,230
So the car's a success?

523
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,750
Well, I wasn't convinced
it would be, but it is.

524
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,070
You must have a go sometime.

525
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,190
I hope that's a real offer.

526
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,470
You know, I didn't realise
you were so keen, Tom. Blast!

527
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,790
You could have driven her today.

528
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,510
You know I came to Downton as a chauffeur?

529
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,630
Oh, Mary told me.

530
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,310
But then, not every chauffeur
has a real love of cars.

531
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,510
That's true enough.

532
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,230
Oh, I'll tell you who was
talking about you the other day.

533
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,430
Evelyn Napier.

534
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,430
- Oh, how is he?
- He's well.

535
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,000
Still single, of course, and, I
suspect, still pining for you.

536
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,080
He will pine in vain, but
I'm very fond of him.

537
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,110
La Belle Dame sans Merci.

538
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,750
What does that mean?

539
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,520
It means Lady Mary knows what she's about.

540
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,880
Tell you what, next time you're down
south, why don't we all have dinner?

541
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,470
I'd love that.

542
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,910
- You are funny.
- What do you mean?

543
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,150
The way you have to keep making
reasons for why you'll meet.

544
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,870
You to watch him drive cars, you
to have dinner with a friend.

545
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Why can't you just say, "I'd
love to spend more time with you,

546
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,150
"when can we do it?"

547
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,790
You see? He may have
assimilated in some ways,

548
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,510
but he still fights playing by the rules.

549
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,520
What are those?

550
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
Oh! I didn't hear you come in.

551
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,120
Mr Mason's lent me some books on
pig-rearing and farming, generally.

552
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,510
I'm going to help with the pigs.

553
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,360
Oh, I see.

554
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,470
Which will you start with?

555
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,190
The red one, I think.

556
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,440
The "red one." Who's it by?

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
FJ Connell.

558
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,230
Does that mean anything to you?

559
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,680
Not a lot.

560
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,790
This must be the most sophisticated
room I've ever been in.

561
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,470
The taste is all Michael's.

562
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,990
He was very artistic and very clever.

563
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,510
So, are you going to live here?

564
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,430
I think I'll live here more.

565
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,960
I'd like a life away from Downton.

566
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,750
Because you like London?

567
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,160
Well, the house, the estate,

568
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,640
they're all Mary's now,
more than Papa realises.

569
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,000
It's time for me to strike
out in my own direction,

570
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,960
not just dawdle in Mary's wake.

571
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,230
When do you go home this time?

572
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,880
Tomorrow. My work is done here.

573
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,670
I've found my new editor and
we've got a government minister

574
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,430
coming for dinner on Friday,
so we're all on parade.

575
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,070
That's very swanky.

576
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,110
- Is your father political?
- Not at all.

577
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,750
It's my grandmother who's invited him.

578
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,910
How impressive!

579
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
She is rather.

580
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,190
Shall we go?

581
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,920
I love the Cafe de Paris.

582
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,390
How did you know to choose it?

583
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,780
I knew we'd love the same things.

584
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,000
God, what a relief.

585
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,150
I thought I might be pushing my luck.

586
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Oh, no.

587
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,710
I suppose you've guessed
how much I like you.

588
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,070
You don't know me.

589
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,600
I know you enough to think about
you all the time when we're apart.

590
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,420
That's very sweet.

591
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,760
Of course, I haven't much to offer.

592
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,080
You have a great deal to offer

593
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,200
and I am not sure I'm worthy of it,

594
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,600
but for now let's just enjoy a good dinner

595
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,150
and some dancing.

596
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,940
No arguments here.

597
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,440
- So it was a good day?
- Oh, yes.

598
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,470
A happy ending to a trying
time for the poor man.

599
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,150
Daisy fought well in his cause.

600
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,070
If not always very sensibly.

601
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,360
He's a lovely chap, though,
kind and considerate.

602
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,390
Oh, he wants Daisy to live there,
but I suppose that's understandable.

603
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,470
He must be lonely.

604
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,990
He's not lonely. He's
lived on his own for years.

605
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,630
- He's used to it.
- He enjoyed a bit of company today.

606
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,070
He was just being polite.

607
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,680
I expect he was longing for us to go.

608
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,990
You mustn't mind when Mr Mason
makes new friends, Daisy,

609
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,750
now that he's here among us.

610
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,110
Of course I don't mind.

611
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,910
I just think he's fine as he is.

612
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,510
I'm ready to walk up to
the cottage if you are.

613
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,350
- Of course. - Ah, Mrs
Patmore, I haven't thanked you

614
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,510
for our supper the other night.

615
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,710
I'm always happy to help.

616
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,910
I'm very grateful.

617
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,960
But another time, I wonder if you might go
through the cooking of it with Mrs Hughes.

618
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,550
- Oh, yes? - It's been a
while since she's played

619
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,080
with her patty pans, and she's
got some catching-up to do.

620
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,830
You'd be glad of the help, wouldn't you?

621
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,760
Very glad and very grateful.

622
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,380
And now I must fetch my coat.

623
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,630
I'm sorry, Miss Denker.

624
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,270
I simply don't see I have a role to play.

625
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,590
So you're just going to sit
there and let me be dismissed?

626
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,190
How did it happen?

627
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,240
- Were you drunk?
- No, I was not drunk!

628
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,750
I was shocked!

629
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,640
Shocked at the short memory of a
doctor who's failed his patroness!

630
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,670
I doubt he sees it in that light.

631
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,680
That's the way I saw it
and I acted accordingly.

632
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,710
Am I to blame if I have
a very passionate nature?

633
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,110
Any more of that talk and
I won't be able to sleep.

634
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,640
You won't sleep a wink if I am
still sacked when we go upstairs.

635
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,040
That's a risk I'll have to take.

636
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,960
♪ Crying cockles and
mussels Alive, alive, oh ♪

637
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm dreading this dinner on Friday.

638
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,830
So are we all, but we
have to get through it.

639
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,160
I'm afraid Mama seems to see this argument as
the last battle, the last big fight of her life.

640
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,280
If she loses, there'll be hell to pay.

641
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,680
Then there'll be hell to pay.

642
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,150
Added to which, I'm feeling pretty rough.

643
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,280
I'm sure it's only indigestion,
but whether it is or not,

644
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,470
I'll be glad of a chance
to put my feet up.

645
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,230
It's too late to cancel, but I'd be
happy to manage the evening without you,

646
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,310
if you're really ill.

647
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,510
Mama would only say I'd ratted on her.

648
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,310
No. As you say, I'll get through it

649
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
and then take things
quietly for a few days.

650
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,870
How did that happen?

651
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,910
I threw a book and it caught it.

652
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,960
Oh, yes. The red one.
Why did you throw it?

653
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,380
Why did you throw the book, Andy?

654
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,560
- You can't read, can you?
- No. I can't bloody read!

655
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,550
Go on! Have a good laugh about it!

656
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,910
I'm not laughing.

657
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,110
You've been good at hiding
it. I must say that.

658
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,150
Flicking through your magazines.

659
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,340
I only look at the pictures.

660
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,470
Why did you not learn at school?

661
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,160
I fooled around until it was too late.

662
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
I learned how to sign my name,
which was all I needed in service.

663
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,310
But now you want to be a farmer.

664
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,000
I could be a farm labourer,
but I want more than that.

665
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,550
And if I can't read, then
it won't be possible.

666
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,720
So another dream goes west.

667
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,000
It doesn't have to.

668
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,400
I'll teach you to read and
write, too, if you want.

669
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,240
I must be too stupid.

670
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,520
I've never picked it up so far, and
I would have if I had half a brain.

671
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,560
That's not true. You're a clever lad.

672
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,180
You will get the hang of it. Trust me.

673
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,320
- But what would the others say?
- We won't tell them.

674
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,270
We'll talk about it in
the morning, all right?

675
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,400
Mr Barrow.

676
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,840
I've not behaved well towards you.

677
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,590
And I'm sorry for it.

678
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,070
I've known worse.

679
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,110
Good night, Andy.

680
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Oh! You're up early.

681
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,670
I suppose you have quite a day ahead.

682
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,470
- Are you packed?
- No.

683
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,870
I have not packed.

684
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,190
Shouldn't leave it too long.

685
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,150
You should take up her
breakfast and dress her,

686
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,680
to be sure of your reference,
and then, er, head off.

687
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,150
Is that all you've got to say?

688
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,240
Don't look at me. It's not my fault
and there is nothing I can do.

689
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,080
Did they catch your nephew?

690
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,350
- What?
- Your nephew.

691
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,230
The one who was on the
run from the police.

692
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,150
The one you sheltered here.

693
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,760
Did they catch him?

694
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,120
I don't believe so. No.

695
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,240
I wonder if that was because
he was allowed to rest here.

696
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,260
I think, maybe, it was.

697
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,440
Septimus Spratt, if I am sacked,
I am taking you down with me.

698
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,680
And my sin is not a criminal offence.

699
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
What can I do?

700
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,550
I can't talk to her before she's dressed.

701
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,470
No. Well, while you're waiting, you
can think of what you're going to say.

702
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,620
Unless you want to find
yourself sewing mail bags.

703
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,430
I'm not promising anything. I mean,
suppose she doesn't listen to me?

704
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,440
You'd better hope she does, Mr Spratt.

705
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,560
You'd better hope she does.

706
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,430
I think she likes him, yes. But
I don't believe she's serious.

707
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,790
Why not?

708
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,950
Lady Mary has quite a
sense of her own importance

709
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,950
and I doubt he's enough for her.

710
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,280
Besides, what would he do here?

711
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,630
Hang about, testing his cars on the drive?

712
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,990
He could always get a job.

713
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,230
Doing what?

714
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I'm not convinced there's a big
demand for racing drivers in Thirsk.

715
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,360
So, Lady Mary does not believe
that love conquers all?

716
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,910
We mustn't be hard on
her. She is what she is.

717
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,840
But I'd say she'll want someone who
brings just as much to the table.

718
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,150
Maybe I'm wrong.

719
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,590
I hope so. I'd like her to be happy.

720
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,360
I'm happy, and I want
everyone to be happy.

721
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,710
Are you really happy?

722
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,590
I'm happier than I have ever been.

723
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
Happy, impatient, excited.

724
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,910
Don't say too much.

725
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,350
It frightens me.

726
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,310
We've still got months.

727
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,670
Nothing will go wrong.

728
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,510
Bad harvest, bad harvest.

729
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,760
What does that mean?

730
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:13,000
In the old days, when the crop was good,
the farmers used to shout "Bad harvest!",

731
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,760
so the gods wouldn't grow jealous
of their luck and destroy them.

732
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,400
Bad harvest!

733
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,950
That ought to do it.

734
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,920
Let's hope so.

735
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
We'd better hurry or we'll
be late for breakfast.

736
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,470
- Well? - She wants
you. In the drawing room.

737
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,790
What did she say?

738
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,910
What did you say?

739
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,680
I told her your crime was
an excess of loyalty,

740
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,640
that your devotion to
her had made you blind.

741
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,520
It was the smugness of the
doctor that got my goat.

742
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,270
That, I did not say.

743
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,040
No, no. The point is, did it work?

744
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,280
I reminded her how hard it is to
find properly trained staff now.

745
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,590
Yeah. And did it work?

746
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,030
I asked her how long it
had taken to break you in.

747
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,830
We'll have less of that talk.

748
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,400
I just want to know, did it work?

749
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,040
She's going to give you one more chance.

750
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,110
Hallelujah!

751
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,590
But mind you, act surprised
when she tells you.

752
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,360
I will rival Saint Paul
in my astonishment.

753
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,830
Right.

754
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,320
Well, you better get upstairs.

755
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,510
Oh, and Miss Denker,

756
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,360
I don't want to hear another
mention of my unfortunate nephew.

757
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,080
Oh, well, that rather depends.

758
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,190
- On what?
- On whether or not

759
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,380
I need to mention him again.

760
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,190
He's not arrived, then?

761
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,710
No, not yet.

762
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,680
But what we want to know is, by
what power you made him come here.

763
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,630
Well, power of personality.

764
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,230
I'm not sure it would've worked for me.

765
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,080
Works for me. Are you quite well?

766
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,160
I will be all right as long
as no one asks me how I am.

767
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,950
You heard your note nearly
proved fatal to poor Denker?

768
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,910
Well, I only intended that she
be ticked off, not beheaded.

769
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,560
I gather it was Spratt who saved her,
which is a surprise in any number of ways.

770
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,760
Mama, what are you doing?

771
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,080
Carson, Carson, can you change these
place cards in the dining room?

772
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,350
- I'm not sure her ladyship...
- Robert?

773
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,440
- Just do it.
- Yes, very well, m'lord.

774
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,230
You'll be in a very junior seat.

775
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Il faut reculer pour mieux sauter.

776
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,110
I found my editor.

777
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,270
And had some fun, too, I hope.

778
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,560
I went dancing at the Cafe de Paris,
which felt very young and gay.

779
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,030
And we saw Henry Talbot
try out a racing car.

780
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,750
So, now we're all members
of the Bright Young Things.

781
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,230
I don't know about "bright."

782
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,110
The Right Honourable Neville Chamberlain,

783
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,510
Minister for Health.

784
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
Lord Grantham. Lady Grantham.

785
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,200
Minister, how kind of you to find
time for us in your busy schedule.

786
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,830
We're very grateful.

787
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,190
I wouldn't have the courage
to refuse your mother-in-law.

788
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,840
There you are.

789
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,720
How is dear Anne?

790
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,190
She sends her greetings.

791
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,640
Oh, how grown up you all are.

792
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,960
You know, I remember so well when
you and she were young and carefree,

793
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,470
looking for fun wherever
you could find it.

794
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,950
I know you do.

795
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,920
Yes, well, but I always say,
let the past stay in the past.

796
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,940
I always say that, too.

797
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,400
Have you met my cousin Mrs Crawley?

798
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,190
No, indeed. It's a great honour.

799
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,040
I gather you're here to discuss the
new plans for managing our health.

800
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,880
I know I'm here to discuss a topic
Lady Grantham is interested in.

801
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,700
Excuse me, would you
care for one of these?

802
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,670
Thank you.

803
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,670
I thought you needed rescuing.

804
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,270
Our own scrapes are bad enough without
being dragged into other people's.

805
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,710
How well you understand me.

806
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,470
I'm afraid you're in for
some rigorous debate.

807
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,190
I wish I weren't.

808
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Shall we go in?

809
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,720
We don't want to wear the minister out
before he's even had a chance to sit down.

810
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,030
She can't protect him in the dining room.

811
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,480
You'll stop at nothing to get
your own way. Isn't that the truth?

812
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,000
Indeed.

813
00:37:55,080 --> 00:38:01,240
It is a quality I share with Marlborough,
Wellington and my late mother.

814
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,680
I was trained in a hard school

815
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,200
and I fight accordingly.

816
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
No, he's a coming man. I've read
he may be prime minister one day.

817
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,110
Well, he's no friend of the unions.

818
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,990
For which he is to be congratulated.

819
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,110
Is the consomme ready, Mrs Patmore?

820
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,360
We should get out of your way.

821
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,100
You never said how the trial went.

822
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,710
I didn't have to testify in the end.

823
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,800
He looked at the list of
witnesses and changed his plea.

824
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,390
You must have a sense
of unfinished business.

825
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,270
That's clever of you.

826
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,120
I won't ask what it was, but I
hope you can leave it behind.

827
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm not sure. But thank you.

828
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,320
Mr Molesley says the Dowager's
got the bit between her teeth.

829
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,630
Then I don't give much for
Mr Chamberlain's chances.

830
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,680
- Nor me. - But surely, if
it's important to the area,

831
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,470
he'll want to listen?

832
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,860
He'll just want to get out alive.

833
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,110
The system has worked well
here for a hundred years!

834
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,160
Why must we destroy everything in our
path simply for the sake of change?

835
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,280
I'm not sure that's a true
representation of the case.

836
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,110
Exactly. There are many
benefits to be had from the plan.

837
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,590
But benefits for whom?

838
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,750
Goodness.

839
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,960
I thought I was here to be
lectured by a united group,

840
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,710
not to witness a battle royal.

841
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,100
Oh! Don't you enjoy a good fight?

842
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,470
I'm not sure I do, really.

843
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,440
My mother-in-law has a certain myopia when
it comes to anyone else's point of view.

844
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,230
On the contrary, I have
a clarity of vision

845
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,160
that allows me to resist a
housemaid's trap of sentimentality.

846
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,470
Your enthusiasm is getting
the better of your manners.

847
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,270
Can't we stop this beastly row?

848
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,670
How I wish we could.

849
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,830
Because I...

850
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,280
I...

851
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,960
I'm so sorry...

852
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,990
Thomas, on his left side.

853
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,470
Give me napkins!

854
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,790
I'll call the ambulance.

855
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,390
- Keep him warm.
- Take my coat.

856
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,230
- What is it?
- His ulcer has burst.

857
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,630
- What?
- Will he be all right?

858
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,710
We must get him to hospital
as quickly as we can.

859
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,240
I'm here, darling, don't worry.

860
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,440
If this is it, just know I
have loved you very, very much.

861
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,150
This isn't it, darling.
Don't... We won't let this be it.

862
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,400
- Some water?
- No! No water.

863
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,280
Just keep him steady until
the ambulance arrives.

864
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,530
Is he very bad?

865
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,610
I've rung for the ambulance.
It'll be here at any moment.

866
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,620
Miss Baxter, Anna, fetch
their ladyships' coats.

867
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,850
- Don't forget Lady Edith.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

868
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,370
You might put together some
things that could be useful.

869
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,730
But hurry, there's no time to lose.

870
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,340
I can't believe it.

871
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,820
Life is short, death is sure.

872
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,700
That is all we know.

873
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,690
There is a man who's been
shaken to the roots of his soul.

874
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,140
Everything he based his life
on has proved mortal, after all.

875
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,730
We've no time for philosophy, Mrs Patmore.

876
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,250
What can we do to help?

877
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,370
Let's send up some coffee.

878
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,610
Lady Grantham, I'm not sure
how much use I can be here.

879
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,250
Of course, you should go.

880
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,730
I will consider the new plan.

881
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,180
Don't. That is, let it stand.

882
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,250
I believe the change will work
well for both establishments.

883
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,610
Very well.

884
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,770
- Lady Grantham.
- Give my love to dear Annie.

885
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,090
I will.

886
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,490
The ambulance is here!

887
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,210
Don't reprimand me, Mama, I think
the new system will be better

888
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,290
and I haven't got time to be diplomatic.

889
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,930
Don't you think I have
enough things to worry about?

890
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,170
It's better we should be honest.
There've been too many secrets.

891
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,700
Let's have no more of them.

892
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,260
If you mean Marigold, that's
settled and you know I am sorry.

893
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,330
Now let us concentrate on Robert?

894
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,050
They're ready. They want to take him now.

895
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,460
Girls. Mary. Edith.

896
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,010
We must go!

897
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,300
Edith, dear, telephone with any news.

898
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,650
- No matter how late.
- I will.

899
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,610
I'll take you home in my
car. And Lady Grantham.

900
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,130
In a moment.

901
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,290
You're quite pale.

902
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,010
We'll go together.

903
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,530
You've had a shock.

904
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:11,500
I think I've had a few
shocks this evening.

905
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,660
- They're bringing your car round.
- Oh, let the ambulance get away.

906
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,690
There's a dinner that delivered
more than you bargained for.

907
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,530
Are you going to follow them?

908
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,330
I don't want to crowd him, but
they'll ring when they have news.

909
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,010
Can you let my office know?

910
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,460
Of course.

911
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,490
If you'll do me a favour
and answer one question.

912
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,530
Why did you come here tonight?

913
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,540
Your grandmother-in-law
can be very persuasive.

914
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,610
I'd love to know how she did it.

915
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,210
My wife has a brother
called Horace de Vere Cole.

916
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,010
- You may have heard of him.
- The prankster?

917
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,220
Didn't he board a warship pretending to
be the leader of a Turkish delegation?

918
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,930
Abyssinian, but yes.

919
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,330
He was always doing that sort of thing.

920
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,780
Some years ago, he and a few friends
dug a trench across Piccadilly

921
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,400
and London was thrown into total chaos.

922
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:11,540
- But what --
- I was one of the chaps responsible.

923
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,490
We dressed as workmen
and no one stopped us.

924
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:16,010
And by the time we'd finished
every road was jammed

925
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,330
from the East End to Belgrave Square.

926
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,410
And old Lady Grantham
threatened to give you away?

927
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,460
It was long ago now,

928
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,020
but the papers would be sure to
make it look as bad as possible

929
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,740
and a dinner seemed a price
worth paying to avert it.

930
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,020
And there's my car.

931
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,580
So, I'd better be off.

932
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,740
Thank you, m'lady.

933
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,500
That was Lady Mary.

934
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,620
His lordship's had his
operation and now he's resting.

935
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,490
Her ladyship is staying overnight,

936
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,970
but Lady Mary and Lady
Edith will come home.

937
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,420
- What was the operation?
- They performed a gastrectomy.

938
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,970
What's that?

939
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,210
No business of ours.

940
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,090
Will he be all right?

941
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,330
It sounds as if he has a good chance.

942
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,020
Thank God.

943
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,170
I'll find out if there's
anything he needs in the morning.

944
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,450
I'll walk down there now with
some things for her ladyship.

945
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,210
I'll come with you.

946
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,850
I'm quite relieved.

947
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,930
Of course you are.

948
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,980
No, I didn't think I'd mind one
way or the other, to be honest.

949
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,220
I must be getting soft in my old age.

950
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,890
Well, don't let the other animals
find out, or they'll pounce.

951
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,460
Leave him alone. Now, we should go.

952
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,220
We can take it in turns tomorrow.
So Mama can have some rest.

953
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,570
Very well.

954
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,700
I'll go first. Stark can take
me there and bring Mama back.

955
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,570
What a terrifying reminder.

956
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,850
In one second your whole life can change.

957
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,040
Yes.

958
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,660
It only takes a moment for
everything to feel quite different.

959
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,890
I'm going to check on the children.

960
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,680
Of course you are.

961
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,930
Good night.

962
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,490
How is he?

963
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:41,050
He'll be all right, but it's
knocked the stuffing out of him.

964
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,610
We'll have to make sure the load
is lightened when he comes home.

965
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,600
To be more precise, Tom,

966
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,540
from now on you and I need to take
full responsibility for the estate.

967
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,090
We'll involve him in the
big decisions of course,

968
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,290
but he mustn't have any more worry.

969
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,850
It's why he got the
ulcer in the first place.

970
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,170
So long live our own Queen Mary.

971
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,370
Good night.

972
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,290
Mr Carson told us his
lordship is going to recover.

973
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,730
They seem to think so.

974
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,610
Everyone was very happy to hear it.

975
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,450
Can I fetch you anything?

976
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,820
I just want to go to bed.

977
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,980
- You must be absolutely
exhausted. - Hmm.

978
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,660
Anna, can I ask you something?

979
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,220
Is there any talk in the servants'
hall about Miss Marigold?

980
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,450
What sort of talk, m'lady?

981
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:39,460
Well, everyone thinks she's a lucky
little girl, being taken in by the family.

982
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,610
But they would think that.

983
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,770
And that's all you want to say?

984
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,860
Why? What else should I say?

985
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,660
Never mind.

986
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:53,420
I'm too tired to talk any more tonight.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

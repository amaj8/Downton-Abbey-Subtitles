1
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,070
You didn't quarrel, then?

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,110
No. My cousin was good to me.

3
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,870
But in the end it was another country

4
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,670
and I'd moved away one time too many.

5
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,110
And besides, I'd taken
Sybbie away from you.

6
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,750
What right had I to do that?

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,990
You had every right.
But it did seem a shame.

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,910
I wish we had a photograph of all
our faces when you walked in.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,950
- I hope I didn't steal
their thunder. - Oh, no.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,230
I think it gave it an added lift.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,670
- How was Sybbie this morning?
- Tired.

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,550
But glad to be here.

13
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,790
What will you do, Mary,
now that Tom's home?

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,950
Exactly what I was doing. Why?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,870
Well, surely he'll go
back to being the agent.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,470
Can't we allow Tom a few days to
settle in before we start fighting?

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,510
You'll get no fight from me. I want
to do what's right for everyone.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,190
Come down to the office later
and I'll bring you up to date.

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,510
Any word from Carson?

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,670
He rang to say they'd arrived
safely, m'lord, but that's all.

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,830
He could have managed something
a little better than Scarborough.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,790
I offered, but that's what they wanted.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,830
- When do we expect Rosamund?
- Tomorrow, for dinner.

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,990
- Why's she coming?
- She says just to see us

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,190
but I'm sure she wants to get stuck
in with the row about the hospital.

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,910
At least she'll be reinforcements
for Cora and Isobel.

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,400
- Do you think she'll take their side?
- Against Granny? Every time.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,150
Miss Baxter, Sergeant Willis rang
earlier. He wants to look in.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,190
- What's this?
- The sergeant is coming in later.

30
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,710
- What for?
- To see Miss Baxter.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,070
Oh, that's her Ladyship.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,120
I must go.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,070
What do the police want with Miss Baxter?

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,310
- Makes a nice change.
- Good to know we can joke about it.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,350
Well, it's no joke to Miss Baxter.

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,710
- Who spoke to him?
- Sergeant Willis?

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,110
- Me, I did. - Next time
run it past me, Mrs Patmore,

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,070
before you issue an invitation.
I am the butler now.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,350
For the next five minutes.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,030
Until Mr Carson gets back.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,150
And don't let's forget it.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,790
When did this arrive?

43
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,630
Mr Spratt walked up with it
first thing this morning, m'lady.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,110
Lady Grantham wants to
bring Lady Shackleton

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,550
- when she comes for dinner tomorrow.
- That's nice.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,470
Is it? It's only so dear Mama has
an ally when we start fighting.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,640
She thinks Lady Rosamund and
Mrs Crawley are on my side.

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,710
Hey-ho. I'll telephone when I go down.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,950
Now we're out of Edith's
earshot, what do you really want?

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,150
To be joint agents? I wouldn't mind.

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,470
Maybe. But if I am to
live out my life here,

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,470
I need to find something to do
that isn't just about the estate.

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,990
- How enterprising.
- I've changed since I've been away.

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm still not a traditionalist. The
King should not rely on my support.

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,750
Which wouldn't surprise Papa.

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,870
But I don't feel the
same about capitalism.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,550
Not American capitalism, anyway.

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,670
Where a hardworking man
can go right to the top

59
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,350
all the way in a single lifetime.

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,350
- Which still isn't true here.
- Not yet.

61
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,750
But I have a sense it's going to change
and in the not-too-distant future.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,990
- I hope that doesn't worry you.
- Tom, you're my brother.

63
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,430
I want what you want. In
your work, in your life.

64
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,750
No more Miss Buntings
if you have any pity.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,550
But even in that, don't
please us. Please yourself.

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,630
What about you? Have you regretted
dismissing your suitors?

67
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,680
No.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,910
Come in here. Mr Carson won't mind.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,750
- Good morning, Miss Baxter.
- Is this about the Bates?

71
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,750
No, no, no. It's not about the Bates.

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,470
They're off the hook.

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,150
Then what's Miss Baxter done
if it's not to do with them?

74
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,670
Would you rather I questioned
you alone, Miss Baxter?

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,710
Mrs Hughes wouldn't like it.

76
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,750
I've asked Mr Molesley to be with
me if I'm allowed. He's outside.

77
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,310
Oh. Well, of course. If I'm not wanted...

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,350
- It's not --
- I understand.

79
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I understand.

80
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
Go on.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,910
I won't beat about the bush, Miss Baxter.

82
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,230
You'll know who I mean by Mr Peter Coyle.

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,470
Yes, I do.

84
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,550
He's currently on bail for theft.
That doesn't seem to surprise you.

85
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,830
- Correct. - He's accused
alongside a young woman

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,190
who worked in the same house,

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,150
and I'm afraid that most of the
evidence will count against her.

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,430
Again, you do not surprise me.

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,470
Well, this is it.

90
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,790
He's pleading innocence
but our records show

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,630
that while he's never been convicted,

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,870
he's been close to several
crimes in the past.

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,510
Always carried out by women and
he's escaped prosecution every time.

94
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,830
We know he worked in the same house as you

95
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,630
and that he left on the day that you
stole the jewels from your mistress.

96
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,550
- That's true.
- And those jewels were never found

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,510
and you've kept silent.

98
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,550
But we believe he profited from the theft.

99
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,840
We want you to testify to that
effect as a character witness.

100
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,350
We're only trying to protect
vulnerable young women

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
from him in the future.

102
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,470
He's ruined several lives.

103
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,310
I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.
Please consider my request.

104
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,710
Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,710
Then I'll er, take the
liberty of calling again.

106
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,760
Goodbye.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,200
I dare say this... Mr
Coyle was a handsome devil.

108
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
He was a devil all right.

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
I know it's not my decision,
but I think you should do it.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,240
You don't know what you're asking.

111
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,590
"All that's needed for evil to triumph

112
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,840
is that good men do nothing."

113
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,390
You won't believe this, except you will.

114
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,870
Lady Shackleton would love to
come, but can she bring her nephew?

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,350
What?

116
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,110
He's in Yorkshire for some reason
and he's only staying one night.

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,030
- What did you say?
- I didn't want to put Mama's back up.

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,150
Things are bad enough without that.

119
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,190
Mama is an old intriguer.

120
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,270
She will use tears or
terror with equal facility.

121
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,310
Who is this man?

122
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,630
I don't know. Her sister's son.

123
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,310
Mrs Cobb is going to live
with her daughter in Oswaldkirk

124
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,510
- so Mary's going to give the cottage
to the Carsons. - Excellent news.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,190
Can we discuss Yew Tree Farm?

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,910
- What about it? - I don't see
why we can't get a new tenant

127
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,110
- when the Drewes are gone.
- No, Mary's right.

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,110
It makes more sense for
us to take it over.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,030
- We could let the house, of course.
- But we will have some tenants.

130
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,750
Which reminds me, I want to
see Fairclough's new planting.

131
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
- Tom, do you fancy a walk?
- Let me make a call and then I'll be with you.

132
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,750
You're happy he's back, aren't you?

133
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,350
I really am. Funny, isn't it?

134
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,310
- What are the new maids like?
- Nice. Hard-working.

135
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,870
But they don't live in.

136
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,030
And they go home before we have our
tea so we don't really know them.

137
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,830
Not in the old way.

138
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,230
Miss Baxter and I turn the
beds down in the evenings.

139
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,830
I hope you're not working too hard.

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,910
I feel quite well, m'lady.
Though I'm thickening up.

141
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,430
I saw Mr Bates eyeing me the other day.

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,470
He'll think I ate all the pies.

143
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,070
- So you still haven't told him?
- When I know it'll be fine,

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
he can celebrate without worrying.

145
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,310
Ah, we were just talking about you.

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,590
Good things I hope, m'lady.

147
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,270
I wanted Molesley and Andrews
to take the cases down.

148
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,310
- They've both gone
into the village. - Both?

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,230
- Carson wouldn't allow that.
- When the cat's away, m'lady.

150
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,270
Can you manage?

151
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,590
Anna and I can take one each.

152
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,990
No, they're too heavy for Anna to lift.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,390
Then I'll make a double journey.

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,800
Rather a bore for you. The car's
waiting in the stableyard.

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,470
It was sweet of them
to let me bring Henry.

156
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,950
Though why couldn't he stay
behind with a tray on his lap?

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,470
Don't be unkind. I never see him.

158
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,110
He's only up here now to look
at some horrid racing car.

159
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,950
- Does he get on with Philip?
- They were friends as boys.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,230
I'm afraid she doesn't
like my daughter-in-law.

161
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,430
- Oh, dear.
- Who does?

162
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,870
Now, you understand the job on hand?

163
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,150
We're to persuade Lady Grantham to
oppose all change at the hospital.

164
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,430
No, no, not quite.

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,190
To oppose change that
takes control away from us.

166
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,030
It would be so bad for the village.

167
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,910
Forgive me, but why, if it means
more modern and varied treatment?

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,990
How could the interests of
the village be protected

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,190
if every decision is made in York?

170
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,230
I see that, my dear --

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,950
Are you... are you here
to help or irritate?

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,280
- To help, of course.
- Then there's no more to be said.

173
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,270
I'd like some volunteers to clean
Mrs Cobb's cottage for the Carsons.

174
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,790
His Lordship wants it
done before they get back.

175
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,350
I don't mind. I could go up
with the maids in the morning.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,510
It's a shame they can't
live in their own home.

177
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,830
The builders are still in it.

178
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,030
And they can't get there
and back without a car

179
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,150
which is a bit revolutionary
for Mr Carson.

180
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
"The Carsons."

181
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,630
Are we gonna have to
call her "Mrs Carson"?

182
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,430
I wish I knew how long Mr Mason's
got to wait for his farmhouse.

183
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,990
Is this Yew Tree Farm
you're talking about?

184
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,830
Mr Mason's taking over the lease.

185
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,750
I don't believe so. They're going
to farm the land themselves.

186
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,070
They may let the house, but that's it.

187
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,470
- What are you talking about?
- I heard them discussing it yesterday

188
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,510
- at breakfast.
- Don't say it.

189
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,870
They couldn't turn around
like that, could they?

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,230
- But they've not said they'll do it.
- They implied it.

191
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,830
She implied it.

192
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,790
I might go to Mrs Cobb's
cottage when they're changing.

193
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,180
- I'll come with you.
- No need.

194
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,350
I expect he's got
something to think through.

195
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,900
Keep your pity, Mr Molesley.
You need it more than I do.

196
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,070
You don't have to tell me
your mother's in the right.

197
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,470
We can't have a public quarrel

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,790
or they'll both be asked
to resign from the board

199
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,630
- and even I don't want that.
- Which means I'm not to make Granny

200
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,510
any angrier than she is already.

201
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,710
So how are you? What's the news?

202
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,470
I do have some as a matter of fact.

203
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,670
Have you heard of a place called
Hillcroft? It's in Turperton.

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,470
- What sort of place?
- A college.

205
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,630
For women from modest backgrounds.
But clever women with potential.

206
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,630
- I'm a trustee.
- How interesting.

207
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,910
I knew you'd think so.

208
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,230
So I'm going to suggest
you as a trustee, too.

209
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,150
Oddly enough, our treasurer lives up here.

210
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,910
It's one of the reasons I've come,

211
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,910
so I can meet him while I'm at
Downton. We'll ask him over.

212
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,670
What's his name?

213
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,790
John Harding. I like the sound of him.

214
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,070
Self-made, clever, successful.

215
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,440
And nearer your age than mine.

216
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,110
Might I have a word, m'lady?

217
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,830
You'll have to be quick, I'm late.

218
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,950
It's about Miss Baxter.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,990
I hope this isn't gossip.

220
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,240
I don't believe it is, m'lady.

221
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,950
You couldn't be harder on those potatoes

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,950
if you wanted them to confess to spying.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,790
I feel so let down.

224
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,310
They've got Mr Mason's hopes up,
let him think he had a future

225
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,030
- and now what?
- To be honest, Daisy,

226
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,750
wasn't it you that put his hopes up?

227
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,030
Only because I was sure
that's what she intended.

228
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,630
- She's led me on.
- Maybe it just wasn't possible.

229
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,190
Not possible? Don't
give me 'not possible'.

230
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,840
All right, Madame Defarge,
calm down and finish that mash.

231
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,950
The Dowager Lady Shackleton
and Mr Henry Talbot.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,030
- Ah.
- Golly.

233
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,910
Nobody told me the nephew was you.

234
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,910
Oh, is that what I am? "The nephew".

235
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,070
You never said your
aunt was Lady Shackleton.

236
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,870
Did you know she was bringing you here?

237
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,910
One must be allowed some secrets.

238
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,710
Of course we'll invite Mr Harding.

239
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,630
He has a wife. We must ask her, too.

240
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,110
It's marvellous for ordinary women
to aim at rich and fulfilling careers.

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,630
They talk about making a difference
but this could actually change lives.

242
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,510
- Why are you in Yorkshire?
- Mainly looking at a car

243
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,310
- I might be racing at Brooklands.
- So you really are a car man?

244
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,350
I wasn't sure how much you meant it.

245
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,310
Oh, I really am a car man.

246
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,070
That's not a claim you often
hear in this neck of the woods.

247
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,310
- Did you say you race at Brooklands?
- Yes, I've driven there quite a lot.

248
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,350
I don't envy much, but I envy that.

249
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,630
What sort of Talbot is he?

250
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,310
Shrewsbury. But he's
nowhere near the earldom.

251
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,590
About 40 strong men
would have to drop dead.

252
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,230
Well, nothing is impossible.

253
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,670
Without it, what are his prospects?

254
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,710
Adequate, but not overwhelming.

255
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,910
Honestly, listen to yourselves.

256
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,950
Lady Shackleton is quite right.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,230
Mary needs more than a handsome
smile and a hand on the gear stick.

258
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,390
I'm surprised you know
what a gear stick is.

259
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,680
I know more than you think.

260
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,510
It's very kind of you to let me and
Henry push into a family party.

261
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,270
In return, please don't let
Mama pull you into the fight.

262
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,990
Really, Robert? You paint
me as such a schemer.

263
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,070
No-one has sharper eyes than a loving son.

264
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,870
You read that somewhere.

265
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,860
Why do you never think
I can make anything up?

266
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,630
Didn't you trust your own
powers of persuasion?

267
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,150
- What? - Don't pretend. Who else
would her Ladyship have heard it from?

268
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,800
I think you'll regret being silent.

269
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,550
Come along, Mr Molesley.

270
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,640
Just because Mr Carson's away...

271
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,710
You look very preoccupied.

272
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Anna?

273
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,710
- Can I help?
- I'm fine.

274
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Just carry on, as they say in the navy.

275
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,350
The treatments available to the village

276
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,790
would be vastly superior to
anything we can lay claim to now.

277
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,070
You are making a grave mistake

278
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,870
and impoverishing the village by doing so.

279
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Prudence, tell them.

280
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,030
I expect there's a good deal
to be said on both sides.

281
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,510
Don't be so feeble!

282
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,750
How can I present myself as an
expert when I don't know the facts?

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,790
It's never stopped me!

284
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,350
- She's still on cracking form.
- If she were 20 years younger,

285
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,390
you'd just call her a tyrant.

286
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,470
Have you thought more about what
you're going to do now you're back?

287
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,870
Before dinner, Mr Talbot was
saying he works with cars.

288
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,990
I wonder if that mightn't be right for me.

289
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,270
- Not as a racing car driver?
- Maybe not.

290
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,790
- But in that world.
- Which is a long way from Downton.

291
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,150
Your attitude is hardly conducive
to a peaceful settlement.

292
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,910
I won't explain, since every
village argument is the same.

293
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,550
Really? I'm not a village boy.

294
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,950
My father was in Parliament
so we lived in London.

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,030
Except for the summer
and then we'd shelter

296
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,190
- with various hunting, shooting
and fishing relations. - That's us.

297
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,640
- Yes, but it's not all you are.
- So do you make a living out of cars?

298
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,070
Yes, I suppose I do,
yes. I race on a team.

299
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,790
- Does that seem very odd?
- Quite odd.

300
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,110
- Although people do such
odd things nowadays. - Mm.

301
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,870
I once met a man who spent his time
importing guinea pigs from Peru.

302
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,630
Don't hide behind Lady Shackleton, Mama.

303
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,990
You're quite capable of
landing your own punches.

304
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,310
The question is which system is more
likely to deliver modern treatment

305
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,910
- to the local population?
- That is not the point.

306
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,190
I should have thought
that was exactly the point.

307
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,030
You've muddled your priorities!

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,830
I suppose cousin Isobel is
entitled to put up an argument.

309
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,080
Of course she is, she's
just not entitled to win it.

310
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,870
I'm afraid I've been rather a
disappointment to your mother.

311
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,110
Not to me. You could have
made things even worse.

312
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,750
So, do you ever make it up to London?

313
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,670
- Sometimes.
- Would you think it terribly common

314
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,270
- if I gave you my card?
- Fairly common.

315
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,310
But I'll take it anyway.

316
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,950
Telephone me. We'll have lunch or a drink.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Or something.

318
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,710
Do you know, I couldn't
be less interested in cars

319
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,750
if I took a pill to achieve it.

320
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,300
Well, that's because you
haven't been taught about them.

321
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,030
Properly.

322
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,430
The main thing I want to avoid is
Granny being kicked off the board

323
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,150
- of the new arrangement.
- We'll all be kicked off

324
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,470
- with the fuss we're making.
- Supporting her wrong thinking won't help.

325
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,670
Can I put in a word for
trying to remain friends?

326
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,270
Tom the peacemaker is back.

327
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,710
That's really the purpose of it --

328
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,870
Aunt Prudence. We're
outstaying our welcome.

329
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,470
- Indeed. Goodnight, Robert.
- Goodnight.

330
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,630
- Goodnight, Mary.
- Goodnight. Mr Talbot.

331
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Lady Mary.

332
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,150
Not that pain again?

333
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,340
I can't drink port any more.

334
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Oh, darling...

335
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I don't think I've ever felt
such a lack... of reason.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What do you mean, reason?

337
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,150
Why am I here? What am I doing?

338
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
What are we all doing?

339
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,510
Trying to get through life as best we can.

340
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,110
Yes, but you, you make friends.

341
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,310
People like you. Her Ladyship likes you.

342
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,310
Mr Molesley more than likes you.

343
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,350
Don't be silly.

344
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,600
It's true. I'm quite envious.

345
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,750
Not of Mr Molesley, but the rest of it.

346
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,790
And I envy you. You don't
care what people say.

347
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,760
While I tremble at the mere
idea of public ridicule.

348
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,870
I should be used to it by now, but...

349
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,960
You are stronger than you think.

350
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,990
And you're wrong about me.

351
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I mind what people say.

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,030
It's no use talking as if you can
force me. We both know you can't.

353
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,750
We can make you attend the trial.

354
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,190
Come on. Sergeant Willis is not the enemy.

355
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,910
Mr Coyle is the enemy
and here's your chance.

356
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,150
Chance for what? Revenge?
Much good that will do.

357
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,110
Not for revenge. To stop other girls
being tricked into a life of crime.

358
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,950
Two of the women he
used are prostitutes now.

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
At least one is dead. Do
you want him to go on?

360
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,080
If I say yes, what happens next?

361
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,790
We send a list of witnesses
to the prosecution.

362
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,270
It's not a Penny Dreadful
with confessions from the box.

363
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,390
They see who will testify on our side.

364
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,520
If he won't change his plea,
he'll go to the trial.

365
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,040
- Very well.
- Thank you, Miss Baxter.

366
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,020
I'll keep you informed at every step.

367
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,070
What changed your mind?

368
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,350
The thought of the girls he ruined.

369
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,390
Like he ruined me.

370
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,710
Oh, but he hasn't ruined you, has he?

371
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,470
And the proof is you're standing here.

372
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,520
Maybe.

373
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
But he changed me.

374
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,750
I've just seen the Hardings' car.
We'll be in the drawing room.

375
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Certainly, m'lady.

376
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,390
- Hello.
- I believe we're expected.

377
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
Of course, Mr and Mrs Harding.

378
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,350
Would you like to leave your coats?

379
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,230
- Gwen?
- Anna?

380
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,270
It is you, isn't it?

381
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,590
Why didn't you telephone
and say you were coming?

382
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,550
I didn't know we were until
this morning or I would have.

383
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,750
He said we were visiting
somebody called Painswick.

384
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,910
Lady Rosamund Painswick.
His Lordship's sister.

385
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I'd forgotten that.

386
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,980
I'll see you later if I can.

387
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,750
She hasn't got time to greet
her old friends, then.

388
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,520
When were you a friend of Gwen's?

389
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,270
We're so pleased to see you. I
want to hear all about Hillcroft.

390
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,030
Why did you first get involved?

391
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,950
Naturally I'd be happy to take
as much of the credit as possible,

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,910
but it was really Mrs Harding's idea.

393
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,350
What was it that drew you
to the work they were doing?

394
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,390
Forgive me, but have we met?

395
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,310
Er, I don't think we've met exactly.

396
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,350
Tell us more about Hillcroft.

397
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,070
You see, I never had any
higher education and so --

398
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,350
Who did? All we were taught was
French prejudice and dance steps.

399
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,230
- Who's Gwen? - She was
housemaid here before the war.

400
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,990
She got away to be a secretary.

401
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,190
Now she's having lunch upstairs
while we're still stuck down here.

402
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,950
- What does his Lordship think?
- They won't recognise her.

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,630
- They don't look us in the face enough.
- I wonder if Karl Marx

404
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,030
- might finish the liver pate (?)
- I don't think his Lordship will mind.

405
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,430
He's not uncomfortable
about that sort of thing.

406
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,670
It won't bother him that
she used to work here.

407
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,390
Well, his daughter ran off with
a chauffeur in the interim.

408
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,870
And Mrs Harding was a supporter
when Hillcroft first opened in 1920.

409
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,350
Then later they needed a
treasurer, so she suggested me.

410
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,510
And how do you manage from Yorkshire?

411
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,790
It's not hard. I go there twice a month.

412
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,190
But the telephone's
really changed everything.

413
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,710
I want to hear Mrs Harding's story.

414
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,430
It was the telephone that
changed everything for me, too.

415
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,830
You see, I was a secretary
before I was married

416
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,750
for a telephone company back when
everyone was getting connected

417
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,590
- at the start of the war.
- Then she moved into local government

418
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,230
and that's where we met.

419
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,790
But if I'd had more education,
I might have gone further.

420
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,110
If that doesn't sound too vain.

421
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,110
No. Many women from all backgrounds
feel that. I know I did.

422
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,430
I was a nurse, but why
couldn't I be a doctor?

423
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,350
- Barrow, is that luncheon?
- It is, m'lady.

424
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,710
- Shall we go in? - I hope we'll have
a chance to continue this conversation.

425
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,830
- Look at you.
- I don't mean to pretend.

426
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,830
I didn't know we were coming to Downton

427
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,910
- until we turned into the drive.
- Does he not know you worked here?

428
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,670
He knows I was a housemaid,
so there's no pretence.

429
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,470
But by the time we met
that was all in the past.

430
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I'm one to talk. I married
the boss's daughter.

431
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,870
So is she going to come down?

432
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,350
I don't know, she didn't say.

433
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,030
No, she's too important to
speak to the likes of us.

434
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Take those up now.

435
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,430
We have to find ladders to help
them achieve their potential.

436
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,270
I do so agree.

437
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,430
We can't afford to waste working women

438
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,070
- by not educating them.
- It's lucky Carson isn't here.

439
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,710
Carson?

440
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,750
Our butler. He's a traditionalist.

441
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,320
You recall Mr Carson, madam, surely?

442
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,550
What do you mean, Barrow?

443
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,070
- Mrs Harding used to work here.
- What?

444
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,990
- She used to be a --
- Thank you, Mr Barrow.

445
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I can tell it.

446
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,270
I used to be a housemaid here for
a couple of years before the war.

447
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,390
Here? In this house?

448
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,190
I knew I'd seen your face.

449
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,230
Why didn't you say?

450
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,150
I don't know. Well, I was going to.

451
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,270
You had every opportunity.

452
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,350
You can take the pudding and
Andy can carry the cream.

453
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,110
How's it going?

454
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,470
- Mr Barrow just landed her in it.
- Deliberately?

455
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,950
He only told the table she
used to work here as a maid.

456
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,630
I knew he'd do something like that.

457
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,950
Of course. How could he resist?

458
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,670
We've been hearing that you spoiled
Gwen's luncheon. Good work (!)

459
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,630
I couldn't have known she was planning

460
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,190
- to lie her way through it.
- That's not it though, is it?

461
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,150
You resent her luck. You're jealous.

462
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,910
Jealous? Why?

463
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,670
Because I dedicated my life to service

464
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,910
and I'm about to be thrown out on my ear

465
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,070
when she scarpered first chance she got

466
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,110
and now she's lunching in the dining room?

467
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,750
Why would that make me jealous, Mr Bates?

468
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,910
His Lordship won't like it,
your trying to wrongfoot her.

469
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,590
Well, we'll see.

470
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,030
I know Lady Mary didn't
like being made a fool of.

471
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,390
Now in case I have to remind
you all again, I am the butler.

472
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
So please get on.

473
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,790
Seems marvellous to me you leave
service, go into government.

474
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,030
Now you're married to a prominent man.

475
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,350
- 20th century story.
- I agree. Welcome back.

476
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,990
I just feel stupid for
not recognising you.

477
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,430
Why should you? We never spoke.

478
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,510
You worked here for two years
and we never spoke to you.

479
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,950
- We're the ones in the wrong.
- No, I didn't mean it like that.

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,550
- It was a good job.
- But not good enough to stay.

481
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,030
I didn't want to be in
service my whole life.

482
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,350
- That's all. - So you found
an opportunity and took it.

483
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,070
- Bravo.
- I didn't find it.

484
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,710
Lady Sybil found it.

485
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,750
Sybil helped you?

486
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,790
Yes.

487
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,830
She did everything.

488
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,510
She looked out for the
jobs, lent me clothes,

489
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,190
drove me to the interviews.

490
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,830
One time I remember the horse went lame

491
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,870
and we both got stuck in the mud.

492
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,590
Oh, the talking we had
to do when we got back!

493
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,710
I remember we were so worried. But
she never said a thing about you.

494
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,750
It was our secret pact.

495
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,950
And then one day she cornered the man

496
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,790
who was installing the telephone here

497
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,150
and er, that's how I got
my first job in business.

498
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,630
She wouldn't let me enter the
library while you met him.

499
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,670
So that was you?

500
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,710
Did you keep in contact?

501
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,240
Christmas cards and such.

502
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,670
And then I heard the news.

503
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,670
I'll never forget her. Her
kindness changed my life.

504
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,120
What a lovely way to remember her.

505
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
She was a lovely person.

506
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Darling Sybil.

507
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,590
Thank you, Barrow, for reminding
us of Mrs Harding's time here.

508
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
My pleasure, m'lady.

509
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
They're coming now!

510
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,230
I just wanted to come and say hello.

511
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,870
Oh, Mrs Hughes will be sad to miss you.

512
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,510
Now, tell us about your children.

513
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,550
We want to know every detail.
Where are you living now?

514
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,150
All right. Well, let's
begin at the beginning.

515
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,350
But afterwards, I'd like
to hear all about you.

516
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,590
Mr Branson, I wouldn't
bother you but now you're back

517
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,230
- and now you're the agent again --
- Lady Mary's the agent.

518
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,310
But still, you'll know what they're
planning for Yew Tree Farm.

519
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,590
I suppose so.

520
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,030
Only, Mr Mason was in the running for it

521
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,230
but now it seems they've
had second thoughts.

522
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,030
It's not quite as simple as that.

523
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,070
Well, it's as simple as this.

524
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,950
His son, my husband, left this
house to die for his country.

525
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,470
Shouldn't we help him now if we can?

526
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll have a word.

527
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,990
I've an idea that when you mentioned
Mrs Harding's connection with us

528
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,670
you were trying to catch her out.

529
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,510
- Well, I -- - I don't like
to see such things, Barrow.

530
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,310
I don't care for a lack of
generosity. Do you understand me?

531
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Yes, m'lord.

532
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,070
You are your own worst enemy.

533
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,320
If I am, I've got competition.

534
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,990
Mrs Harding rather put me in
my place when she was here.

535
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,510
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

536
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,990
No. But when she was
talking about Lady Sybil

537
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,510
I had one of those moments
where you look at your life

538
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,030
and I realised how much
better Sybil was than I am.

539
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,990
- It was quite chastening.
- You're hard on yourself, m'lady.

540
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,150
Why did I have to be so pettish?
She'd made something of her life,

541
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,190
why shouldn't she?

542
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,680
Now, don't panic. Are you in pain?

543
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,470
I was then. A sharp pain.

544
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,520
I had it earlier.

545
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,870
I'm losing it. It's happening again.

546
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,590
We don't know that. Right,
we're going up to London.

547
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,790
I'll ring Dr Ryder, there'll
be a night telephone line.

548
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,830
But we've missed the last train.

549
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,790
We'll drive into York.
There may be a late train.

550
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,470
What do I tell Mr Bates? I
don't want to frighten him,

551
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,270
but I mustn't get his hopes up.

552
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,990
Tell him it's me, I need to
see a doctor double-quick.

553
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,350
What if I lose it on the way?

554
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,510
Then we'll be no worse
off than we are now.

555
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,150
But we'll make him see
you when we get there.

556
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,950
I don't care what time it is,
he'll come to Belgrave Square.

557
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,440
Now go, and meet me at the front.

558
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,830
- Why the suitcase?
- I'm racing up to London.

559
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,870
Whatever for? What's happened?

560
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,390
Don't tell anyone, but it's Anna.
She may be having a miscarriage.

561
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,030
How will you get there?

562
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,870
We've missed the last train from here

563
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,150
but if we drive into York
there may be a late one.

564
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,030
- If not, we'll get the milk train at dawn.
- I'll take you to York.

565
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,630
Remember, not a word to
anyone. Not even Bates.

566
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,950
She should tell him. But
anyway, I'll get the car.

567
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,990
Can I stay in Belgrave Square?

568
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,670
Of course. I'll telephone Mead.

569
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,590
- Haven't you missed the last train?
- Tom's driving us into York.

570
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,750
- Us?
- Anna.

571
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,830
- May we ask why?
- Something medical.

572
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,830
- Oh my lord. - I'm not in any
danger, but I need to go now.

573
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,270
I'll be back in a day or two.

574
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,350
- But what time will you get there?
- I'll get there when I get there.

575
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,390
Goodbye. I'll telephone tomorrow.

576
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,150
Carson and Mrs Hu -- Mrs
Carson will be back on Friday.

577
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,550
- It'd be nice if you were
to welcome them. - I'll try.

578
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
That's it, I must fly.

579
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,520
I don't understand the urgency.
Lady Mary didn't seem ill earlier.

580
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,990
- Do you want her medical history?
- No, but it seems so sudden.

581
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,440
Sometimes these things are sudden.

582
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,750
So you're not hiding anything?

583
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,710
You've lived with suspicion too
long. It's got under your skin.

584
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,350
I should get in. I mustn't
keep Mr Branson waiting.

585
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,140
- Before her Ladyship?
- Here she is now.

586
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,670
Good evening, Bates.

587
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,660
Don't worry, we'll be
back before you know it.

588
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,150
What's Lady Mary's emergency?

589
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,790
- It's none of our business.
- Very true, Miss Baxter.

590
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,910
For once I agree with you.

591
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,670
Daisy, what is it?

592
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,550
I've had enough. I don't
care what Mrs Patmore says.

593
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,430
Her Ladyship has cheated
Mr Mason of his farm

594
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,790
- and I'm going to have it out with her.
- Daisy, don't.

595
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,750
You'll lose your job and then what?

596
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,430
Look at Gwen. She's thrown off the
yoke of service to make a good life.

597
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,470
What am I doing with my mine?

598
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,030
- Why aren't you two up there now?
- They wanted to be alone.

599
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,950
We gave them coffee and they sent us off.

600
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,880
- You can't go barging in when they're
discussing something private. - I'll wait for
her.

601
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
I wish you wouldn't.

602
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,870
Poor Tom, racing across the county.
It's just Mary being dramatic.

603
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,150
She didn't look at all ill.

604
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,950
Well, why else would she have gone?

605
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,990
We'll ask her tomorrow morning.

606
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,270
I'd like to take advantage of her
absence to settle Yew Tree Farm.

607
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,430
I want to offer it to Mr Mason.

608
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,470
I know you do. But he's quite old.

609
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,350
- He'll have Daisy to help him.
- Can we afford it?

610
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,830
We'd make more money if we farmed
it ourselves and let the house.

611
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,310
Shouldn't we wait for Tom to
get back before we decide?

612
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,560
- I'll ask him what Sybil would do?
- Is that fair?

613
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,150
Daisy, I beg of you.

614
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,630
You're a trained cook, you
could get work anywhere.

615
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,350
But you'll have to manage without
a reference if you do this!

616
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,990
She's right, Daisy. Have
you forgotten what happened

617
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,070
- when you let off steam at the auction?
- No. I've had it up to here.

618
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,110
I've come to the end. I must do it.

619
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,790
Well, I'm coming with you.

620
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,150
- Please yourself. I'm going.
- Why? It won't help Mr Mason.

621
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,390
Listen to him, Daisy. Listen to
him, if you won't listen to me!

622
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,910
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.

623
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,110
You're back. You made good time.

624
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,510
We made the last train so
they're on their way south.

625
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,150
I wish I knew what it was about.

626
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,310
- Nothing to concern you, I promise.
- You missed a jolly good dinner.

627
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,150
I bought some sandwiches at the
station and ate them in the car.

628
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,350
You're a braver man than I am, Gunga Din.

629
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,870
We've been settling some
business while you were away.

630
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,470
- Oh? Yes? - Mama wants Mr
Mason to have Yew Tree Farm.

631
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,870
I see.

632
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,070
Of course, it's not a
business-like decision

633
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,830
and Cora has been using some
emotional blackmail on us.

634
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,310
I asked them what they felt
Sybil would want us to do.

635
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,110
Well, we all know the answer to that.

636
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,590
But is it enough to convince you?

637
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,710
I was reminded recently
of William's death.

638
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,350
And I suppose I do feel
old Mason's in our charge.

639
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,150
That's what I say.

640
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,270
- Shouldn't we wait for Mary?
- No. I'll handle Mary.

641
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,350
It'd be better if it's a fait accompli.

642
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,870
We don't have to do everything Mary
says. Not when we're all agreed.

643
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,720
Maybe it's underhand
to go behind her back.

644
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
But it's much too important to
me to let scruples get in the way.

645
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,910
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

646
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,720
- Your Ladyship.
- Daisy?

647
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,390
Yes, it's me. And I have to speak to you.

648
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,430
- Daisy...
- What are you doing here, Baxter?

649
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,430
I was a little worried about Daisy,
m'lady. She's been very upset.

650
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,590
- I have been upset.
- I'm sorry to hear it,

651
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,910
but I don't understand
what you're doing here.

652
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,230
Daisy, there you are. That was quick.

653
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,750
Will you tell Mr Mason
the news or should we?

654
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,790
Tell him what?

655
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,990
He's got the farm if he still wants it.

656
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,750
Isn't that why you're here?

657
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,560
What wonderful news. Daisy...

658
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,870
Wonderful.

659
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,000
She's going downstairs now, m'lady,
and I'll see you in your room.

660
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,110
That was rather peculiar.

661
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,360
I have a feeling I've just dodged
something and I don't know what.

662
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,960
Don't start.

663
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,310
- How is she?
- Resting.

664
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,350
Sleeping, I hope by now.

665
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,390
- Has she lost the baby?
- No.

666
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,430
We got there in time.

667
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,030
I've put in the stitch I spoke of
and as they say in medical novels,

668
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,440
I'm cautiously optimistic.

669
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,870
- And what shall I do now?
- Can you stay a day or two?

670
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,750
We could go back on Friday.

671
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,030
Good. Make her rest when she gets there

672
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,070
but don't fret too much.

673
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,710
I'm so grateful to you for
coming out here at dawn.

674
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,710
Don't worry. It'll be
reflected in my bill.

675
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,430
- Of course.
- And now I'll say goodbye.

676
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,630
I feel so... I don't know, dazed.

677
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,270
Yesterday I thought I hated her
and today she saved our lives.

678
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:00,070
It never does good to hate anyone.

679
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:04,310
So is this true? Your Mr Mason got
the farm after everything you said?

680
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,670
- Seems like it.
- I envy him.

681
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,190
Ooh, high praise from a city boy.

682
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,750
Not me. Country life is what I'm after.

683
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,600
I don't care where I started,
this is where I want to end up.

684
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,750
When will Carson get here tomorrow?

685
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,750
6:00, m'lord, if the train's on time.

686
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,430
Is anything planned as a welcome?

687
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,350
We're having a bit of a do in
the servants' hall to say hello.

688
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,470
Well, we'll come down.

689
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,990
And please tell Mrs Patmore
we can have a cold dinner

690
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,070
- if that would be easier.
- Very good, m'lord.

691
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,880
- Back to normal at last!
- I've enjoyed my time as butler.

692
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,270
I hope you've learned something from it.

693
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,470
You see, Barrow, Carson is a kind man.

694
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,920
Don't overlook that. It's
why people are loyal to him.

695
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,790
I'll bear it in mind, m'lord.

696
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,760
Do. It should be helpful when you
-- That is, when the hour strikes.

697
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,640
To move on. Yes, m'lord.

698
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,470
Welcome to the Royal Automobile Club.

699
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,110
Do you know it?

700
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,440
No, but I like to be surprised.

701
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,190
I'm sorry if I look rather shabby.

702
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,990
I didn't bring any clothes, so
I've stolen this from my aunt.

703
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
Hm.

704
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,430
You are the opposite of shabby.

705
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,830
I can't think why, but I've
never been here before.

706
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,870
When was it built?

707
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,910
1911.

708
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,550
The temple of car lovers.

709
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,510
Your love is not fickle, I'll admit.

710
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,150
But I'm afraid for me, a car
is simply to get from A to B.

711
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,190
Nothing more.

712
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,030
What is your enthusiasm? Horses?

713
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,230
No. I ride, I even hunt, but I
don't see horses in my dreams.

714
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,790
- What then?
- I like my work.

715
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,830
Do you work?

716
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,150
It's rather shocking, isn't it?

717
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,030
My father and I co-own the estate.

718
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,150
But I really function as the agent.

719
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,470
So many estates are going under these days

720
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,150
and I'm just determined that
Downton won't be one of them.

721
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,680
Far from shocked, I am
extremely impressed.

722
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,390
- And you have a son?
- Yes. George.

723
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,310
He'll take over eventually, I assume,

724
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,550
and when he does, I want to make sure

725
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,710
he's the master of a modern going concern.

726
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,550
He's also heir to his grandfather's title

727
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,670
for reasons too complicated
to bore you with.

728
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,320
So it's very neat and tidy.

729
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,350
Neat and tidy-ish.

730
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,940
But aren't you rather at a loose end?

731
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,110
I hope this means you're boiling
up to make a pass before we're done.

732
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,190
Probably.

733
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,230
But will you accept?

734
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,520
No. But I shall enjoy
the process enormously.

735
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,230
I can't believe it. I feel like I'm
standing at the gates of paradise.

736
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,150
I don't think it's any
nicer than your old farm.

737
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,430
But it's safe, Daisy. They'll not
sell this estate in my lifetime.

738
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,470
Lady Mary wouldn't allow it.

739
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,070
So I know now where I can lay my bones.

740
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,190
And it's down to you. You've
used your credit to rescue me.

741
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,390
I don't think I have got much credit.

742
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,870
Well, that's where you're wrong.

743
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,060
And here's the proof of it.

744
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,110
- They'll be here in a minute.
- Is that straight?

745
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,670
Down a bit on the left.

746
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,270
We're not striving for
a setting by Diaghilev.

747
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,720
The point is we've made an effort.

748
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,670
- Are you finished? - I've unpacked
and then they're changing tonight

749
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,710
so they can come down and say hello.

750
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,470
- And the trip went well?
- I think so, yes.

751
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Why?

752
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,790
Because I believe I
know what you're hiding.

753
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,040
And I feel sure I know what it is
that took you to London in a rush.

754
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,240
And I hope I'm wrong.

755
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,350
You're not wrong in all of it.

756
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,910
But you're wrong if you think
I'm hiding something sad.

757
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,560
What I've been hiding is very, very happy.

758
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Oh, God...

759
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
Are you sure?

760
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,550
- Really?
- Really.

761
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,600
They're here!

762
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
Aw!

763
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,030
Home again at last. I feel
I've been away for months.

764
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,590
Very flattering, I don't think!

765
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,440
Oh, thank you.

766
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,990
Oh, there you all are. Plotting!

767
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,470
You're the one who's plotting.

768
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,470
Is it really so important to keep
the Crawleys in command, Mama?

769
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,310
That is my sole motive, is it?

770
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,110
- Isn't it?
- No. No, it is not.

771
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,550
For years, I've watched governments
take control of our lives.

772
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,110
And their argument is always the same --

773
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,670
fewer costs, greater efficiency.

774
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,870
But the result is the same, too --

775
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,110
less control by the people,
more control by the state.

776
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,110
Until the individual's own
wishes count for nothing.

777
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,110
That is what I consider my duty to resist.

778
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,310
By wielding your unelected power?

779
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,950
You see, the point of a
so-called 'great family'

780
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,470
is to protect our freedoms.

781
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,430
That is why the barons made
King John sign the Magna Carta.

782
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,790
I do see that your argument was
more honourable than I'd appreciated.

783
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,510
But, Mama, we're not living in 1215.

784
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,350
And the strengths of great
families like ours is going,

785
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,230
- that's just fact.
- Your great-grandchildren won't thank you

786
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,190
when the state is all-powerful
because we didn't fight.

787
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,510
Well, I won't have any,
so I can live with that.

788
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,600
They've arrived, so we should go
down as soon as Mary gets here.

789
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,270
Have you told her about Mr Mason?

790
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,190
- I have.
- How'd she take it?

791
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,350
She's annoyed. But it
seems London went well

792
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,310
- so she's less cross than she might be.
- Good of you to come, Isobel.

793
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,510
We couldn't miss Carson's return.
And Mrs... Carson, of course.

794
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,910
I can't get my tongue round it.

795
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,950
We've simply got to learn.

796
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We ought to go down. I could hear
them shouting from my bedroom.

797
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,120
I haven't been into the
kitchens for at least 20 years.

798
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,660
Have you got your passport?

799
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,950
Make sure his Lordship has a drink, Andy.

800
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,030
- Hello, Molesley.
- Has it changed much since your day?

801
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,520
I only know I shall need Ariande's
thread to find my way out.

802
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,190
When are you going to
appoint your new editor?

803
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,350
Why can't it be you?

804
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,950
Well, I'd like to be a sort of co-editor,

805
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,590
but no man will put up with that so
I'm going to try and find a woman.

806
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,350
A woman editor? I applaud you.

807
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,390
Of course you do.

808
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,030
Presumably we may now look
forward to women field marshals

809
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,990
and a woman pope!

810
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,230
Nonsense, Granny. I
think it's a good idea.

811
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,270
It is a magazine for women.

812
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,080
Well, we should congratulate them.

813
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,790
That was nice of you,
to praise Edith's plan.

814
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,640
A monkey will type out the Bible
if you leave it long enough.

815
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,430
Carson, Mrs Carson.

816
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,590
I'm so sorry I missed the wedding but
I'm delighted to be here tonight.

817
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,070
Thank you.

818
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,710
"Mrs Carson..."

819
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,310
It's like Jane Eyre asking
to be called Mrs Rochester.

820
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,360
- I'll never get used to it.
- None of us will.

821
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,110
When will the trial be?

822
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,030
I don't know yet. No doubt I'll
find out when the time comes.

823
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,070
At least he can't hurt you now.

824
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,110
Can't he?

825
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,710
Mama's slipped away. She was
tired, so I told her to go.

826
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,110
- Quite right. - I'm afraid she
won't give up. About the hospital.

827
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,390
I shan't think that at her funeral.

828
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,430
Who says she won't be at yours?

829
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,040
Oh, thank you.

830
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,190
- Thank you.
- Anything to report, Mr Barrow?

831
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,950
Only that being a butler is more
complicated than I'd realised.

832
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,790
If you've learnt that,
you've used your time well.

833
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,550
Your cottage is ready and your
things have been taken there.

834
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,750
That's very considerate,
m'lady. Thank you.

835
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,470
You must let us know if anything
needs to be done, Mrs... Mrs Carson.

836
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,190
Well, now, m'lord, this is the thing.

837
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,990
Won't it be confusing if we're to
be called Carson and Mrs Carson?

838
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,710
Rather as we resisted
Anna being Mrs Bates,

839
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,390
would it be very irregular

840
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,430
if we continued to be
Carson and Mrs Hughes?

841
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,550
Oh, hallelujah! You've
made me a happy man.

842
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,830
Let us raise a glass and drink
the health of the newly-weds.

843
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,710
Still to be known in this house at
any rate as Carson and Mrs Hughes.

844
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,270
Carson and Mrs Hughes.

845
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,310
Good heavens, there really is a God.

846
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,560
- What a relief.
- To no-one more than his Lordship.

847
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,230
I just want to go and check my room.
Make sure they've taken everything.

848
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,280
Right you are.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

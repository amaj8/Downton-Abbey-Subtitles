1
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,320
Daisy, put that into the oven.

2
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,130
Ohh!

3
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,650
Have you chosen what you want yet?

4
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,370
Whatever you think best.

5
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,130
That doesn't sound like a bride
on the brink of wedded bliss!

6
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,370
It's a long time since I've
been on the brink of anything.

7
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,410
Except possibly the grave.

8
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,450
I wanted a big wedding breakfast.

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,370
All of us sat at groaning
tables having a jolly time.

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,490
- Why can't you have that?
- It's not how posh people do it.

11
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
They stand about with nibbly bits stuck in
their teeth and that's what we've to do.

12
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,450
I don't see why. We could put
trestle tables up in the hall.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,290
No, Mr Carson wants it like
the family would do it.

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,610
(SIGHS) I don't mind.

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,650
Not really.

16
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,410
- So what are you going to wear?
- My brown day dress.

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,450
Anna is going to tidy it up a bit.

18
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,810
It's simple, but I'm sure it will be fine.

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,610
Because I've got a new
catalogue. It's so easy.

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,060
You send a postal order and
they send you the dress!

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,730
I know what a catalogue is, thank you.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,900
I'm too old to think a new
dress will solve anything much.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,700
Well, you're not wasting
money, that's for sure.

24
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,770
Mama! What are you doing here?

25
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,810
I wasn't expecting you.

26
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,170
I want to be quite certain you're thinking sensibly
about the possible changes at the hospital.

27
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,530
By thinking sensibly, you
mean thinking like you.

28
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,570
Of course.

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,610
Cora believes you're wrong.

30
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,650
Cora is confused.

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,370
And when she sees sense,
she'll agree with you?

32
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,410
You have been talking to Isobel.

33
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,730
Since they made her the almoner,
she's never been the same.

34
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,970
- I have been talking to Cora.
- That is a mistake.

35
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,810
You can't expect me to avoid
talking to my own wife!

36
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,540
Why not? I know several couples who are
perfectly happy, haven't spoken in years.

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,890
Hello, Granny! They
didn't say you were here.

38
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm here to make sure of your
father in the coming fight.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,180
I'm off to London to calm my editor.

40
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,730
Say goodbye to Mama.

41
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,570
Will you stay with Rosamund?

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,690
I don't know how long I'll be
there. So I'll stay at the flat.

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,530
Is it proper for a young
woman to be alone in a flat?

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,970
Granny, Adrienne Bolland flew alone
over the Andes mountains four years ago.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,010
Anyway, I'm not a young woman.

46
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,050
I'm staring middle age in the face.

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,090
- Granny!
- Have you seen your mama?

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,050
She's just finishing off
the menus with Mrs Patmore.

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,090
Then I will be off.

50
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,130
Why not stay and say hello?

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,130
Oh... I have a feeling Cora and I will be
saying hello rather less than... en garde!

52
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,250
.. in the next few weeks.

53
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,010
Right.

54
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,050
What if we keep the Dover sole

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,090
and change the cod to a crown roast?

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,050
- I'll do peaches in brandy.
- That sounds more like it.

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,090
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

58
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,010
- Is everything else all right?
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,730
That is... I'm a bit
concerned about the wedding.

60
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,370
Why is that? Don't hesitate to
charge it all to the house account.

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,810
Oh, very kind, I'm sure.
But it's not that.

62
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,370
- Mrs Hughes isn't happy.
- I'm sorry to hear it.

63
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,130
- Is she regretting her decision?
- It's not her decision she regrets

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,250
so much as his decision.

65
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,930
What is that?

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,650
A stamp to mark the
British Empire exhibition.

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,770
Just been released. First
commemorative stamp ever.

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,810
What's that great lion doing?

69
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,850
It's the lion of Britain
with the head of the king.

70
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,260
Hm! I think it's silly.

71
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,410
Because you understand nothing.

72
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,450
(BELL)

73
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
I'll go.

74
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,180
(VOICES)

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,570
- Ahem.
- Who was that?

76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,500
- Who was... what?
- Whoever was outside.

77
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,130
- Was nobody.
- Very talkative for a nobody.

78
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,420
I meant... He'd come to the wrong house.

79
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,460
Haven't we all?

80
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,490
- Did Lady Edith get off OK?
- As far as I know.

81
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,650
I can't think why she doesn't sack the
wretched man and find someone else.

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,090
Unless she enjoys racing up to London
in a swirling cloud of crisis and drama.

83
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,250
I've had rather a sad
letter from Mr Branson.

84
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,290
Listen.

85
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,330
I dreamt last night I was
in the park at Downton,

86
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,690
walking with Sybbie under the great trees,

87
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,650
listening to the pigeons
cooing in their branches.

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,130
And when I woke, my eyes
were filled with tears.

89
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,650
- That's very moving.
- I agree.

90
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,690
I owe him a letter.

91
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,210
I'll write after Carson's wedding.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,220
Talking of which, I feel
sorry for Mrs Hughes.

93
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,530
I said I'd brighten up her frock for her.

94
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,290
When she gave it me, it was an old day
dress. There wasn't much I could do.

95
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,330
Can't I lend her a brooch or something?

96
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,650
I told Mrs Patmore and she said not
to worry. Maybe she's got a plan.

97
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,690
Let's hope so.

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
Have you given any more
thought to Mr Ryder's advice?

99
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
I have.

100
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,250
You're not...

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,380
- Too early to tell.
- Lord knows the problem isn't Bates!

102
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,570
Honestly, My Lady! If I repeated some
of the things you say downstairs...

103
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,130
Should you be working? I can
manage. And there's always Baxter.

104
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,170
No, Mr Bates would smell a rat.

105
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,810
I don't want him to know anything until
it's worked and I'm almost showing.

106
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,650
He'd put so much on to it.

107
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,170
At the end of the third month, I'll invent
an appointment and we'll whizz up to London!

108
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,530
- How exciting!
- I don't want to be excited.

109
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,250
Not until I know it's going to happen.

110
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,730
Looking for a place, Mr Barrow?

111
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,770
I might be. Would you be sorry?

112
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,810
They've not said anything though.

113
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,850
Mr Carson is hoping I'll resign.

114
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,770
To avoid any possible
unpleasantness, that's all.

115
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,810
What do you think of this?

116
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,570
Experienced manservant required

117
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,930
for a position of trust
in a prominent household.

118
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,770
Sounds interesting. Where is it?

119
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,730
I'm only looking in the Yorkshire
papers. I want to stay up here.

120
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,850
Careful, Mr Barrow. Someone might accuse
you of having feelings for the area.

121
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,890
Would that be so hard to believe?

122
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,810
Harder for you to accept
than for us to believe.

123
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,690
Am I here tonight without cousin Violet

124
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,730
to cement my alliance with Cora?

125
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,770
No, not at all!

126
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,330
Carson, could you ask Mrs Hughes
to join us in the drawing room?

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,370
Mrs Hughes, My Lady?

128
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,810
I want to ask her something and
I'd like Lady Mary to be there.

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,460
- What are you getting at?
- Carson?

130
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,730
Of course, Your Ladyship.

131
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,650
Shall we go through? Are
you staying tonight, Robert?

132
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,690
No, I don't want to miss anything.

133
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,410
Does cousin Violet know
I'm here this evening?

134
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,250
Not unless you've told her.

135
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,970
I don't want her to think
I'm plotting against her.

136
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,020
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

137
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,170
But I don't want her to know.

138
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,810
Her Ladyship is going to help Mr Mason.

139
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,130
When I was in the drawing room,
she almost said it out loud!

140
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,770
Let's hope so.

141
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,530
Now, will you let me take
you through the exam papers?

142
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,450
- Are you losing confidence in me?
- No, it's not that.

143
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,490
I'm sure you know the answers.

144
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,530
But sometimes it can be hard
to make out the question.

145
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,770
Mr Molesley, shall we ask them
to come down and help themselves?

146
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,090
- Sorry, Mr Carson.
- Is Mrs Hughes in her room?

147
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,140
As far as I know.

148
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,930
- How may I help, My Lady?
- I'm sorry to put you on the spot.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,650
But I believe you've been rather
railroaded over your reception.

150
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,570
I understand you don't want
to be married from this house.

151
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,610
- What?
- Why ever not?

152
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,930
My Lady, we're both honoured
to be allowed the privilege --

153
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,330
No. I want to hear from Mrs Hughes.

154
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,250
Your Ladyship, I have no
wish to sound ungrateful.

155
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,290
This is a fine house.

156
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,330
And Mr Carson's right.

157
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,850
It would be an honour
to hold our party here.

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,890
But it's not what you want.

159
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,250
Well, to start with, I'd like a kind of reception
that's different from the ones you're used to.

160
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,690
With a solid meal served at proper tables.

161
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,930
Does anyone have a sit-down
wedding breakfast any more?

162
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,970
A great many people, My Lady.

163
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,850
And then I'd like to feel
we could ask all sorts.

164
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,730
Everyone who's been
part of our lives here.

165
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,010
And I'd planned for music later on.

166
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,050
And maybe a bit of a hoolie.

167
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,890
None of which would be
suitable in the Great Hall.

168
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,450
- It would not.
- There you are, we're agreeing.

169
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,010
Mrs Hughes, doesn't Carson
deserve a wedding in this house?

170
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,410
Where he has served this family
for so long and with such loyalty.

171
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,770
And will continue to do so while
there is breath in his body.

172
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,410
Well, then.

173
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,450
But this is our day, My Lady.

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,440
It's about Charles
Carson and Elsie Hughes.

175
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,970
And not about this glorious house or the
glorious people who have lived in it.

176
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,930
Just us, and that's the way
I'd like to celebrate it.

177
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,290
I couldn't understand more, Mrs Hughes.

178
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,330
I hope we'll be invited.

179
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,370
Of course you will all be invited.

180
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,410
We'd be honoured if you come.

181
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,730
But it would be our day,
celebrated in our way.

182
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,450
Do you know where you
will stage this festivity?

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,010
I had thought about the
schoolhouse, My Lord.

184
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,050
But Mr Carson doesn't care for it.

185
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,090
I don't mind the schoolhouse.

186
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,610
Right, then it would seem to be settled.

187
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,650
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

188
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Thank you, My Lady.

189
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,170
- Why did we have to listen to that?!
- I want you to stop bullying them.

190
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,610
- And let them do it their way.
- You think I'm a bully?

191
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,250
- I think you're a snob.
- How do you make that out?

192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,370
She didn't want the bother of a
servants' wedding in the hall.

193
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,410
That's not fair. We...

194
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Ahem.

195
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Going out, Mr Spratt?

196
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,170
Do I have your permission?

197
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,010
You can go round the world
as far as I'm concerned.

198
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,660
That's very considerate of you.
But a breath of air is all I need.

199
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
(KNOCKING)

200
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,570
Denker, I wonder if I might have
something warm to drink before I go up.

201
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,610
Yes, certainly, My Lady.

202
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,770
How about a nice cup of hot chocolate?

203
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,160
Oh, just the thing. Thank you.

204
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,170
- Um...
- Yes?

205
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,050
My Lady, Mr Spratt seems very
preoccupied at the moment.

206
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,370
I wondered if you knew what it was about.

207
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,530
Does this spring from a
concern for his welfare?

208
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,970
We all have to rub along
together, don't we?

209
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,250
Well, it would be nice if we could.

210
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,930
I worry. Perhaps one of
his friends is in trouble.

211
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,010
I know nothing of Spratt's friends.

212
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,050
I know he has a great many relations

213
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,290
who seem to get married and
buried with numbing regularity.

214
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,330
Usually on very inconvenient days.

215
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,370
Perhaps it's one of them?

216
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
Why don't you ask him?

217
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,450
While you're making my chocolate.

218
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,140
Yes, My Lady. Of course.

219
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,930
Oh, My Lord. A quick word.

220
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,170
It may be that we have a painless
solution to the problem of Barrow.

221
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,610
Oh, yes?

222
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,930
He's applying for a job in the vicinity.

223
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,130
Do you know of a house
called Dryden Park, near York?

224
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,970
The name rings a bell. I think
my parents used to go there.

225
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,490
But I haven't heard anything about it
for years. Is that where he's off to?

226
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,050
- Hopefully. We shall see.
- Ahem.

227
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,570
- Are you quite well?
- Oh, yes.

228
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,680
Just a bit of indigestion.

229
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,050
Carson.

230
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,770
I hope you weren't upset by that
business in the drawing room.

231
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,130
Not at all, My Lady. As a matter
of fact, I don't believe Her Ladyship
was acting for snobbish reasons.

232
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,530
Perhaps not. But it annoys me to see
you cheated of your just desserts.

233
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,850
- I wanted the best for you.
- And I shall have it, My Lady.

234
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,020
If you attend the wedding,
that's enough for me.

235
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Good night.

236
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,060
(BELL)

237
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,170
- Yes?
- Hello.

238
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,410
I telephoned earlier in
response to the advertisement.

239
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,450
- Name's Barrow.
- Come in.

240
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,570
- Come in.
- Thank you.

241
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,250
Lady Edith Crawley?

242
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,450
- It is you, isn't it?
- Hello...

243
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,890
Bertie Pelham. We met at Brancaster
when it was let to Lord Sinderby.

244
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,970
Of course! I'm sorry to be so
dense. I remember you very well.

245
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,010
You're the agent. Or you were then.

246
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,530
I am now. Business has brought
me to London for a few days.

247
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,170
Me too.

248
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,530
In fact, it's the longest time I've
spent in London since my cousin came out.

249
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,970
She was with us at
Brancaster. Rose Aldridge.

250
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,810
I remember. I thought you
were a very jolly party.

251
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,850
I told Lord Hexham he should try and
let to the Sinderbys again this year!

252
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,890
Are you having a good time in London?

253
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,250
Well, I've been working since I arrived.

254
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,770
- And missing Marigold, of course.
- Marigold?

255
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,490
My... That is, my ward.

256
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,530
- Our ward.
- Of course.

257
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,570
You told me about her.

258
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,890
- I'd better get on.
- I expect you're busy.

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,290
I'm not usually, but I've got rather
a drama on my hands with my magazine.

260
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,410
You've probably forgotten,
but I own a magazine.

261
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,530
Indeed I have not. I thought
it was incredibly modern.

262
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,090
It's incredibly complicated at the moment.

263
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,610
Which is why I have to
get back to the office.

264
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,450
I don't suppose you'd like
a drink with me later on.

265
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,690
- Well...
- Only I'm going home tomorrow.

266
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,730
And I'm not sure when I'll be back.

267
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,410
All right. Why not?

268
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,570
But it will have to be near the office.

269
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,610
We're in Covent Garden.

270
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,370
What about Rules? Will they
let us have a drink there?

271
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,530
I should think so. Shall we say seven?

272
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,980
I'm going to hurry away
before you change your mind!

273
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,610
Perhaps you could tell me a
little more about the job, Mr...

274
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,130
Reresby. Sir Michael Reresby.

275
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,170
Oh.

276
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,010
As you can see, we've
rather let things slide.

277
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,000
It's been very difficult
since my wife died.

278
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,620
I can imagine, Sir Michael.

279
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,880
She was a lady in waiting, do you know?

280
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,200
- To the old Duchess of Connaught. - Ah.

281
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,690
Do you have any other family?

282
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Two sons.

283
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,900
But they... They never
came back from the war.

284
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,010
Very sorry to hear that.

285
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,290
- Did you serve?
- I was in Flanders, yes.

286
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,060
I served. I got this there.

287
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,180
That's what I need. Someone who knows about
fighting for his king and his country.

288
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,930
I expect this was a wonderful
house for entertaining.

289
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,970
Oh, you should have seen it!

290
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,010
We had such fun in those days.

291
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
(SIGHS)

292
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,100
Do you know what I shall always remember?

293
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,460
The women going up to bed
at the end of the evening.

294
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,140
Their faces lit by the
flame from the candle.

295
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,210
Yes, diamonds twinkling

296
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,900
as they climbed up into the darkness.

297
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,410
Shall we go through here?

298
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,890
As you can see, it's all rather silted up.

299
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,610
- Can you clear a space?
- Of course.

300
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,610
So can you let me know more about the job?

301
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,860
How many staff do you have?

302
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,330
Well, there's Mrs Tonkins. She
comes in three days a week.

303
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,090
And she has to manage everything?

304
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,080
We do have a man outside
every now and then.

305
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,410
But that's why we need you.

306
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,180
In your advertisement, you spoke of a position
of trust, Sir Michael, in a prominent household.

307
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,850
This is a very prominent household.

308
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,890
Can you doubt it?

309
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,930
We have entertained not
just the Connaughts,

310
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,570
but the Fife princesses!

311
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,490
Both of them. The Duke of
Argyll. The Queen of Spain.

312
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,530
Yes... But that was some time ago.

313
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,570
Are you a republican?

314
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,730
No. I don't believe so, but then I've
never really thought about it much.

315
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,770
Well, think about it now!

316
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,530
I can't risk a republican in this
household when anyone might call!

317
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,170
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I'm not quite up to it.

318
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,210
Philosophically.

319
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,890
Thank heavens we picked that
up before he caused any trouble!

320
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
I should be going.

321
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,610
I hope you find the man
you're looking for.

322
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,170
We can't let them down, do you see?

323
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,260
When the good times return,
they will all come back.

324
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,450
We must be ready.

325
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,850
Can't let our standards slip.

326
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,890
No.

327
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,480
And good luck with those standards.

328
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,410
This is what you had
in mind for the cover?

329
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,050
No, don't touch that!

330
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,890
It does seem similar to
last month's, Mr Skinner.

331
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,930
Don't be so absurd. Please!

332
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,970
Where is the copy for this?

333
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:26,330
Mr Skinner, this really isn't finished.

334
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,370
I have dealt with amateurism.

335
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,410
I've even dealt with incompetence.

336
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,730
But this ridiculous, muddle-headed
meddling just about --

337
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,770
Mr Skinner! That's quite enough.

338
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,500
If that's how you feel, I suggest
we part company once and for all.

339
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,730
I've done it. He's gone.

340
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,770
Good riddance.

341
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,810
And well done.

342
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,850
But what happens now?

343
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,890
We have to get it out by tomorrow.

344
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,610
We have to get the proofs
to the printers by 4am.

345
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,970
- You can't mean to do it yourself.
- Why not?

346
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,650
I refuse to be defeated by a
petulant and overweight tyrant.

347
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,690
I'll lay out the articles as usual.

348
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,730
It's seven o'clock.

349
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,770
Which means we have nine hours.

350
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,890
We'd better get some coffee on and...

351
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,930
Oh, crikey!

352
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,970
I won't be long.

353
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,360
Keep getting the copy together.

354
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,560
- May I help you, madam?
- I won't be long.

355
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,490
I'm so, so sorry. Believe me, if you knew
what I'm living through, you'd forgive me.

356
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,970
- I forgive you anyway.
- I can't have a drink.

357
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,010
I'd love to, but I can't.

358
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,050
My editor has walked out.

359
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,610
I have to get the magazine to the
printers by four in the morning.

360
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,530
So it's sandwiches and
coffee and work until dawn.

361
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,850
- All right.
- You're a darling. Thank you.

362
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,890
Do telephone me if and when
you're up in London again.

363
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,250
No, I meant all right, I'll come with you.

364
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,890
- Come with me where?
- Back to the office.

365
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,330
I can make coffee. I can fetch sandwiches.

366
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,420
I can... carry bits of paper around.

367
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,330
- Shouldn't we get going?
- Aren't you having dinner somewhere?

368
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,770
I thought that's why
you hadn't suggested it.

369
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,730
No, I didn't think you'd accept dinner. I
planned to ask you halfway through the drink.

370
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,180
Right, well, we should get back.

371
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,610
So it's just the causes of the war.

372
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,650
Both wars.

373
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,170
The Spanish succession and the Austrian
succession. You're comparing them.

374
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,610
Don't forget. Keep it
simple and straightforward.

375
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,660
What is it?

376
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,930
Oh...

377
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,970
I don't know if I should tell you.

378
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,530
Tell me if it's important.
Don't if it's not.

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
It might be.

380
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,330
When I was serving tea in the library,

381
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,130
I heard them say that the Drewes
are giving up Yew Tree Farm.

382
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,170
That's what she was thinking!

383
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,810
Her Ladyship knew they were
going to hand in the lease.

384
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,050
She couldn't decide
whether to say anything!

385
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,090
- Don't jump the gun.
- I knew she'd had an idea. I said it!

386
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,610
You've made me so happy! This is
just the tonic Mr Mason needs.

387
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,050
- But it's not definite yet.
- I'll say that. I'll tell him that.

388
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
But he'll be made up.

389
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,290
(BELL)

390
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,330
Who's that?

391
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,370
Somebody at the back door.

392
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,930
Never mind. Mrs Porter can answer
it. It's probably a delivery.

393
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,980
At this time?

394
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,050
Mr Willis, what brings you here?

395
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,090
I'm sorry to call so late.

396
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,080
But I've had an enquiry
which concerns you.

397
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,010
Mm, I'm all ears!

398
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,800
Mr Spratt, do you know a Mr Wally Stern?

399
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,810
Yes, he's my sister's son.

400
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,050
He's been serving time in York prison.

401
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,690
Oh.

402
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,010
Is it absolutely necessary
for Miss Denker to be present?

403
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,170
- Killjoy.
- She'll be questioned next.

404
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,410
So what's the point in
asking her to leave?

405
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,050
Thank you, Sergeant.

406
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,490
I'm aware of the present situation
of my unfortunate nephew.

407
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,810
Not the present situation, I'm afraid.

408
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,250
Mr Stern recently absconded from prison.

409
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,290
He's currently on the run.

410
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,010
Someone answering his description
has been seen in this neighbourhood.

411
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,730
Naturally, we wondered if
he'd tried to make contact.

412
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,770
Not with me, Sergeant, no.

413
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,290
Miss Denker, can you add anything?

414
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,650
No.

415
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,810
Nothing that leads you to suppose
a man was hanging around the house?

416
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,850
I'm afraid not, Sergeant.

417
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,370
Perhaps the identification was a mistake.

418
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,410
Is he very distinctive to look at?

419
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,820
Um... Not very. Quite ordinary, in fact.

420
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,050
All right.

421
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,090
Well, that would seem to be that.

422
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,130
I'll say goodbye.

423
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,450
Of course, if he tries to get in touch...

424
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,840
We'll be on to you in a moment.

425
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,290
I'm sorry. I don't know why
he wanted to drag you into it.

426
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,450
What an interesting family
you have, Mr Spratt.

427
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,810
Mine are quite dull by comparison.

428
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,130
I haven't seen him for years.

429
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,010
It's your sister I feel sorry for.

430
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,060
- She has done nothing to deserve it.
- Of course not.

431
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,370
I do have one question though.

432
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,410
What's that?

433
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,730
After you put him up in the potting shed,

434
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,780
did he get away safely?

435
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,550
- What's the idea?
- Lady Eltham's costume ball.

436
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,510
I can't decide which guests
are the most important.

437
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,470
Never mind that. Best
clothes and prettiest faces.

438
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,990
Nobody cares about anything else.

439
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,710
You have the address.
They're waiting for you.

440
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,750
He's got everything he needs.

441
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,110
- Put it into Mr Brent's hands.
- Yes, ma'am.

442
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
- I'll get you some more coffee.
- Would you?

443
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,630
- Well, you did it.
- We did it.

444
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,960
I really am so grateful.

445
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,910
Are you an editor now?

446
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,550
Does this count in your profession
as a sort of baptism of blood?

447
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,590
I don't know what will happen next.

448
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,190
But it's nice to know I
can do it if I have to.

449
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,230
You certainly can.

450
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,390
I won't though. Not yet.

451
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,150
I'll put someone in charge as a caretaker.

452
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Then I'll think.

453
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,110
In the end, the question must be
are you a country woman or a townie?

454
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,150
It's more than that.

455
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,510
I know now I need a purpose.

456
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,590
That's what I've learned.

457
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,470
I can't just lead one of
those purposeless lives.

458
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,510
You inspire me.

459
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,550
Not many people would say that.

460
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,800
They would if they knew you.

461
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Thank you, Audrey.

462
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,270
So you go home today.

463
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,910
Yes. I'll catch the twelve o'clock
and try and sleep on the train!

464
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,950
What about you?

465
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,500
I'll settle in the new
editor and go back after that.

466
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,350
Our butler is getting married on Saturday.

467
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,670
- Which is quite a big thing.
- Has he been with you a long time?

468
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,470
Forever. He joined us as a junior
footman in my grandfather's day.

469
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,510
I love those stories.

470
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,230
I wonder how much longer
people will tell them.

471
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,270
I know.

472
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,520
Let's not be sad, not today.

473
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,140
After all, we've just edited a magazine.

474
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,630
This just came for you.

475
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,870
- Oh, thank you very much.
- What is it?

476
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,920
Never you mind.

477
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,110
Oh, what a relief! I thought
it wasn't going to get here.

478
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,670
May we know what it is?

479
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,390
It's a frock I ordered as
a surprise for Mrs Hughes.

480
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,230
But with the wedding tomorrow,
I thought we'd missed it.

481
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,350
- Can we have a look?
- Don't see why not.

482
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,510
- Just check Mr Carson's gone.
- It's a relief to me as well.

483
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,630
The one she wanted to wear was awful.

484
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,670
Oh.

485
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,710
Well, it's very...

486
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,350
It's an improvement, we can say that.

487
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,390
Is it? What was the last one like?!

488
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,230
I don't understand. It was
so nice in the picture.

489
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,590
It wasn't dear but... It
seemed like a bargain.

490
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,630
It's the thought that counts.

491
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,670
Not with a frock, it's not!

492
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,310
Lady Mary says she'll lend
her a brooch or something.

493
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,950
A brooch? She'll need a diamond
parure to make this look any good.

494
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
She's coming!

495
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,480
Daisy, I'm afraid Gertie's ill,
so can I ask you to do the fires?

496
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,830
I'm sorry to get you up so early.

497
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,870
That's all right, My Lady.

498
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,310
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast?

499
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,160
No. I've had a cup of tea. That's enough.

500
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
I'm having luncheon in York
after I see the hospital.

501
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,070
Daisy, you don't do the bedroom
fires these days, do you?

502
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,110
Not as a rule, My Lady, no.

503
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,070
But Gertie's unwell. And we don't
have a proper scullery maid any more.

504
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,190
I'm afraid I'm not usually
up early enough to know that.

505
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,430
I just wanted to say how
very grateful I am, My Lady.

506
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,990
- Grateful? For what?
- When you said you had a plan.

507
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,310
It was because the Drewes might be
leaving Yew Tree Farm, wasn't it?

508
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,550
- Well...
- I know you can't say anything.

509
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,710
But I'm so thankful to you for trying.

510
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,230
Is something the matter, My Lady?

511
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,670
- I hope she wasn't bothering you.
- No, but...

512
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,710
Never mind.

513
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
We'll see what happens.

514
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,870
Do you remember I thought Mrs Patmore might
have an idea about Mrs Hughes's dress?

515
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,150
She did, and it arrived this morning.

516
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,190
- No good?
- No good at all.

517
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,750
Horrible, in fact. And it's too
late now to order anything else.

518
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,790
Can't we lend her a dress?

519
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,030
She wouldn't fit into a dress of yours.

520
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,390
- And Her Ladyship is too tall.
- An embroidered evening coat?

521
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,430
The length wouldn't matter so much.

522
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,270
I'll ask Mama when I get up.

523
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,110
Miss Baxter said she was
leaving early to go into York.

524
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,150
That's right. She's out all day.

525
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,470
She goes straight from York
to a meeting with Dr Clarkson.

526
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,320
We'll have to manage without her.
She won't mind. She'll be pleased.

527
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,670
I um...

528
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,680
.. just want to make sure
everything is under control.

529
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,550
I think so. Mr Brock is bringing the
flowers and foliage in the morning.

530
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,200
And Mrs Patmore is on top of things.

531
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,790
Are you nervous?

532
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,270
A little. And I'm sad about my dress.

533
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,950
I wish I'd made more of an effort.

534
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,990
But it's too late now.

535
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,030
I'm sure you'll look wonderful.

536
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,470
- Well, I'll look tidy.
- What about tonight?

537
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,310
We mustn't see each other tonight.

538
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,350
I'm having dinner in here.

539
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,280
And they'll warn you when I'm going
up so we don't meet on the stairs!

540
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,870
Am I hearing right?

541
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,990
You went behind our backs and
betrayed us to the enemy?

542
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,150
Whose enemy? They're not my enemy.

543
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,750
I asked to see the Royal Yorkshire.

544
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,910
And to meet with the doctors in charge

545
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,270
so I could learn the benefits of a merger.

546
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,030
Today, they were good enough to
give me a tour and a luncheon.

547
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,030
- Am I to think ill of them for that?
- And you don't call that betrayal?

548
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,150
It's called being in
possession of the facts.

549
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,190
I wondered when we'd hear from you.

550
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,430
It's unfortunate if you've given them the
impression that we approve of the plan.

551
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,470
But I do approve of it.

552
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,030
And you're the fount
of wisdom on this topic!

553
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,190
I don't claim to know
more than any of you.

554
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,630
I'm glad you don't claim to know
more than I do, Lady Grantham.

555
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,870
- But I am disappointed.
- And we know why.

556
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,910
If we don't, I gather we will soon.

557
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,950
I'm afraid you see the new arrangement
as diminishing your own importance.

558
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,070
- What?
- You're the king of this place.

559
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,390
But once it's a wing of the Royal
Yorkshire, you'll be one more local doctor.

560
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,440
With some authority, yes.
But it will not be the same.

561
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,430
- Mrs Crawley doesn't mean that.
- I'd like to think that.

562
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,590
But it sounds very much as if she does.

563
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,630
Did you drink at luncheon?

564
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,150
No, I did not. Which you know
very well since we were together.

565
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,190
Not all the time.

566
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,310
Shall we call a halt to this
before we say things we will regret?

567
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,670
I rather hope Mrs Crawley
regrets what she's said already.

568
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,710
I'm going home.

569
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,350
In future, let's try to manage
things in a more civilised manner.

570
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,390
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson.

571
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,440
Goodbye, Lady Grantham.

572
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,670
Has tea gone up?

573
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,710
Not yet, oh great one.

574
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,830
How did you get on at Dryden Park?

575
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,270
It wasn't right for me, Mr Carson.

576
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,040
Pity. Mr Molesley, Andrew, tea.

577
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,670
- Won't be long now.
- Something will turn up.

578
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,230
I expect you will be glad
to see the back of me.

579
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
If it's what you want.

580
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,430
- He means it too.
- Don't fish.

581
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,950
Especially where they're
never going to bite.

582
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,110
- You've got me wrong.
You all have. - How?

583
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,870
I don't want anything
from Andy but friendship.

584
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,030
We were friends when he first came. I
helped to get him the job, for God's sake!

585
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,590
But now you've all poisoned
his mind against me.

586
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,630
- Then tell him.
- It's too late.

587
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,750
The damage has been done.

588
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,280
You don't believe me anyway.

589
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,110
Mrs Hughes.

590
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,950
Can you pop up to Her
Ladyship's room for a moment?

591
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,990
- Whatever for?
- Lady Mary has a surprise for you.

592
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,550
A surprise? For me?

593
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,590
Why?

594
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,750
You're getting married tomorrow. That
might have something to do with it.

595
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,940
Can we meet there at five?

596
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,390
Here she is, the famous editor!

597
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,780
Trailing streamers of success.

598
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,510
This is the mock-up.

599
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,070
It does seem weird that
we managed it in time.

600
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,110
We managed it?

601
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,150
The office. We all pulled together.

602
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,280
I think it's perfectly
brilliant, darling. Don't you?

603
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,990
I'm back, but I'm going
upstairs to get straight.

604
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,430
- And to calm down.
- Why? How was your day?

605
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,040
The morning was interesting.
The afternoon was ghastly.

606
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,670
Oh, Mama, you'll find...

607
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,870
See? That dress doesn't look bad now

608
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,070
as a foil to set off the
colours of the embroidery.

609
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,110
I agree. It's plainness is a virtue.

610
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,460
And I'm sure we can do
something about the length.

611
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,310
Excuse me? Will someone
explain to me what's going on?

612
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,030
- Didn't Lady Mary tell you, My Lady?
- Tell me what?

613
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,390
That Mrs Hughes is going to borrow
one of your coats to be married in.

614
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,310
Was I to have any say in this as
you rifle through my cupboards?

615
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,150
Your Ladyship, there's obviously
been a misunderstanding.

616
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,190
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes.

617
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:50,310
This is not the kind of behaviour
I would look for from you.

618
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,350
We'll hang them up at once
and leave you in peace.

619
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,390
Lady Mary said --

620
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,110
Lady Mary may dispose of her
own clothes as she sees fit.

621
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,070
But I do not know what gives her
the right to dispose of mine.

622
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,400
Now please leave me. I have a
headache and I need to lie down.

623
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,790
- You're very prompt.
- Oh, My Lady.

624
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,830
We've had an awful business.

625
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,990
Her Ladyship walked in when Mrs
Hughes was trying on the coats.

626
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,470
I don't know. She seemed to
think we were stealing them.

627
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,510
- Don't be silly.
- I'm not.

628
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,070
I've never seen her so angry.
Poor Mrs Hughes. She feels awful.

629
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,640
We can't have that on the day
before her wedding. Leave it to me.

630
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

631
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,470
I hope Anna's wrong, but she seems to
think you wouldn't lend Mrs Hughes a coat.

632
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,430
I just walked in and they
were putting on my clothes.

633
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,470
Please tell me you weren't rude.

634
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,550
Your mother has had a horrible afternoon with
Granny. They were at each other's throats.

635
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,190
Does that excuse insulting a woman who
has served us faithfully for many years,

636
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,550
who simply wanted something
nice to be married in?

637
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,600
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I tried to but you stormed off.

638
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,870
What was Mrs Hughes doing in there?

639
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,910
Typical though, isn't it?

640
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,350
30 years of service, one wrong move,
and... snap, you're out on your ear.

641
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,870
They're very appreciative of our service.

642
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,710
It was not a wrong move and
she is not out on her ear.

643
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,750
I won't speak ill of Her Ladyship.

644
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,110
Not when she's doing what
she's doing for Mr Mason.

645
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,150
- What's this?
- Daisy.

646
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,790
- You must talk when it isn't settled.
- I want to get things settled.

647
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,830
Don't we all?

648
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,590
You seem unusually disenchanted
with life these days, Mr Barrow.

649
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,110
I can't see the future, Mr Carson.

650
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,760
But then, I suppose, none of us can.

651
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,590
Don't let it upset you.

652
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
It does upset me.

653
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,480
I felt like a naughty
child in need of a smack.

654
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,630
Anyway, I'm going up now. It's past ten.

655
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,240
- (KNOCKING)
- Yes?

656
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,840
- May I come in?
- Please.

657
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,830
Mrs Hughes, I won't beat about the bush.

658
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,870
I behaved badly earlier.

659
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
I hope you'll accept my apology.

660
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,790
It must have been strange to
find us all there, My Lady.

661
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,630
Nevertheless, I have no
excuse to behave as I did.

662
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,470
Not to someone who deserves
our loyalty as you do.

663
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,230
- Please forgive me.
- Of course.

664
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,590
I can only say I was angry about
something quite different.

665
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,630
I allowed it to cloud my judgement.

666
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,670
We've all done that, My Lady.

667
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,270
Finally, I'd like you to have this coat.

668
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,070
I... I'm not sure it was a good idea.

669
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,790
Please. Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day,
which is the very last thing I'd want to do.

670
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,110
Furthermore, I want you to keep it.

671
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,750
Well, I...

672
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,480
I've asked Baxter to fit it for you
tonight. She's happy to do that.

673
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,110
Very well, My Lady. I'm very grateful.

674
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,760
I'm not sure when I'll wear it again.

675
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,110
- But you never know.
- You never do.

676
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,320
- I'll say good night.
- Good night, Your Ladyship.

677
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,880
- For Mr Carson.
- Thank you.

678
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,410
- (KNOCKING)
- Come in.

679
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,290
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

680
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
That's lovely.

681
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,690
- What's happened? What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.

682
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,730
We've come to dress the bride.

683
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,720
There's a sentence I
never thought I'd hear.

684
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,730
Ring and...

685
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,770
Ring.

686
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Ohh...

687
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,490
- Mr Brock brought these for you.
- What are they?

688
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,450
They're roses with
heather for buttonholes.

689
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,570
He's done that to one of Mrs Hughes'.

690
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,810
- Very nice, but whom are they for?
- For you and your ushers.

691
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,850
My ushers? I've not got any ushers.

692
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,210
- Perhaps you should
have, Mr Carson. - Oh...

693
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,650
Take one for yourself. Give one to Andrew.

694
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,970
- Remove the fern.
- What about me, Mr Carson?

695
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,140
Take one. I might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb.

696
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,690
For better, for worse,
for richer, for poorer,

697
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,730
in sickness and in health,

698
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,250
to love, cherish, and to obey,

699
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,290
till death us do part.

700
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,940
According to God's holy ordinance...

701
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,730
With this ring, I thee wed.

702
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,530
With my body, I thee worship.

703
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:51,530
All my worldly goods, I thee endow.

704
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,540
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

705
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,060
In the name of the Father and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.

706
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,090
Ohh...

707
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,940
I now pronounce you man and wife together.

708
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
♪ BAGPIPES

709
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,820
Oh, thank you.

710
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,620
(CHEERING)

711
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,490
- I'm so glad to see you here.
- Couldn't miss Carson's wedding.

712
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,050
I felt uncomfortable about the
way I spoke to you the other day.

713
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,290
- You said what you thought.
- I don't think I did. Not truly.

714
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,330
I was exasperated by Lady Grantham.

715
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,970
And you got in the way.

716
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:02,610
Don't be too quick to condemn
yourself. I'm not sure you were wrong.

717
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,370
Maybe I haven't focused on
what's best for the village.

718
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,010
What is this?

719
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,730
Dr Clarkson is reviewing his position.

720
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,770
I hope this is wishful
thinking on Mrs Crawley's part.

721
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,530
To be honest, I don't know.

722
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,090
But if something is that important,
it's worth considering more than once.

723
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:24,210
Really? In my experience, second
thoughts are vastly overrated.

724
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,650
But we mustn't be too blinkered, surely?

725
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,210
It's not just Mrs Crawley
and Lady Grantham.

726
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,130
Your old friend Lord Merton
is in favour of reform.

727
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:37,180
A peer in favour of reform. It's
like a turkey in favour of Christmas.

728
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,380
(CHEERING)

729
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,690
Nice to see you here.

730
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,250
- A wonderful service.
- Thank you, My Lord.

731
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,290
Please understand that
nothing is going to change.

732
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,930
I doubt you'd agree, Mrs... Carson.

733
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,420
We'll try to keep the
changes manageable, My Lady.

734
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,380
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

735
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:19,530
I'm so happy for you. I'm sorry if I
made things awkward about the reception.

736
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,570
Please forgive me.

737
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,420
My Lady, Mr Carson would forgive you
if you attacked him with a brick!

738
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,810
You don't have to worry,
you know, Mr Spratt.

739
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,450
No?

740
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,610
I can keep secrets when I want to.

741
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,380
Maybe. But the question
remains, will you want to?

742
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,610
Ah, mm.

743
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,650
You're very sunny again.

744
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,700
- I love weddings, don't you?
- I liked mine.

745
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,090
You would tell me if you'd
fallen in love with someone else?

746
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,880
I shouldn't think so. Not for a moment.

747
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,530
Because there's something
about you just now.

748
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,170
And there's something about you, Mr Bates.

749
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,650
There's definitely something about you.

750
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
There she is now.

751
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:10,690
You won't regret it. She's
more than equal to the task.

752
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,450
In fact, I think she'll do you credit.

753
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,970
I think she'll do you credit, Mr Molesley.

754
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:19,130
You seem to have been an
excellent influence in all this.

755
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,020
Well, I believe that education is the
gate that leads to any future worth having.

756
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,000
Have you missed your vocation?

757
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,010
I've missed everything, Mr Dawes.

758
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,200
But Daisy doesn't have to.

759
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,130
Mr Mason is so full of
gratitude, Your Ladyship.

760
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,970
It's like a dream after
a nightmare, My Lady.

761
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,010
But please, you mustn't think...

762
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,060
May I have silence?

763
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,970
Thank you.

764
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,010
Mr Barrow.

765
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,850
Before we take our seats,
I believe, as the groom,

766
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,890
that I have the right to a few words.

767
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,610
I will not be prolix,

768
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,130
but it must be right that I mark that
I am the happiest and luckiest of men.

769
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,450
That a woman of such grace and charm

770
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,140
should entrust her life's
happiness to my unworthy charge...

771
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,290
.. passeth all understanding.

772
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:18,690
To my wonderful bride.

773
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,730
The bride and groom!

774
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,770
ALL: The bride and groom!

775
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,810
To the bride and groom.

776
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,850
Ohh!

777
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,890
Tom!

778
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,530
And Sybbie, darling!
What are you doing here?

779
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,650
And how did you know where to find us?

780
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,090
The hall boy on duty
told me where you were.

781
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:38,810
It means that I can
congratulate you in person.

782
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,850
Mr and Mrs Carson.

783
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,890
- Oh, are you back for a holiday?
- Say you'll stay!

784
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,930
That's just the point.

785
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,450
I can stay as long as you want me.

786
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,250
I don't understand. What are you saying?

787
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,210
Just this. That I've come back
and I'd like to stay for good.

788
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,970
- If Lord Grantham will have me.
- Of course we'll have you!

789
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,020
- We'll be delighted!
- I echo every syllable.

790
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,250
Hello, darling Sybbie!

791
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
Give old Donk a kiss!

792
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,130
Tom, this is such wonderful
news. Are you sure?

793
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,250
I'm really, really sure.

794
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,930
So what happened?

795
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,970
It's quite simple.

796
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,930
I had to go all the way to
Boston to figure something out.

797
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,970
- But that's what I did.
- What was it?

798
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,010
I learned that Downton is my home.

799
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,050
And that you are my family.

800
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,500
If I didn't quite know that
before I left, I know it now.

801
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,410
- Sybbie!
- Marigold!

802
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Hello.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:14,370
I think we're all here. I'm
looking forward to this.

2
00:01:14,419 --> 00:01:18,196
You should be at this board meeting.
You're a trustee and the patron.

3
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,507
- Why are they coming here?
- I don't know exactly.

4
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,980
I suppose they have something
they want to tell us.

5
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,410
They obviously need more money.

6
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,411
Right, we're off. See you later.

7
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,541
Who's that? It's not one of
the farmers' wives, is it?

8
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,255
No, I don't think so.

9
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:49,168
Do you really like riding like that?

10
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,361
When a side-saddle is
so much more graceful.

11
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,831
And so much more dangerous.

12
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:57,499
Is Mama right? You're dodging
the hospital meeting?

13
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,219
Only a little bit.

14
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,099
- May I be of assistance?
- No, thank you.

15
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,171
Well, I expect you'll want to get started.

16
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,482
- Started at what?
- Following the hunt.

17
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:17,151
If you go with the others, they'll show
you where to watch them jump the brook.

18
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,591
I see. Ta very much.

19
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:29,028
- Can I lick the bowl?
- Yes.

20
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,182
You can both lick the bowl.

21
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,092
- I enjoyed that.
- Was it your first meet?

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,204
There's not much hunting in Bayswater.

23
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:39,034
Andy, go back and check
that everything's come down.

24
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,771
- I think it has, Mrs Hughes.
- It never hurts to check.

25
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,973
- He's a nice boy.
- He is.

26
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:47,604
And I think I'm showing him
the right way to do things.

27
00:02:47,653 --> 00:02:50,354
I should let him find
his own way, Mr Barrow.

28
00:02:50,405 --> 00:02:52,308
Can I have a piggy-back?

29
00:02:52,358 --> 00:02:54,868
All right, then, but not for long.

30
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,804
- I want to go hunting, too.
- All aboard.

31
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:03,509
- And off we go!
- Faster! Faster!

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,256
- Everything running smoothly?
- Oh, I suppose so.

33
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:09,528
But it's harder with no
kitchen maid, you know.

34
00:03:09,577 --> 00:03:12,757
- Have you settled on a date yet?
- Date?

35
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:15,068
Oh, you mean for the wedding?

36
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,064
No, not yet.

37
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:52,936
Oh, what are you doing up here?

38
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:54,849
The button came off my cuff.

39
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:57,889
I thought I'd mend it
before things got busy.

40
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:01,828
- Shall we go down?
- Before we do...

41
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,335
.. I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.

42
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,577
Whatever makes you say that?

43
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:17,652
- You'll say I'm being stupid.
- Well, maybe you are.

44
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:19,695
Maybe.

45
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:26,781
You see, when I accepted Mr Carson...

46
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,329
- You didn't mean it?
- Oh, yes, I did.

47
00:04:30,378 --> 00:04:32,958
He's a very, very dear man.

48
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:35,350
So, what's the problem?

49
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,137
I hadn't fully considered...

50
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:43,004
all the aspects of marriage.

51
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,077
Of what I was getting into.

52
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,587
I don't understand. What aspects?

53
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,947
You know each other better
than most couples at the start.

54
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,892
Oh, my Lord. You mean...?

55
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:57,991
Yes.

56
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,861
That is precisely what I mean.

57
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:04,528
Well, there's nothing so
terrible about it, is there?

58
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:07,279
So they say. I wouldn't know, of course.

59
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:11,186
Mrs Patmore, look at me. I'm
a woman in late middle age...

60
00:05:11,236 --> 00:05:13,019
Oh, don't say 'late'.

61
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,650
I was not bad-looking as a
girl, if you can believe it.

62
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:18,878
- Very easily.
- But these days?

63
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:22,914
I'm not sure I can let
him see me as I am now.

64
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,373
Perhaps you can keep the lights off.

65
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,123
That is not helpful, Mrs Patmore.

66
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,753
Well, won't he feel the same?

67
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:36,178
I mean, no-one's clapped eyes on
him without his togs for years.

68
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,567
- Except the doctor.
- Good point. Very good point.

69
00:05:39,616 --> 00:05:43,472
Maybe he'd prefer us to leave
that side of things alone.

70
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:47,458
Sorry? Live like brother
and sister, you mean?

71
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,851
A very loving brother and sister.

72
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:53,049
- And that's what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

73
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:58,061
Except not to feel embarrassed and absurd.

74
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,294
Is this why you've not fixed the date?

75
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:03,522
I think we should be clear
about what we're doing.

76
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,922
- Or not doing.
- Yes. Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

77
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:12,263
The trouble is, I don't believe it's
a conversation I can have with him...

78
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:17,754
Oh, you're not suggesting I try?

79
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:19,986
Oh, would you?

80
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:21,948
Oh, by 'eck!

81
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,562
I've had some commissions
in my time, but...

82
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:29,273
It would be such a weight off my mind.

83
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:42,786
Anna? Whatever's happened?

84
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:45,417
Nothing. I'm starting a cold.

85
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:47,460
I'd better get on.

86
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,770
Are you all right?

87
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:41,023
Of course. No bones broken, anyway.

88
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,696
Thanks to nice Mr Fairclough here.

89
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:45,129
Very kind of you, Fairclough.
Good to see you out.

90
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,078
I never like to miss a day's
hunt when it's on my doorstep.

91
00:07:48,128 --> 00:07:50,788
- Shall I take you back to the
house, m'lady? - Certainly not.

92
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:53,300
If you can just give me a hand up.

93
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:03,186
I'm not taking any sort of 'tone'.

94
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:06,305
I'm just reminding you of the deadline.

95
00:08:07,101 --> 00:08:09,175
Thank you. Goodbye.

96
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:12,751
Trouble at the mill?

97
00:08:12,802 --> 00:08:15,104
My editor, Mr Skinner, again.

98
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,775
- What's the problem?
- Everything's a problem.

99
00:08:17,825 --> 00:08:21,680
No, that's not quite true.
I think the problem is me.

100
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:25,587
He doesn't like working for
a woman. Simple as that.

101
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:29,055
I suppose you're right, not
selling up and taking the money.

102
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,048
I think I am.

103
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:34,914
Andrew, please ask Mrs
Hughes to organise tea for...

104
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:38,980
- I'm not sure. Can you count them
as they arrive? - Very good, m'lady.

105
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,772
- When did you learn about this?
- What do you mean?

106
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,565
Well, you seem to have all the facts,

107
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:45,677
when it's the first
time we've heard of it.

108
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:47,591
What does that matter?

109
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,258
The fact is that the Royal
Yorkshire County Hospital

110
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:54,567
wants to take over our little hospital,

111
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:56,959
which is outrageous.

112
00:08:57,008 --> 00:09:00,187
- But it's not as simple as that.
- Why not?

113
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:02,618
Because there may be
benefits for the village.

114
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:05,847
If we form such a partnership,
our patients would have access

115
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,836
to more modern equipment,
to more advanced treatments.

116
00:09:08,887 --> 00:09:10,870
Our fundraising would be more efficient.

117
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,815
And the price of the fundraising
would be to lose all control,

118
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:18,921
and to become the tools of a
faceless committee in York.

119
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:21,273
What matters more? Health or power?

120
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:25,101
What matters is to have power over
the maintenance of our own health.

121
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,288
- Ladies, ladies, please...
- Lady Grantham is right.

122
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:31,238
Our independence is not
something we should just abandon

123
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,830
without a second thought.

124
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,257
- How did you find out about this?
- They wrote to me.

125
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:41,243
Who did? I'm the hospital
Almoner. Nobody's written to me.

126
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,792
Ever since you took that position,
you talk as if you run the place.

127
00:09:44,841 --> 00:09:46,426
I do run the place!

128
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:49,376
Or, at least, I know every
detail of how it's run.

129
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,085
And I ought to be told
about any proposed changes.

130
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:55,355
- You're being told now.
- If you must know, it was a friend,

131
00:09:55,404 --> 00:09:58,464
on the board in York,
who whispered it to me.

132
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,297
They'll write to all of us soon.

133
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:03,447
So, you want to protect your power
at the expense of the patients.

134
00:10:03,497 --> 00:10:06,954
I want to protect the patients
at the expense of my power.

135
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:09,436
And may the best man win.

136
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,043
I'm glad we agree on this.

137
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,131
Don't let's make too much of it.

138
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:20,676
I'm fine.

139
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:24,262
Good afternoon.

140
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:35,255
I'm going in.

141
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:37,527
I'm completely whacked.

142
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:39,569
Don't tell your mother.

143
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:43,824
Can you make sure he gets a
proper rub-down? He did well.

144
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,868
Yes, m'lady.

145
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,979
- Who are you?
- Rita Bevan.

146
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,292
Don't you know me, Lady
Mary? Cos I know you.

147
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,773
No. I do not know you.

148
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,074
And I suppose you have forgotten

149
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,148
the Grand Hotel in Liverpool, too, m'lady?

150
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,500
And your nights there
with Viscount Gillingham?

151
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:12,774
I was a chambermaid. But I suppose
we're invisible to people like you.

152
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:15,913
This is all nonsense. You've no proof.

153
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:18,743
Don't be silly. You
don't know what I've got.

154
00:11:18,793 --> 00:11:21,096
To start with, I've got
a page from the register.

155
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:23,486
- Then you are a thief.
- Yes, I am a thief,

156
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:26,755
and I want a thousand pounds
to keep my mouth shut.

157
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:29,187
That's ridiculous.

158
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:31,698
We'll see how ridiculous it is.

159
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:34,300
I'm going now, but I'll be back.

160
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:38,635
Don't bother. You're not the first
person who's tried to blackmail me.

161
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:43,905
Well, I'm glad you know how it
works. And as I say, I will be back.

162
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:52,202
- Penny for your thoughts.
- They're not worth as much.

163
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:56,188
- They would be to me.
- Oh, I'm worn out. Give me some tea.

164
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,181
You let those children run you ragged.

165
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:01,129
Thank you. I've had Miss Marigold
on my back since luncheon.

166
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,080
- How lucky is that child?
- Why do you say that?

167
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:07,866
Well, what was she? A farmer's daughter.

168
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,820
Until she caught the eye of Lady Edith.

169
00:12:09,869 --> 00:12:12,450
Now she'll grow up in the
bosom of a great family

170
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,244
and live her life accordingly.

171
00:12:14,294 --> 00:12:18,180
I don't believe she has any
greater guarantee of happiness.

172
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:21,390
That's Lady Mary, back from the hunt.

173
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,997
I know you don't approve, but
it's quite ordinary in London now.

174
00:12:28,045 --> 00:12:31,035
- Will that be all, my Lord?
- Yes, thank you.

175
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,373
At least... there is something.

176
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:36,366
This is part of a larger conversation,

177
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:38,399
but at some point we need to discuss

178
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,871
future staffing requirements at Downton.

179
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:42,983
We have cut down quite a bit, my Lord.

180
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:45,535
We've only got one hall
boy and two housemaids,

181
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:48,245
and as kitchen staff have
left, we've not replaced them.

182
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:50,638
I know, and there's no
need for anything drastic.

183
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,508
The estate's doing well, thanks
to Mr Crawley and Mr Branson,

184
00:12:53,556 --> 00:12:56,456
but I don't like to feel out
of step with my fellow man.

185
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,290
As a matter of fact,

186
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,801
both the housemaids have
handed in their notice.

187
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,875
I was going to tell you.

188
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:06,063
- Oh. Were they unhappy? I hope not.
- No, no, no.

189
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,734
One is leaving to get married,
which we knew was coming,

190
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:12,681
and Madge has found a job in a shop.

191
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:15,031
Which is better than working here?

192
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:19,257
She says that her young man wants
her to be free in the evenings.

193
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:22,168
I must ask you to remember, my Lord,

194
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:27,189
that there were six footmen when I
first came here and five housemaids.

195
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,298
Now we've got to two of each
and no kitchen maids at all.

196
00:13:30,348 --> 00:13:33,168
We must run this place
as it should be run.

197
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:35,082
I'm not asking you to wield a scythe,

198
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,839
but, I mean, who has an
under-butler these days?

199
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:42,706
If I could stop history in
its tracks, maybe I would.

200
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,954
- But I can't, Carson. Nor you, nor I
can hold back time. - Unfortunately.

201
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:52,821
The Dowager Countess has arrived, my Lord.

202
00:13:52,869 --> 00:13:54,862
Hmm.

203
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:59,039
- She definitely waited on you?
- Well, she knows I was there

204
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,633
with Lord Gillingham.

205
00:14:00,683 --> 00:14:03,384
- Are you going to pay her?
- A thousand pounds? Don't be mad.

206
00:14:03,433 --> 00:14:05,536
If I pay her, she'll only come back.

207
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,765
- What will you do, then?
- Nothing, until I have to.

208
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,758
Why should a paper print it, anyway?

209
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,508
'Earl's daughter in love
tryst with married viscount'?

210
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,741
He wasn't married then. Nor was I.

211
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,614
It's still a good story.

212
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:21,400
Anyway, what about YOUR
story? Is there any more news?

213
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:24,430
You must still be on bail,
or else you'd have told me.

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,854
We both are, in a way. At least,
I'm on bail and he's on tenterhooks,

215
00:14:28,905 --> 00:14:31,764
until they decide if they can
make a case against either of us.

216
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:36,228
- What does Sergeant Willis say?
- Nothing, and Mr Willis isn't unkind.

217
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,903
He'd have told us if it was over.

218
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:40,732
- No wonder you're upset.
- Why do you say that?

219
00:14:40,783 --> 00:14:43,563
You just seemed a bit down in
the mouth, when you came in.

220
00:14:43,613 --> 00:14:49,104
- Never mind me. Now, what shall
we do about your hair? - Mm.

221
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,017
You'll be very late going down.

222
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,565
I wouldn't have washed it, but I
came off, and it was full of mud.

223
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:57,076
You'll just have to do your best.

224
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,816
- You're very quiet.
- I've got a lot on my mind.

225
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:04,968
A problem shared is a problem halved.

226
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,841
Huh! Or doubled.

227
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:08,755
Ah, there you are.

228
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,864
They're down, Mrs Patmore -- I'll
announce it when you're ready.

229
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:15,293
No, I'm ready now. The first course
is cold, so it's already up there.

230
00:15:15,342 --> 00:15:20,314
- Very good. - Oh, could I have a
word? When you're done for the night.

231
00:15:20,365 --> 00:15:23,304
- May I know what about?
- I'll tell you then.

232
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,825
It's nothing bad. At least...

233
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:28,775
No, I'll tell you then.

234
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,606
Hm.

235
00:15:35,033 --> 00:15:38,173
I don't think Mr Molesley meant
to be unkind about Miss Marigold.

236
00:15:38,223 --> 00:15:39,967
I'm sure he didn't.

237
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,118
Only, it seemed to put
you in a strange mood.

238
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:43,992
Did it?

239
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,906
It's ironic.

240
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:48,896
So many children in need of a home,

241
00:15:48,944 --> 00:15:51,536
and so many homes in need of a child.

242
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,386
My God, what have I said?

243
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,813
My darling, what have I said?

244
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:04,730
It's not your fault.

245
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:09,952
Only... I thought I was pregnant.

246
00:16:11,546 --> 00:16:13,608
And then, this morning...

247
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:17,087
Well, anyway, now I'm not.

248
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:19,907
You should have told me.

249
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:22,487
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

250
00:16:22,627 --> 00:16:24,690
You weren't to know that would happen.

251
00:16:24,739 --> 00:16:26,732
But, you see, I was.

252
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:30,320
Because it's happened before. Twice.

253
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:35,063
I can't do it. I'm not able.

254
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,994
There is no proof of that.

255
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,465
But if you're not, you're not.

256
00:16:43,514 --> 00:16:45,507
We'll be all right.

257
00:16:46,663 --> 00:16:48,656
I've let you down.

258
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:52,703
There are no words less true than those.

259
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,665
You could never let me down.

260
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:01,402
Besides, we've had so many troubles.

261
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:04,271
There isn't a couple in the world

262
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,982
who've had as many worries as we have.

263
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,111
So, what did Tom have to say?

264
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,219
He's found a flat with a garden
and Sybbie's happy at her school.

265
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,448
- Speaking in an American accent.
- Would that be so awful?

266
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:27,912
Poor Tom. If he was a fish out of
water here, what is he in Boston?

267
00:17:27,962 --> 00:17:29,787
A fish back in water, I'd have thought.

268
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,979
There's a tremendous
Irish community there.

269
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:34,730
If you ask me, he's landed on his feet.

270
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:37,241
How is the search going
for his replacement?

271
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,955
We've hardly started, really.

272
00:17:39,005 --> 00:17:41,745
We haven't started at all.
We don't need a replacement.

273
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:44,775
- Why not?
- Because I'm his replacement.

274
00:17:44,823 --> 00:17:47,325
- I'm going to be the new agent.
- You're what?

275
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:50,674
We've worked together since he came
back from Dublin. Why shouldn't I?

276
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:53,822
- Quite right.
- Yes, but what about the heavy lifting?

277
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,051
Granny, I think I can lift quite
as much as sad old Mr Jarvis,

278
00:17:57,101 --> 00:17:58,726
before Matthew chased him away.

279
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:00,480
Brains count for more than muscles.

280
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,312
Long live women's rights and all that,

281
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,023
but it's not a good idea to
take on a job that wears you out.

282
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:07,016
- I'm doing it now, aren't I?
- Yes.

283
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:09,369
But you'll be dead by the
year's end at this rate.

284
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,955
I suppose we only know what we're
capable of when we test our limits.

285
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,348
And we certainly know
what you're capable of.

286
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:17,180
What is that supposed to mean?

287
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,135
Isobel, what's Granny done wrong?

288
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,128
We're to have a fight about the hospital,

289
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:23,400
and she began it by concealing the facts.

290
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:28,063
- Oh, dear. - It seems to me we should --
- Cora, don't waste your time on it.

291
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:30,454
It's a matter between
me and Cousin Isobel.

292
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:33,843
We can't have the President in a
tug-of-war against the Almoner.

293
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:35,636
We can if it's needed.

294
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:38,217
With poor old Clarkson as the rope.

295
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,240
Is now a good time?

296
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,283
As good as any. Sit.

297
00:18:50,674 --> 00:18:53,256
- Some of this?
- No, thank you.

298
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:56,245
Erm... well...

299
00:18:56,294 --> 00:19:00,071
The thing is, I've been speaking
to Mrs Hughes about your marriage.

300
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:03,339
- Oh, yes?
- And I was wondering about...

301
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,170
At least, we were both
discussing the terms

302
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,601
on which you intend to live.

303
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,033
Good terms, I hope...

304
00:19:11,082 --> 00:19:13,504
- Are you sure?
- Go on, then.

305
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:17,291
You see, we were talking
of how it will be,

306
00:19:17,342 --> 00:19:20,998
sharing your life after
so many years on your own.

307
00:19:21,048 --> 00:19:23,600
That's the nub of it -- I agree.

308
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:28,252
Because you've got used to
doing things in a certain way.

309
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:29,808
It's true. I have.

310
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:32,399
But I like to think that
I'm not too old to change.

311
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:34,791
No, of course not.

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:40,500
But do you expect to... to share your...

313
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:46,230
- .. way of life?
- Doesn't everyone when they marry?

314
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:48,143
I suppose.

315
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:50,943
So, what can I do for you?

316
00:19:51,582 --> 00:19:53,365
Nothing.

317
00:19:53,415 --> 00:19:57,272
Oh... oh, it was very
nice, having a little chat.

318
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,514
And thank you for the port.

319
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:04,606
But I'll leave you to it now.

320
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,359
Hmm.

321
00:20:10,116 --> 00:20:12,937
Are you plotting something?

322
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:16,445
You sound like a governess
in fear of dismissal.

323
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:19,634
You sound like a guilty party, who's
trying to throw me off the scent.

324
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:23,500
Is something on your mind, Robert?
You seem a bit troubled lately.

325
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,862
Do I? Well, maybe I am.

326
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,482
To be honest, I'm starting to ask myself

327
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,436
how much longer we can go on with it all.

328
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:33,426
- Well, go on with what?
- The household. The servants.

329
00:20:33,475 --> 00:20:36,655
- You're not in
difficulties, are you? - No.

330
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:41,238
But a butler, under-butler,
footmen, a valet, ladies' maids...

331
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:44,587
to say nothing of the housemaids,
the kitchen, the laundry, the --

332
00:20:44,637 --> 00:20:47,655
Yes, well, you...

333
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,805
you think it's a bit too much in 1925?

334
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:55,189
The wage bill is three times
what it was before the war.

335
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:59,535
Soon it will be worse. And anyway,
who lives as we used to, now?

336
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:02,205
Well, I don't think you'll
see much change at the Palace.

337
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:05,872
The Royal Family, then, the dukes,
some others, and good luck to them.

338
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,264
But most people are cutting down.

339
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:11,772
It seems hard that men and women
should lose their livelihoods

340
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,685
because it's gone out of fashion.

341
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:15,679
But what if they could find work?

342
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:18,836
Well, how many do you see going?

343
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:22,704
I don't know, but some.

344
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:31,154
Granny was on form.

345
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:35,050
I ought to go up to London soon.

346
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,602
- Is this your editor?
- Partly him.

347
00:21:37,652 --> 00:21:39,436
I must get him back on track.

348
00:21:39,484 --> 00:21:42,305
But my tenant's also moving
out at the end of the month.

349
00:21:42,355 --> 00:21:46,022
- Out of Michael Gregson's flat?
- Out of MY flat.

350
00:21:47,338 --> 00:21:50,597
But, anyway, I'm not
quite sure what to do.

351
00:21:50,646 --> 00:21:52,669
Should I smarten it up
and let it out again?

352
00:21:52,718 --> 00:21:55,898
Or would it be good for me
to have my own London base?

353
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,940
It's a thought.

354
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,881
Anyway, I'm off to bed. Good night.

355
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,923
Good night.

356
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:12,839
Edith alone on the town.
What will she get up to?

357
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,877
At her age, she's entitled
to get up to something.

358
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,283
- What's the matter?
- Why do you ask?

359
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,442
I... just worry about you.

360
00:22:23,492 --> 00:22:25,515
I'm your father. It's allowed.

361
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:28,494
What makes you think
anything's the matter?

362
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,766
How was dinner? Did you enjoy it?

363
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:38,349
Quite. I'm afraid the times are
catching up with the Abbey, too,

364
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,742
as they were bound to, I suppose.

365
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,332
How do you mean, m'lady?

366
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:45,973
Well, the way they run things there.

367
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,102
They're not going to lay off staff?

368
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,739
- Don't say anything.
- Oh, I'm a veritable tomb

369
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,529
where other people's secrets
are concerned, m'lady.

370
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,121
- It won't affect us.
- I hope not.

371
00:22:58,171 --> 00:22:59,993
Oh, no.

372
00:23:00,043 --> 00:23:02,784
We're down to the bare bones, as it is.

373
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:06,412
You're right. Things are
positively frugal around here.

374
00:23:06,461 --> 00:23:10,279
I do worry about those who'll have to go.

375
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:13,069
But remember, no talking.

376
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,112
M'lady.

377
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,151
- How did you get on last night?
- Oh...

378
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,180
Er... Daisy, fetch that coconut ice.

379
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:34,561
I'd like Mrs Hughes to try it.

380
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:39,634
Not very well. I couldn't
seem to get to the subject.

381
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:42,584
- Was he putting you off?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

382
00:23:42,634 --> 00:23:45,772
But it was a difficult topic to arrive at.

383
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:48,403
Erm... excuse me. I hope you can help me.

384
00:23:48,452 --> 00:23:50,636
I've got a message for
Lady Mary from the Dowager.

385
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:52,310
She said it's urgent.

386
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,740
If you give it to me, I'll
get someone to take it.

387
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:57,969
Lady Grantham said I was to
put it into Lady Mary's hand.

388
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,757
I'm sorry, Miss, but we don't know
you, and Lady Mary isn't down yet.

389
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,666
I'm Ellen Gorse. I've just
started at the Dower House.

390
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:07,217
I've only got to give her an envelope.

391
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:09,858
Very well. I'll take you to her room.

392
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:17,791
Yes?

393
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:22,006
Sorry to bother you,
m'lady, but the Dowager

394
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:24,677
has sent a message for you.
Apparently, it's urgent.

395
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:28,064
- I doubt it.
- I haven't got it, m'lady.

396
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,736
She sent a maid to put it into your hand.

397
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:34,722
How mysterious. Well,
where is this Mercury maid?

398
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,764
Here, m'lady.

399
00:24:39,236 --> 00:24:41,618
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

400
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:43,890
We mustn't delay you.

401
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,963
Can you send Anna up?

402
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:48,004
Of course, m'lady.

403
00:24:50,836 --> 00:24:53,764
- How dare you?
- I dare more than you dare.

404
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:58,080
You could have asked her to
throw me out. Why didn't you?

405
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,521
It would only make things worse.

406
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,979
It'll be a lot worse when you're
sprawled over the centre pages

407
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:06,132
of the News Of The World.

408
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:08,174
You're revolting.

409
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,712
Can't you see that none of
that stuff works with me?

410
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:15,340
- What stuff?
- La-di-da, gracious great lady.

411
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,930
You think you're so marvellous, don't you?

412
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:21,718
Your lot's finished. You're
going down and we're coming up.

413
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:23,511
The working classes may be coming up,

414
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,265
but I'd be very surprised if you are.

415
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,178
Now, please get out.

416
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:28,892
- Can I have the money?
- No.

417
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,323
You'd only come back for more.

418
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,077
Suppose I gave you my word?

419
00:25:33,127 --> 00:25:35,628
If I wasn't so disgusted,
that would make me laugh.

420
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,335
- I was just on my way up --
- This is Miss Bevan, whom I told you about.

421
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:42,495
- How did you get in here?
- How do you think? I lied.

422
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:45,913
Now, you've got one more chance,
and that'll be your last.

423
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:48,264
You must be a glutton for punishment.

424
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,775
Now, Anna, can you make sure she leaves?

425
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,818
Certainly, m'lady.

426
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,163
Mr Molesley's been on
at me about my exams.

427
00:26:17,213 --> 00:26:20,313
Ooh, I don't envy you. I still
cheer myself up by thinking,

428
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:22,744
at least I don't have
to take any more exams.

429
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:25,893
But he's right. I must take
them, or what's it all been for?

430
00:26:25,943 --> 00:26:29,879
Ooh, it doesn't look as if she'll
be staying on at the Dower House.

431
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:32,790
No. I wouldn't have said she
was a long-term prospect.

432
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,464
Not very congenial.

433
00:26:34,514 --> 00:26:37,244
'Ey, I wonder what was in that message.

434
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:43,156
I suppose you're surprised to see
me lining up with the Dowager.

435
00:26:43,204 --> 00:26:44,870
Only because I think you're wrong.

436
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:47,540
Well, you have a touching
faith in officialdom.

437
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,253
Once they take over the hospital,

438
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:52,563
they will lay down the law, with no
regard for the needs of this area.

439
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:56,001
I've seen it in war and in
peace -- it's always the same.

440
00:26:57,873 --> 00:26:59,578
Do you not care?

441
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:02,368
I'll tell you what I care
about. It's not complicated.

442
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:04,720
I care about survival rates.

443
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,629
Mrs Crawley, I'm sure you
don't intend to be offensive...

444
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,982
No, but I intend to be
truthful. I'm the Almoner.

445
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:12,214
I know the facts about
this place as well as you.

446
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,841
So, this isn't something Lord
Merton has persuaded you into?

447
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,034
- Lord Merton?
- You remember him, surely?

448
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:21,013
That famous fount of
all medical knowledge.

449
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,418
Well, I wish you luck
with your fellow warrior.

450
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:29,074
What is it they say? Rather you than me.

451
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:31,148
Good day.

452
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:39,399
You've got a visitor. Sergeant Willis.

453
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,029
- What does he want?
- Search me. He's in Mr Carson's room.

454
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,212
Mr Bates is there already.

455
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:48,607
But surely, if a woman's
confessed, that's the end of it?

456
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:52,433
Not quite. Inspector Vyner thinks
it may be a false confession.

457
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:55,344
You do get people coming forward
who had nothing to do with it.

458
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:57,176
But haven't they checked her story?

459
00:27:57,226 --> 00:28:00,087
If she's one of his victims,
people must have seen her with him.

460
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,478
That's the point. They
can't prove a connection.

461
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,266
She says Mr Green picked her up in a
pub, but no-one can corroborate it.

462
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:08,577
We can't send her to
prison if she's delusional.

463
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:11,646
- Then why have you come here?
- Because it's your right to know

464
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:13,321
that someone had confessed.

465
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,592
How did she know Mr Green
would be in Piccadilly?

466
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:19,539
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
She just saw him standing there.

467
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:22,210
Did he speak to her,
like the witness said?

468
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,325
He spoke. He belittled
her and he laughed at her.

469
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:30,301
- And she pushed him.
- I believe she's telling the truth.

470
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:33,899
And I'm certain it'll come
right. Just keep the faith.

471
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,407
Good day.

472
00:28:41,712 --> 00:28:45,248
How stupid of him. To come here
before there was any proof.

473
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,442
Don't be harsh. He meant well.

474
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,684
Meaning well is not enough.

475
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,456
A letter from Rose, to us all.

476
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:57,047
- How does she sound?
- Hectic and happy.

477
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:59,479
New York seems to suit her.

478
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,629
M'lord, William Mason's
father is downstairs.

479
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:04,343
Oh? What does he want?

480
00:29:04,393 --> 00:29:07,851
It seems the owners of the estate
where he's a tenant are selling up.

481
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,282
- What? - The Darnleys
are selling Mallerton?

482
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,995
I find that very hard to believe.

483
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,786
So did he, my Lord, but now
there's to be an auction

484
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,137
of the contents of the house on the tenth.

485
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,728
You astonish me. But what can I do?

486
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:23,277
He wonders if you could put in a
word for him to keep his tenancy.

487
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:25,469
How does he know that's
not what they intend?

488
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,499
- He's had a letter giving notice.
- Oh, it may be a formality.

489
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,452
They have to sell with vacant possession,

490
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:32,165
but the new owners may keep him on.

491
00:29:32,216 --> 00:29:35,036
He just wonders if you could
find out what his chances are.

492
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:38,662
- Can't he ask them himself?
- You'd be more likely to get an answer.

493
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,935
I hope it's not an impertinence.

494
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:44,322
No. He was William's father.
He's Daisy's father-in-law.

495
00:29:44,372 --> 00:29:46,396
He enjoys privileges in this house.

496
00:29:46,446 --> 00:29:48,230
That's what I thought, my Lord.

497
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,937
Well, I don't mind telephoning.
Is Mason in the servants' hall?

498
00:29:51,987 --> 00:29:54,766
Give him a drink, and I'll ring
down if I can make contact.

499
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,809
Very good, my Lord.

500
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,942
- So, what are you going to say?
- I've heard they're selling.

501
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,014
I might know someone who's interested,

502
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,728
but I thought I'd check first.

503
00:30:05,777 --> 00:30:08,917
Very ingenious. You would
have made a good courtier.

504
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:11,359
I would not. Too much standing.

505
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:16,012
Ah, Mrs Hughes...

506
00:30:16,063 --> 00:30:18,843
You don't think maybe you
should start calling me Elsie?

507
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:21,354
Not here. Not while we're working.

508
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,136
- Go on, then.
- I wish we could settle the date.

509
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:28,320
There's no rush, is there?

510
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:39,091
- Mr Mason. His Lordship's
ringing them now. - Thank you.

511
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,285
But they can't just tell you to go.

512
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,393
Not when you and your dad have
put in so many years there.

513
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:47,742
They've given me notice, and I
shall have some compensation,

514
00:30:47,792 --> 00:30:50,532
but in the end, I'm
just a tenant, aren't I?

515
00:30:50,581 --> 00:30:53,522
- That's not how I see it.
- It doesn't matter how you see it.

516
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:55,754
That's how it is.

517
00:30:55,803 --> 00:30:57,796
Hello!

518
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:01,304
Ah, hello.

519
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,640
Hello, Miss Denker.
What's your mission today?

520
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,751
Not stirring any trouble up, I hope.

521
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:12,097
- Me? Now, why would you say that?
- I can't imagine (!)

522
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:15,524
- No, I've come here to sympathise.
- Sympathise? What with?

523
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:19,392
News that the household here's
to be reduced. I am sorry.

524
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:22,779
- What? Where did this come from?
- Oh, she never disappoints.

525
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,411
I suppose that's me gone,
then. Last in, first out.

526
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:26,765
You don't know that.

527
00:31:26,816 --> 00:31:30,313
I suppose it comes down to who's
useful and who's ornamental.

528
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:32,186
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Barrow?

529
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,100
If it's all right with you, Miss Denker,

530
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:35,973
I'd rather talk to the organ-grinder.

531
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:39,241
Oh, dear. I do hope I
haven't cast a shadow.

532
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:42,869
What did you think you were
doing? Sprinkling sunshine?

533
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:46,019
- By the way, when did that new
maid start? - What new maid?

534
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:48,490
She came here with a
message from Her Ladyship.

535
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,442
I haven't the first idea who that c... --

536
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,486
Oh, that's the library.

537
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,977
Mr Mason, you'd better come up with me.

538
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,849
Andrew, what are you doing down here?

539
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:03,478
- Mr Molesley thought we might need more milk.
- Well, get it, then.

540
00:32:03,527 --> 00:32:07,353
Mr Carson... did you know anything
about staff being laid off?

541
00:32:08,868 --> 00:32:12,047
It's not a subject for the here and now.

542
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:14,160
Are you ready, Mr Mason?

543
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,455
- Naturally, Sir John is very upset by it all.
- I should think he is.

544
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,162
Unfortunately, they couldn't sell the
estate without vacant possession.

545
00:32:25,212 --> 00:32:28,431
- So, it's sold now?
- Yes. At least, they think so.

546
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,459
- And I have to go.
- Not necessarily.

547
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:33,612
That would be the
decision of the new owners.

548
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:36,013
I see. Well...

549
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:39,352
Thank you very much for
putting in a word, m'lord.

550
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:42,820
If I hear anything more, I'll
make sure Daisy knows it.

551
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,863
Thank you.

552
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:49,318
Poor man.

553
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:53,382
To have his whole future hanging
in the balance, at his time of life.

554
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:55,297
These are days of uncertainty.

555
00:32:55,347 --> 00:32:58,455
- How was John when you spoke to him?
- In a state.

556
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:01,037
They're throwing in the towel.

557
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:04,305
He says, once the debts are paid,
there won't be too much left.

558
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:06,697
Tim's emigrating to Kenya.

559
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:10,363
Poor Marian. To be separated
from her only son.

560
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:12,635
She'll hate that.

561
00:33:12,686 --> 00:33:15,466
- I said we'd go to the sale.
- Do you want to?

562
00:33:15,516 --> 00:33:18,136
Well, John's father and my
papa were as thick as thieves.

563
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:20,886
It might be nice to find
a memento of the old boy.

564
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:23,478
How was Granny?

565
00:33:23,527 --> 00:33:26,747
- Getting ready for a fight.
- Run to Mummy, Georgie.

566
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,785
Hello, darling.

567
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:33,922
I wish you'd stay out of it. Not
least because she's bound to win.

568
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,555
Nobody ever stops her.

569
00:33:35,606 --> 00:33:38,596
What you mean is, no-one
has stopped her YET.

570
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,430
- Can I help you, Miss Denker?
- No.

571
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,699
I'm just tidying Her Ladyship's papers.

572
00:33:51,749 --> 00:33:53,971
She'll be down in a minute.

573
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:57,081
- I'll tell Mrs Potter.
- Oh, how very reassuring.

574
00:33:57,131 --> 00:34:00,549
The butler giving the
cook an early warning.

575
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,791
What are you talking about?

576
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:06,766
- No. I don't want to worry you.
- Worry me with what?

577
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:09,756
Oh, well, if you must know,

578
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:12,986
there's going to be a shortening
of the wages bill around here.

579
00:34:13,034 --> 00:34:15,497
But why burden ourselves?

580
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:18,048
What can we do? Que sera, sera.

581
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,556
Are you trying to suggest, in
your usual, maladroit fashion,

582
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,588
that our jobs are in peril?

583
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:26,218
Well, I hate to sound smug, Mr Spratt,

584
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:28,492
but I would suggest that Her Ladyship

585
00:34:28,541 --> 00:34:30,923
will always need to dress and undress.

586
00:34:30,972 --> 00:34:34,351
Ooh, while a butler is a luxury?
Is that what you're saying?

587
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,902
My advice, Mr Spratt, is
to live for the moment.

588
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,941
We none of us know what
the future will bring.

589
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:44,356
Ah, I've put your spectacles
over there, m'lady.

590
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:47,544
Thank you, Denker. Spratt, I'll
have dinner whenever it's ready.

591
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:49,617
Would you tell Mrs Potter?

592
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,136
I will, m'lady, although you
could have rung for her yourself.

593
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:56,114
I beg your pardon?

594
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:59,155
I was just thinking
aloud, m'lady. I'm sorry.

595
00:34:59,593 --> 00:35:01,925
I was... I was thinking aloud.

596
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:10,704
Have you decided what to do
if that Miss Bevan returns?

597
00:35:10,753 --> 00:35:12,857
Not yet.

598
00:35:12,907 --> 00:35:15,209
If I pay her, I've a blood-sucking vampire

599
00:35:15,257 --> 00:35:17,281
on my back for the rest of my life.

600
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,642
If I refuse, I'm ruined.

601
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,513
What would you do?

602
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:26,609
Don't be blackmailed, m'lady.

603
00:35:27,096 --> 00:35:29,847
I know it's easy to say, but don't.

604
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:33,106
I think I agree. If I'm strong enough.

605
00:35:33,593 --> 00:35:36,533
Either way, my life's up the spout,

606
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,965
and though I hate the idea of scandal,

607
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,806
somehow the shadow of blackmail is worse.

608
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,108
The cheek of her.

609
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:47,097
It was all I could do
not to give her a slap.

610
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:50,235
- Will there be anything else?
- No. Thank you.

611
00:35:54,002 --> 00:35:58,666
We may have our problems, the both
of us, but we'll get through them.

612
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:11,671
- Could you spare me a minute?
- If you like.

613
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:14,261
Come along to my pantry.

614
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:17,171
I have a feeling that we
never quite got to the reason

615
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:19,006
for your visit last night.

616
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:21,157
No. That's correct.

617
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,117
Only, I'm asking myself...

618
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,133
Were you a messenger from Mrs Hughes?

619
00:36:28,184 --> 00:36:30,246
You could say that, yes.

620
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,595
You were on a mission for her?

621
00:36:33,645 --> 00:36:35,638
Yes. It's true.

622
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:43,081
Mrs Patmore, did she ask you to
tell me she's changed her mind?

623
00:36:43,132 --> 00:36:45,473
What? No!

624
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:47,705
Well, not exactly.

625
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,978
I'm waiting.

626
00:36:50,027 --> 00:36:51,971
Well, that is all very fine,

627
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,079
but it's hard for me to
talk about such things.

628
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,461
Now I'm on the edge of my seat.

629
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,129
Oh, it's no good. I
shall have to look away.

630
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:07,037
You see, she is a very
proud woman, Mr Carson.

631
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,470
I know that, and I respect her for it.

632
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,578
And she would never want to
appear ridiculous in your eyes.

633
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:15,329
- Nor could she.
- No, but...

634
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:18,239
as your wife, she wonders

635
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,281
if you would expect...

636
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:25,424
(.. that she perform her wifely duties.)

637
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,281
Don't wives normally perform their duties?

638
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:31,322
Good wives, any...

639
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:39,604
- Oh. - Yes. That's it.
I think we've got there.

640
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:41,637
I do believe we have.

641
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:45,305
She needs to know if
that's what you anticipate.

642
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:47,298
A full marriage.

643
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,341
As opposed to...?

644
00:37:49,778 --> 00:37:52,719
Living together in
companionship, I suppose.

645
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:55,559
In friendship. Warm friendship, I'm sure.

646
00:37:56,316 --> 00:38:01,050
Is that what she's
offering? Warm friendship?

647
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:04,168
She has to know what you expect.

648
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,722
Ever think of a time when we're told
the whole Mr Green business is over?

649
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:20,511
- Of course I do. - We could start
to plan again, revive our dreams.

650
00:38:21,547 --> 00:38:24,936
You mean your old dream of
a house full of children?

651
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,872
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:28,922 --> 00:38:31,753
That's the end of the self-pity. I swear.

653
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:37,203
If they'll just leave us alone,
I'll be happy, whatever comes.

654
00:38:37,253 --> 00:38:39,077
No, you won't.

655
00:38:39,126 --> 00:38:42,115
At least, not as happy
as you could have been.

656
00:38:42,594 --> 00:38:44,926
But it's nice of you to say it.

657
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:49,810
Well...

658
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,988
That was an awkward mission
for you, if you like.

659
00:38:53,037 --> 00:38:54,821
Oh, I'll say.

660
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:57,860
I'm sorry if you're
embarrassed, because I am.

661
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,162
I'm not embarrassed, exactly.

662
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,272
I do not believe that embarrassment
has much of a part to play

663
00:39:03,322 --> 00:39:06,591
when something is as important as this.

664
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:10,835
But what am I to tell her?

665
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,915
Tell her this, Mrs Patmore.

666
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:16,636
That, in my eyes, she is beautiful.

667
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,018
I see.

668
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:23,761
You say she asks if I
want a 'full' marriage...

669
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,876
and the answer is... yes, I do.

670
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:32,131
I want a real marriage, a true marriage,

671
00:39:32,182 --> 00:39:35,171
with everything that that involves...

672
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:39,347
.. and I hope I do not ask the indelicate

673
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:42,455
when I send you back
to relay this message.

674
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,499
Don't worry about me.

675
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:50,317
I love her, Mrs Patmore.

676
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,653
I am happy and tickled and...

677
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:57,921
bursting with pride

678
00:39:57,972 --> 00:40:00,563
that she would agree to be my wife.

679
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,296
And I want us to live as
closely as two people can,

680
00:40:05,345 --> 00:40:08,135
for the time that remains to us on earth.

681
00:40:09,372 --> 00:40:11,952
Well, you couldn't make it any clearer.

682
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:13,996
I'll say that for you.

683
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,902
And if she feels that she must...

684
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,210
.. withdraw...

685
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:25,396
.. so be it.

686
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:31,733
But I could never have lived
some... pat-a-cake friendship lie.

687
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,481
No. I didn't think you would.

688
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:40,931
And for what it's worth, I wish
you the best of luck, Mr Carson.

689
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,975
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

690
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:50,547
That is worth a great deal.

691
00:40:58,201 --> 00:41:00,733
I'm sorry to disturb Your Ladyship.

692
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:03,293
Yes, Spratt. What is it?

693
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:07,608
I just hope you will be kind enough
to give me sufficient warning.

694
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:11,743
I'm sorry, what?

695
00:41:11,794 --> 00:41:15,571
So I may find myself alternative
employment, before I am cast out.

696
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,324
Oh, Spratt...

697
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:21,629
You have clearly had a bad dream
and are confusing it with reality.

698
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,220
Your Ladyship's humour is always a tonic,

699
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,851
but it is a matter of
some importance to me.

700
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,319
If you were talking in Urdu, I
couldn't understand you less.

701
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,272
Miss Denker has broken the news

702
00:41:32,321 --> 00:41:36,458
that the households, here and
at the Abbey, are to be reduced.

703
00:41:36,507 --> 00:41:38,689
- Has she?
- I do not see how you could manage

704
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,879
without a cook, a
housemaid or Miss Denker,

705
00:41:41,928 --> 00:41:44,829
which leaves me as the
only candidate for removal.

706
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:48,456
Well, I believe many people live
without butlers. So I'm told.

707
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:53,319
Exactly. And all I ask is some
warning when my time is up.

708
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:56,349
Well, leave this to me,
Spratt. I will attend to it.

709
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,390
Your Ladyship.

710
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,502
So, can I go to the auction tomorrow?

711
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:12,969
Well, why does Mr Mason want to go,
himself? Won't it make him sad?

712
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:16,359
I think he's quite nostalgic.
He's known the family all his life.

713
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:19,348
- But it's bound to be upsetting.
- Which is why I want to help.

714
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:22,456
- Oh, I see that.
- And the new owners will be there.

715
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:25,208
Of course they will. They'll
want to buy a lot of stuff,

716
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:27,281
to make it convincing when they take over.

717
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:30,111
We'll be back in time for tea,
so I can do my work for dinner.

718
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,382
- But how will you get there?
- I've asked Mr Stark

719
00:42:32,433 --> 00:42:34,735
if I can ride in the
front of one of the cars.

720
00:42:34,783 --> 00:42:37,764
Well, you've got a nerve!
Mr Carson won't like that.

721
00:42:37,813 --> 00:42:40,832
Even Mr Carson can't
always have it his own way.

722
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:44,499
- Ooh... - Lady Mary's out, miss, and
I don't know when she'll be back.

723
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,532
Who shall I say has called?

724
00:42:46,582 --> 00:42:48,844
- I'll wait.
- Er...

725
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:51,556
Lady Mary could be hours, so
there's no point in waiting.

726
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:53,708
- I will, all the same.
- Thank you, Mr Molesley.

727
00:42:53,757 --> 00:42:55,860
I'll deal with this.

728
00:42:55,911 --> 00:42:59,010
I have no desire to be rude, miss,
but if you wish to see Lady Mary,

729
00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:00,922
I suggest you make an appointment.

730
00:43:00,973 --> 00:43:02,557
What's going on? Carson?

731
00:43:02,606 --> 00:43:07,022
Nothing to concern you, my Lord.
This young lady is leaving.

732
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:09,373
On the contrary -- it will
concern you quite a lot,

733
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:12,214
cos I've waited for Lady Mary long enough.

734
00:43:20,824 --> 00:43:23,215
Oh, my dear, how exotic.

735
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:26,434
I expect to find the whole
of the Bloomsbury Set

736
00:43:26,483 --> 00:43:28,307
curled up in a corner with a book.

737
00:43:28,357 --> 00:43:30,580
Michael knew quite a
few of them, actually.

738
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:33,249
I met Virginia Woolf in this
room, and Lytton Strachey,

739
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,044
although he didn't stay long.

740
00:43:35,093 --> 00:43:36,878
I wish I'd known your Mr Gregson.

741
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:39,508
We smiled at each other and
spoke about the weather,

742
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:42,178
but we never really talked.

743
00:43:42,229 --> 00:43:45,368
Sometimes I feel I've been given
one little bit of happiness,

744
00:43:45,417 --> 00:43:47,401
and that will have to do.

745
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,514
From now on, my life
will be all of a pattern.

746
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:52,512
Nonsense. You have Marigold.

747
00:43:53,191 --> 00:43:55,184
That's true.

748
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,326
So, what do you think I should do?

749
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,874
- Would you like a London life?
- The fact is, I'd like a life.

750
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,867
Well, I won't speak against London,

751
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:07,131
but remember, I had no children
to make a country life sensible.

752
00:44:07,182 --> 00:44:09,803
Whereas I have a child
I can't acknowledge.

753
00:44:09,852 --> 00:44:12,233
People aren't so curious in London.

754
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,427
No. They couldn't care less.

755
00:44:14,475 --> 00:44:16,538
Isn't that a relief?

756
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:20,246
And then there's the museums
and galleries and theatre.

757
00:44:20,295 --> 00:44:22,439
People always talk of such things,

758
00:44:22,488 --> 00:44:26,036
but one only ever goes
when friends come to stay.

759
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:30,251
- When's your train?
- You're right. We should go.

760
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,728
But the question remains.
What is your future?

761
00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:37,027
Hanging around Downton,
being sniped at by Mary?

762
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:41,053
Charity work? Travelling?
Publishing? What?

763
00:44:41,104 --> 00:44:43,833
Well, that's the problem. I don't know.

764
00:44:44,212 --> 00:44:46,205
I just don't know.

765
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:57,118
- I've been watching out for you.
- Why? What is it?

766
00:44:57,166 --> 00:45:00,983
A young woman of most unappealing
aspect has been asking for you.

767
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,256
- Was her name Bevan?
- I knew she was trouble.

768
00:45:03,305 --> 00:45:06,324
She may cause trouble for me, but
only because I've been foolish.

769
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:08,757
Oh, we can all be foolish, My Lady.

770
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,865
You know, Carson, some day
there'll be something I've done

771
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,818
that even you will condemn me for.

772
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:17,168
- I doubt that very much.
- Did she say if she'll be back?

773
00:45:17,216 --> 00:45:19,439
She never left. I tried
to get her to go, but --

774
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:23,176
- Where is she now?
- In the library, with His Lordship.

775
00:45:29,533 --> 00:45:32,752
- Papa, I don't know what this person
has told you... - Only the truth.

776
00:45:32,803 --> 00:45:36,778
.. but I hope you're not giving
her any money. Not on my account.

777
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:41,057
Take it and go. And remember, one word...

778
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,472
Aren't you the lucky one?

779
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:46,984
But then I suppose you always are.

780
00:45:53,371 --> 00:45:55,883
- What did she say?
- Enough.

781
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,001
I find I'm most disappointed
in Tony Gillingham.

782
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,994
Don't be.

783
00:46:07,043 --> 00:46:09,545
He wanted us to get married.

784
00:46:09,595 --> 00:46:13,740
Our week in sin was just part
of his plan to persuade me.

785
00:46:15,574 --> 00:46:17,437
Then why did you say no?

786
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:20,507
Because, when it came
to it, he wasn't right.

787
00:46:20,556 --> 00:46:22,578
At least, not for me.

788
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:25,370
And you didn't think of George?

789
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:28,119
Of course I did. I thought of all of you.

790
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,232
I just needed to be sure.

791
00:46:32,354 --> 00:46:34,616
I suppose you were a widow, after all,

792
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,530
and not a deb in her first season.

793
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,321
But it's still not the way your
parents would have behaved.

794
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:40,955
Oh, I don't know...

795
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:43,785
If you believe what they
write about the Edwardians.

796
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,017
What were you planning
to do with Miss Bevan?

797
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:49,126
I wasn't going to be
blackmailed -- I know that.

798
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:53,193
So I suppose I'd have let
her publish and be damned.

799
00:46:53,241 --> 00:46:55,574
Rather tough on Tony and Mabel.

800
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:00,766
Anyway, I'll telephone
the bank in the morning

801
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:03,117
and return your thousand pounds.

802
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:08,220
I gave her 50 pounds, and here's
her signed confession to blackmail.

803
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:10,173
How did you manage that?

804
00:47:10,222 --> 00:47:13,441
I told her she could either have
50 pounds, on condition of signing,

805
00:47:13,492 --> 00:47:16,920
or leave with nothing and
be reported to the police.

806
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:20,377
But... how do you know she won't be back?

807
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:23,924
I said, if anything were published
or if we ever see her face again,

808
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:26,506
I'd use it and she'd be prosecuted.

809
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:28,947
I'm impressed.

810
00:47:28,998 --> 00:47:33,253
My darling Papa transformed
into Machiavelli at a touch.

811
00:47:33,303 --> 00:47:35,206
Will wonders never cease?

812
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:37,248
Is that a compliment?

813
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:41,822
You're still out of pocket,
50 quid. I must repay it.

814
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:45,251
No need. It was money well spent.

815
00:47:45,301 --> 00:47:47,722
- Why?
- To learn that my eldest child

816
00:47:47,772 --> 00:47:51,867
is a child no more and quite
tough enough to run this estate.

817
00:47:51,918 --> 00:47:54,220
Indeed, she could clearly run the kingdom,

818
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:56,801
should she be called upon to do so.

819
00:47:57,497 --> 00:47:59,641
Well, I hope you mean that.

820
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:01,433
I do.

821
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:05,260
And I'm more interested than
ever to see who, in the future,

822
00:48:05,311 --> 00:48:08,808
does come up to your exacting standards.

823
00:48:08,858 --> 00:48:10,681
Maybe no-one.

824
00:48:10,732 --> 00:48:14,429
I'd rather be alone
than with the wrong man.

825
00:48:14,478 --> 00:48:17,498
Who was that young woman I saw leaving?

826
00:48:17,547 --> 00:48:19,291
Someone after money. Usual thing.

827
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:21,762
- Did you give her any?
- Some.

828
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:24,234
It was quite a good cause.

829
00:48:24,285 --> 00:48:27,982
- Has Edith telephoned?
- Yes. She'll be home for dinner.

830
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,533
I wonder if she wants to
come to Mallerton tomorrow.

831
00:48:30,582 --> 00:48:33,800
Maybe we should all go. The
Fall Of The House Of Usher.

832
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,243
We mustn't crow. We may be next.

833
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,466
Daisy! Get upstairs. You don't
want to keep them waiting.

834
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:52,994
I keep thinking of what you told me.

835
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:56,581
- About what Mr Carson said.
- I should think so. So do I.

836
00:48:56,632 --> 00:48:58,614
I'm sorry I put you through that.

837
00:48:58,665 --> 00:49:01,196
It was difficult, I'll not deny it.

838
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:05,709
You think I should accept
his terms and set the date?

839
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:08,221
Oh, no, no. That's your decision.

840
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:11,937
I can only say he was very
moving when he spoke of you.

841
00:49:12,656 --> 00:49:14,878
He avoided... vulgarity, then?

842
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:17,230
Vulgarity?

843
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:20,698
Mr Carson wouldn't be vulgar if
they put him on a seaside postcard.

844
00:49:20,747 --> 00:49:24,764
I'd like to feel a man could
speak of me like that at my age.

845
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:26,845
I would.

846
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,350
Now, I must get on.

847
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:40,508
We must get going if we're to
look round before it starts.

848
00:49:40,558 --> 00:49:42,302
So, it's farewell to Mallerton.

849
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:45,570
Why? Are you planning to turn
up your nose at the new owners?

850
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,041
No. I just don't think
I'll be in Yorkshire

851
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:50,235
quite so much in the future.

852
00:49:50,283 --> 00:49:52,268
What a funny thing to say.

853
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:54,300
It's time to go forward,

854
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,573
and I'm unmarried, so I must do it alone.

855
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:58,605
That sounds rather severe.

856
00:49:58,654 --> 00:50:01,157
I think it sounds very positive.

857
00:50:01,205 --> 00:50:03,507
Thank you, Baxter.

858
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:06,457
Mr Carson, when you said we'd
know if there was a plan --

859
00:50:06,508 --> 00:50:09,378
Excuse me, while I see them off.

860
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:14,947
Well, he doesn't seem that
bothered, so it can't be that bad.

861
00:50:14,997 --> 00:50:17,101
You and I both know that the worse it is,

862
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,174
the less he'll want to seem bothered.

863
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,764
Besides, they all want
to be rid of me anyway.

864
00:50:21,814 --> 00:50:24,037
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

865
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:26,706
You've seen how they warn
Andy to keep away from me.

866
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,739
We got on very well when he first arrived,

867
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:30,614
but now he hardly dares to talk to me.

868
00:50:30,663 --> 00:50:32,527
I think this is all in your head.

869
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:34,410
No, it's not.

870
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:50,385
Oh, good. You're here.

871
00:50:50,434 --> 00:50:52,257
I just took a chance.

872
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,009
I thought you might be at
the auction with the others.

873
00:50:55,057 --> 00:50:57,041
I don't like auctions,

874
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:59,711
especially when I knew
the house in the old days.

875
00:50:59,762 --> 00:51:03,818
I hate to see people's
things piled up in a heap.

876
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:05,611
Like so much rubbish.

877
00:51:05,661 --> 00:51:08,800
Well, you and I differ when it
comes to the importance of things.

878
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:12,148
Does it ever get cold on
the moral high ground (?)

879
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,780
I wanted to come because I
don't want us to fall out

880
00:51:14,828 --> 00:51:16,732
over the hospital.

881
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,806
I need to be sure that we can disagree,

882
00:51:18,854 --> 00:51:21,635
without there being any
bad feeling between us.

883
00:51:21,685 --> 00:51:24,226
- Well, it depends who wins.
- Surely not!

884
00:51:24,275 --> 00:51:26,897
Which means you are confident of victory.

885
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:28,731
Well, we shall see.

886
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,764
Shall I ring for some tea?

887
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:34,360
It's rather early, but
I think we deserve it.

888
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,374
I remember Mallerton in the 1860s.

889
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:41,407
Dear old Lady Darnley.

890
00:51:41,456 --> 00:51:43,957
Always liked to stuff
the place with royalty.

891
00:51:44,008 --> 00:51:45,990
She was addicted to curtseying!

892
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,943
How we laughed.

893
00:51:47,994 --> 00:51:49,897
It's sad to think about it.

894
00:51:49,947 --> 00:51:53,085
- Ah, Spratt. Could we have some tea?
- Your Ladyship.

895
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:56,633
It seemed a little chilly, m'lady,
so I've brought you a shawl.

896
00:51:56,682 --> 00:51:58,866
- Oh, you are a wonder, Denker.
- Thank you.

897
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:02,852
- I shall miss you.
- M'lady?

898
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:04,924
Oh, I'm sorry. No, forget I said that.

899
00:52:04,974 --> 00:52:07,475
After all, nothing is settled.

900
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:10,066
What's not settled?

901
00:52:10,115 --> 00:52:11,820
I don't understand.

902
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,292
I thought you told Spratt
about the staff being cut

903
00:52:14,342 --> 00:52:16,165
back here and at the Abbey.

904
00:52:16,214 --> 00:52:19,433
Well, I... may have mentioned it.

905
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:22,383
Oh, well. As I said, nothing's decided.

906
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:25,174
But Your Ladyship couldn't
manage without a maid.

907
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:27,566
Mrs Crawley does. Don't you?

908
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:29,916
Indeed I do,

909
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,388
but I don't wish to upset poor Denker.

910
00:52:32,439 --> 00:52:35,776
But Mrs Crawley also manages
without a butler, m'lady.

911
00:52:35,827 --> 00:52:37,690
That is true,

912
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:41,237
but I don't think I could break
with tradition to quite that degree.

913
00:52:41,288 --> 00:52:43,709
Shall we have some tea?

914
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:45,741
Your Ladyship.

915
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:47,785
Miss Denker?

916
00:52:51,092 --> 00:52:53,315
Don't worry, Miss Denker.

917
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:55,955
I've got a copy of The Lady upstairs.

918
00:52:58,507 --> 00:53:01,367
You don't really mean to manage
without a lady's maid, do you?

919
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:04,078
Certainly not!

920
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:07,475
- Then why did you --
- Sometimes it's good to rule by fear.

921
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,042
I can hardly believe it.

922
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:39,115
I used to come here all the time as a boy.

923
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,468
Sic transit gloria mundi.

924
00:53:41,517 --> 00:53:44,706
Will you be as philosophical
when it's our turn?

925
00:54:11,612 --> 00:54:14,353
Crikey. They're selling everything.

926
00:54:14,403 --> 00:54:16,983
This is John's grandmother,
for God's sake.

927
00:54:17,033 --> 00:54:19,095
They must think it's too large.

928
00:54:19,145 --> 00:54:21,129
Too large for London.

929
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:24,038
Dear John. We're so sorry.

930
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:26,071
At least I hope it's what you want.

931
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:28,623
But it isn't. Not at all.

932
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:30,656
You're having quite a clean sweep.

933
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:34,323
We've kept a few portraits to make
a decent show in the London house,

934
00:54:34,373 --> 00:54:36,595
but what's the point of storing the rest?

935
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:39,625
This life is over for
us. It won't come back.

936
00:54:39,673 --> 00:54:42,574
I admire you. Too many people
just hang on and hang on,

937
00:54:42,623 --> 00:54:45,403
instead of facing things
as they really are.

938
00:54:45,454 --> 00:54:48,235
But we did hang on, I'm afraid.
We hung on for far too long.

939
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,108
And now there's nothing left.

940
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:52,150
Learn from us.

941
00:54:53,905 --> 00:54:56,167
Ah, there are the Hendersons.

942
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:03,222
Is there anything you'd like
to buy, or are we just looking?

943
00:55:03,272 --> 00:55:05,733
I wanted to see the house
as much as anything.

944
00:55:05,783 --> 00:55:08,683
I know this hall from
Christmas parties and the like,

945
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,324
but er... I've a mind to poke around.

946
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,662
That were a wedding present
when Sir John got married.

947
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:18,329
A gift from the tenants. I
contributed half a crown to it.

948
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:21,080
Had no beer for a week.
Shame to see it sold.

949
00:55:21,129 --> 00:55:23,113
I don't think it's right.

950
00:55:23,163 --> 00:55:26,421
That was for Best of
Breed at the county fair.

951
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,454
Won by a Holstein milker.

952
00:55:28,503 --> 00:55:32,121
My dad tended the Holsteins
before he took over our farm.

953
00:55:32,171 --> 00:55:35,190
It's as if they were selling
your past along with their own.

954
00:55:35,241 --> 00:55:37,024
That's them.

955
00:55:37,073 --> 00:55:39,654
That's the new owners. Mr
and Mrs Philip Henderson.

956
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:42,047
The ones who won't guarantee
that you can stay on?

957
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:44,796
- Hey, Daisy. There's no need to --
- I'm not having it. - Daisy!

958
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:47,586
- It won't do any good.
- I have to say something!

959
00:55:47,637 --> 00:55:49,421
It's not fair!

960
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:51,463
Who is this person?

961
00:55:52,221 --> 00:55:55,320
She's the daughter-in-law of
one of our tenant farmers.

962
00:55:55,369 --> 00:55:57,872
Excuse me, but are you the new owner?

963
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,343
- I am. - So it's you who
insists on serving notice to men

964
00:56:00,392 --> 00:56:02,456
who've given their whole life to the land?

965
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:05,643
- Daisy! - You boot out families
who've been here for generations.

966
00:56:05,694 --> 00:56:08,633
- What gives you the right to do that?
- Mrs Mason, there's really no --

967
00:56:08,684 --> 00:56:10,428
I don't think you're the man to tell me.

968
00:56:10,477 --> 00:56:13,018
Pull yourself together. What
do you think you're doing?

969
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,852
A man who sells his wedding presents?

970
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:18,598
Do you know what it meant for
a farmer to give half a crown?

971
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:21,070
- Or don't you care?
- Daisy, stop this at once!

972
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,102
I'm sorry, m'lord, but no.

973
00:56:23,153 --> 00:56:25,894
Mr Mason has given his
whole life to this farm,

974
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:28,365
like his father and
grandfather before him,

975
00:56:28,414 --> 00:56:30,398
but where's the gratitude?

976
00:56:30,448 --> 00:56:32,790
Mr Henderson, I'm sure she
doesn't mean to be rude.

977
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:35,499
You can't imagine that if I do
keep on some of the tenants,

978
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,612
her father-in-law would now be among them?

979
00:56:37,662 --> 00:56:40,204
Now, please don't be hasty.
She's upset for old Mason --

980
00:56:40,253 --> 00:56:42,953
I'm sorry, Darnley. I don't
find this sort of thing amusing.

981
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,143
Good day, Mrs Mason. You
have not helped your cause.

982
00:56:46,192 --> 00:56:48,494
- I'm speaking for myself, not --
- Good day, Mrs Mason.

983
00:56:48,545 --> 00:56:51,245
Now, will you excuse me?
The auction's starting.

984
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:53,915
- I'm sure she didn't mean any
- Oh, God. What have I done?

985
00:56:53,966 --> 00:56:55,630
I daresay he'll cool off.

986
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:57,872
I wouldn't put money on it.

987
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:01,678
We should find our chairs.

988
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:11,136
Good afternoon, lords,
ladies and gentlemen.

989
00:57:11,185 --> 00:57:14,364
The first lot consists of
a set of sporting prints

990
00:57:14,414 --> 00:57:17,713
from the mid-19th century. Who
would like to start the bidding?

991
00:57:17,763 --> 00:57:20,184
Two pounds, anyone? Two
pounds to start with.

992
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:22,098
We're selling things we shouldn't have.

993
00:57:22,146 --> 00:57:25,087
But I kept thinking of that poky
little house in Thurloe Square

994
00:57:25,136 --> 00:57:28,117
- and I couldn't see what else to do.
- You might have stored some of it,

995
00:57:28,165 --> 00:57:30,866
in case one of the children
starts up another house one day.

996
00:57:30,917 --> 00:57:32,980
That's a dream. Face it.

997
00:57:34,345 --> 00:57:37,683
In 20 years' time, there won't be
a house of this size still standing

998
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:39,557
that isn't an institution.

999
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:42,635
One pound, seventeen and six. And sold!

1000
00:57:45,258 --> 00:57:46,922
That's it.

1001
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:49,991
They're in the drawing room,
they've got coffee and we're done.

1002
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,785
- How was your day?
- Not very good.

1003
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:55,053
I'm sure it's not as bad as you
say. Mr Henderson will understand.

1004
00:57:55,103 --> 00:57:57,963
No, he won't. I went to help
and I've made things worse.

1005
00:57:58,013 --> 00:58:00,833
- This was in front of His Lordship?
- In front of all of them.

1006
00:58:00,882 --> 00:58:03,265
- Could prove awkward!
- Thank you, Thomas (!)

1007
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:06,334
If they dismiss me, I've got
no-one but myself to blame.

1008
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:09,762
- It won't come to that, Daisy.
- What will happen to Mr Mason now?

1009
00:58:09,811 --> 00:58:12,591
What can he do? Try to find
another farm to take on as tenant,

1010
00:58:12,642 --> 00:58:15,821
- but who'll let him at his age?
- It's a good life, though, isn't it?

1011
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,574
Are you turning into a country boy?

1012
00:58:17,625 --> 00:58:19,409
You'll have to let me show you around.

1013
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,797
Andy can find his own way round.
He looks sharp enough to me.

1014
00:58:22,846 --> 00:58:24,790
No, no. Come in, come in.

1015
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:27,590
They're here, or they were a minute ago.

1016
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,967
Sergeant Willis has something to tell you.

1017
00:58:31,018 --> 00:58:33,558
I'm sorry it's late, but I
thought you'd want to hear.

1018
00:58:33,609 --> 00:58:36,230
- That depends what it is.
- Shall we go somewhere private?

1019
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,259
For God's sake, they've all lived
with this as long as we have.

1020
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,731
They've found a witness
to the meeting in the pub.

1021
00:58:41,779 --> 00:58:44,680
They've tied them together.
Her confession is real.

1022
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,713
This time, it IS over.

1023
00:58:52,143 --> 00:58:54,805
- Oh, I can't believe it!
- I shouldn't have come until now.

1024
00:58:54,855 --> 00:58:56,639
I'm sorry. I should have waited.

1025
00:58:56,687 --> 00:59:00,076
- Never mind that.
- I'll go and tell His Lordship.

1026
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:04,809
You both helped us when all hope was gone,

1027
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,723
and I'll not forget it.

1028
00:59:06,773 --> 00:59:09,832
I find it hard to acknowledge a
debt but we owe a debt to you.

1029
00:59:09,882 --> 00:59:11,864
Justice has triumphed.

1030
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:15,701
I'm not always convinced that
it does, but it has tonight.

1031
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,124
We must go down at once.

1032
00:59:18,172 --> 00:59:20,156
What can we give them to drink?

1033
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:22,189
It depends how far you want to go, m'lord.

1034
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,218
There's some Veuve Cliquot in
a very cool part of the cellar.

1035
00:59:25,269 --> 00:59:27,809
It's not iced, of course, but
it would be good to drink.

1036
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,277
Fetch it. Fetch three, four
bottles! We must mark this moment.

1037
00:59:31,328 --> 00:59:34,506
It's been such a long road. Can
this really be the end of it?

1038
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:37,146
It seems so. And a happy ending!

1039
00:59:42,488 --> 00:59:44,311
Anna!

1040
00:59:44,362 --> 00:59:46,385
I knew this day would come, I really did.

1041
00:59:46,434 --> 00:59:49,214
Everyone, take a glass, quick as you can,

1042
00:59:49,265 --> 00:59:51,338
while I propose a toast.

1043
00:59:52,891 --> 00:59:55,153
British justice! Envy of the world.

1044
00:59:55,204 --> 00:59:57,186
I suppose if it comes
out right in the end.

1045
00:59:57,237 --> 00:59:59,697
We could've done with the
result a little sooner.

1046
00:59:59,748 --> 01:00:01,572
Amen to that, m'lady.

1047
01:00:01,622 --> 01:00:03,763
Andy, Daisy, go and fetch the gramophone.

1048
01:00:03,814 --> 01:00:06,036
We never seem to use it
now Lady Rose has gone.

1049
01:00:06,086 --> 01:00:08,906
Do we know any more about the
woman who did it, Sergeant Willis?

1050
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:11,656
Only that she sent a message
to Mrs Bates, m'lady.

1051
01:00:11,707 --> 01:00:14,846
She says she's sorry for leaving
it so long to take the blame.

1052
01:00:14,894 --> 01:00:17,516
- That's all very well --
- Give her a message from me.

1053
01:00:17,566 --> 01:00:19,548
Say I forgive her. Wish her luck.

1054
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,581
What will they do now?

1055
01:00:21,632 --> 01:00:24,092
She'll serve time for
manslaughter. She won't hang.

1056
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:26,125
So Mr Green goes on ruining lives.

1057
01:00:26,176 --> 01:00:29,673
But not your life. Not any more.

1058
01:00:29,724 --> 01:00:32,104
I'm sorry for what we've
put you through, Mrs Bates.

1059
01:00:32,155 --> 01:00:34,177
I probably shouldn't say it, but I am.

1060
01:00:34,227 --> 01:00:36,849
You did no more than your
duty, Sergeant Willis.

1061
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:39,838
We'll leave you to it.
Good night. Sleep well.

1062
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:42,479
There's more wine if you finish this.

1063
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:46,654
We'll sleep tonight, all right.

1064
01:00:46,703 --> 01:00:49,993
And wake tomorrow without
that rock on our chests.

1065
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,031
I think I might go into
Thirsk in the morning,

1066
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,786
visit some estate agents.

1067
01:00:54,835 --> 01:00:56,499
Start planning again.

1068
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,543
But not for a family.

1069
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:01,164
I'm afraid we can't plan for that.

1070
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:03,197
We're free.

1071
01:01:03,246 --> 01:01:05,439
We're safe, and I have you.

1072
01:01:06,235 --> 01:01:08,219
That's enough, I promise.

1073
01:01:08,268 --> 01:01:10,252
I know you want it to be true,

1074
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:12,285
and I love you for it.

1075
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,357
So much.

1076
01:01:14,408 --> 01:01:16,868
And I love you.

1077
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,830
- What are you doing?
- Is this the refrigerator?

1078
01:01:27,881 --> 01:01:29,863
It is.

1079
01:01:29,914 --> 01:01:33,102
- Mrs Patmore hates it.
- Oh, of course she does.

1080
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,560
Don't eat anything
that's meant for tomorrow.

1081
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:38,393
Now, this takes me back.

1082
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:41,543
Did I ever tell you about our
cook when I was a boy, Mrs Yardley?

1083
01:01:41,592 --> 01:01:43,336
Many times.

1084
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:46,207
She was quite a crosspatch,
but she was always kind to me.

1085
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:49,156
She used to let me hide down
here when I was in trouble.

1086
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,826
She kept a box of biscuits
and sweets just for me.

1087
01:01:51,877 --> 01:01:54,258
- Rosamund was furious.
- Rosamund was jealous.

1088
01:01:54,308 --> 01:01:56,531
Come to bed.

1089
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,802
Sorry, Carson. We shouldn't be here.

1090
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:00,835
Oh, quite all right, m'lady.

1091
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:04,941
But I did want a private word
on the question of Daisy.

1092
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,014
I've heard what happened at the auction.

1093
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:09,325
I don't believe we can
allow it to go unnoticed.

1094
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:12,595
- No, I suppose not.
- It is a dismissible offence.

1095
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:15,584
Oh, isn't that a bit harsh? On
the day of Bates' good news?

1096
01:02:15,634 --> 01:02:17,577
I'm sure she regrets it.

1097
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:20,926
I daresay Guy Fawkes regretted
trying to blow up Parliament,

1098
01:02:20,974 --> 01:02:23,197
m'lady, but he still had to pay the price.

1099
01:02:23,247 --> 01:02:24,991
Can't you just tick her off?

1100
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,503
You'll know how to ensure
there's no repetition.

1101
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:29,974
Very good, m'lady, if
that's what you wish.

1102
01:02:30,023 --> 01:02:32,007
We're going up. Good night.

1103
01:02:32,057 --> 01:02:34,249
Good night, m'lord, m'lady.

1104
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:39,421
Have you thought about where
the Carsons will live?

1105
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,374
- After they're married?
- Not really.

1106
01:02:41,423 --> 01:02:43,407
I'd rather put it out of my mind.

1107
01:02:43,456 --> 01:02:45,440
Will we have to call her Mrs Carson?

1108
01:02:45,489 --> 01:02:47,393
I'm not sure I can.

1109
01:02:47,442 --> 01:02:49,904
We have higher mountains to climb.

1110
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:52,694
Have you come to a decision
about the hospital?

1111
01:02:52,744 --> 01:02:54,728
What sort of a decision?

1112
01:02:54,776 --> 01:02:58,275
I suppose I hope you can support
Mama's efforts to keep control.

1113
01:02:58,324 --> 01:03:01,025
Better yet, stay out of it entirely.

1114
01:03:01,075 --> 01:03:03,935
I can't stay out of it,
Robert. It's too important.

1115
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:06,287
And your mother, incidentally, is wrong.

1116
01:03:06,336 --> 01:03:11,389
All of which adds up to a very
trying spring and summer ahead.

1117
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:26,099
I suppose you thought
there'd be no repercussions,

1118
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:28,132
what with Mr Bates' news.

1119
01:03:28,183 --> 01:03:30,286
No. I knew I hadn't heard the last of it.

1120
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:32,319
I just want to know how bad it'll be.

1121
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:36,064
Bad enough, I hope, to make you
feel small and foolish and immature,

1122
01:03:36,115 --> 01:03:39,453
and unable to control your
feelings in an adult manner.

1123
01:03:39,503 --> 01:03:41,525
I feel all those things already.

1124
01:03:41,576 --> 01:03:44,875
But not bad enough for
you to lose your place.

1125
01:03:44,925 --> 01:03:47,147
If it were up to me,
it might be different.

1126
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:50,655
But Her Ladyship insisted
on a second chance.

1127
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:53,484
- Thank you, Mr Carson.
- Don't thank me, thank her.

1128
01:03:53,534 --> 01:03:56,923
Now, get back to the party
before I change my mind.

1129
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:18,278
Right, well, shall we rejoin the others?

1130
01:04:18,328 --> 01:04:20,321
Before we do...

1131
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:24,745
.. I know I've been putting you off...

1132
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:29,837
.. and Mrs Patmore spoke
of your conversation.

1133
01:04:29,888 --> 01:04:31,870
I knew she would.

1134
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:35,060
I hope we've not shocked you between us.

1135
01:04:35,108 --> 01:04:36,973
No, I'm not shocked.

1136
01:04:37,022 --> 01:04:39,006
I thought it better to be honest.

1137
01:04:39,055 --> 01:04:41,039
Once you'd raised the matter.

1138
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:43,072
I agree. Much better.

1139
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,141
I wouldn't want you to think
that I'd inveigled you

1140
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:49,489
into an arrangement which
was not what you'd expected.

1141
01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:51,602
I would never think that.

1142
01:04:53,644 --> 01:04:55,628
Right.

1143
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:57,859
Well, if you've had second thoughts,

1144
01:04:57,909 --> 01:05:00,689
I think we should let the
staff know in the morning.

1145
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,722
I won't make a big announcement.

1146
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,952
We'll just tell one or two people
and let it come out naturally.

1147
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:09,459
There'll be a bit of a nine
days' wonder, of course,

1148
01:05:09,508 --> 01:05:11,851
but we'll get over it.

1149
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,093
But you misunderstand me.

1150
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:18,627
I was afraid I'd be a
disappointment to you.

1151
01:05:18,677 --> 01:05:22,463
That I couldn't hope to
please you as I am now.

1152
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,653
But if you're sure...

1153
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:31,234
I have never been so sure of anything.

1154
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:33,974
Well, then, Mr Carson...

1155
01:05:34,024 --> 01:05:37,920
If you want me, you can have me.

1156
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:42,155
To quote Oliver Cromwell, warts and all.

9999

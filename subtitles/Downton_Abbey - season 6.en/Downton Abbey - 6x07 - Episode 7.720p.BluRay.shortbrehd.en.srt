1
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,150
Tell me the worst, Billy.

2
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,070
I'm afraid Mr Rogers beat you
by three-and-a-half seconds.

3
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,830
Take it like a man, Henry. Can I
help it if I am your superior?

4
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,150
You want a drink?

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,960
- Why not?
- See you there. Thanks, Billy.

6
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,710
- Well, this is very nice.
- What is?

7
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,670
Mary's beau, Henry
Talbot, has invited us all

8
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,750
to watch him drive at
Brooklands next week.

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,910
- He's just sucking up.
- Mama won't ever let you go.

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,510
- I don't see why not.
- Because you're still convalescing.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,030
I only want to watch the
race, not drive in it.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,950
It's a long way, and it won't
last much more than ten minutes.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,470
He told me he's inviting Bertie Pelham.

14
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,310
- Oh.
- What about you, Mary?

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,040
I think I've talked myself into it,
although I'm sure I'll be sorry.

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,830
Just think! It's finished
and open for business.

17
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,110
You are the owner of a
bed-and-breakfast hotel.

18
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,870
- What have you had done?
- I turned a bedroom into a bathroom

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,350
- and I've installed an inside privy.
- Think of that.

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,310
It leaves me two bedrooms to let,
and one for my niece to run it.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,310
- Which is yours when the time comes.
- Mmm, when the time comes.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,350
All you need now are some clients
and that will happen soon enough.

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,470
- How's life for the newly-weds?
- Fine.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,950
Only, Mr Carson wants to
dine at the cottage again.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,750
No need to sound so gloomy.
I can rustle up something.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,350
Whatever you do rustle up,

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,030
I won't cook it right, or
the plates will be cold,

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,110
- or the dressing will be wrong.
- Does he appreciate all you do?

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,430
- Does any man?
- Ooh, Daisy.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,670
Mr Dawes has been given a
date by the examining board.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,470
- Blimey, when is it?
- The 20th.

32
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,950
Oh, my God!

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,630
I will thank you not to take
the name of the Lord in vain.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,180
I hope it's not in vain! I
need all the help I can get!

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,670
- Do you enjoy weddings?
- Yes. But I'm not going to that one.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,030
I'd feel like the wicked fairy at
the christening of Sleeping Beauty.

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,990
Why would Larry Grey want you to
be there? I mean, you of all people.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,030
I'm sure he doesn't. Dickie
must've persuaded them to ask me.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,630
I doubt that. He wouldn't want
to subject you to more insults.

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,150
Well, who then?

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,350
I'd say this is the
work of Miss Cruikshank.

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
She's the one always
making a show of friendship.

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,390
Why don't I pay a call on her?
See if I can winkle out the truth.

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,870
- I'm sorry I showed it to you now.
- Oh, don't be, don't be.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,790
Are things going well
in my former kingdom?

46
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,710
Cora is settling in. I
know it must feel awkward.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,310
Oh, no. I'm yesterday, she's
tomorrow. That's the way it is.

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,350
- You must be feeling very hurt.
- Well,

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,790
the fact is, I might as well be honest.

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,190
I am angry at the way I have been treated.

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,470
I don't blame you.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,270
While angry, I say things some
people find hard to forgive.

53
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,950
So, I have decided to go away.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,440
I'd rather vent my rage
on the desert air...

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,870
.. and return when I've
regained control of my tongue.

56
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,310
Your self-knowledge is
an example to us all.

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,110
You don't think I'm wrong?

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,590
The last thing you need
at this stage in your life

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,870
is to quarrel with your
son and daughter-in-law.

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,470
Precisely. But don't fear. I'll call
on Miss Cruikshank before I leave.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,470
I suspect she's quite a tough nut.

62
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,560
And I'm quite a tough nutcracker.

63
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,390
How's Mr Mason getting on? I'm
always ready if he needs any help.

64
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,350
I'm going down there this afternoon,
I'll tell him you said so.

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,870
I am trying to find a
position, Mr Carson, honestly.

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,350
I don't say you're not, but it doesn't seem
quite fair on His Lordship to string it out.

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,950
Does that mean I'm sacked?

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,110
It means I shall be pleased
when we learn the identity

69
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,560
of your next employer, Mr Barrow.

70
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,950
We'd stay with Rosamund, drive
to the track, have lunch,

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,270
see some racing and come
home the following day.

72
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,830
It's so unnecessary in your state.

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,750
But I'm not in a state. Unless
it's a state of boredom.

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,390
Please let me.

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,030
- It's not my decision.
- If you mean that, then we're going.

76
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,190
- Edith?
- Oh, I'm in if Bertie's coming.

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,350
It's a long way for him.

78
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,870
Maybe there's something
else for him to do in London.

79
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,270
Isn't it enough that
it's a chance to see you?

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,590
Would it annoy you if it were?

81
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,750
I'm sorry if Mr Carson
spoke harshly just now.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,230
He doesn't mean to be unkind.

83
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,390
But it worries him when a plan is delayed.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,640
The plan being my departure.

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,040
You just haven't found the
right person yet, Mr Barrow.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,350
But I'm sure there are friends
out there waiting for you,

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,870
and a new job in a new house
may help you to find them.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,120
Well, you see, Mrs Hughes,...

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,000
.. this is the first place I've found
where I've laid down some roots.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,710
I'm terribly sorry, Lady Grantham.
No-one told me you were coming

91
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,390
- and I'm afraid Lord Merton's out.
- It's you I've come to see.

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,110
How flattering.

93
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,960
- May I offer you anything?
- Only your attention.

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,940
Shall I sit here?

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,310
Now, Mrs Crawley tells me
that you paid her a visit

96
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,910
when you first came, that
you were amazingly friendly.

97
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,590
- Well, I hope I'm always friendly.
- Nobody's always friendly.

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,830
And now you have invited
her to your wedding,

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,950
which has taken her by surprise.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,990
You mean Larry and Mrs Crawley have
not seen eye to eye in the past.

101
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,670
Larry Grey has spoken to
Mrs Crawley in a manner

102
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,070
that in any other century would
have resulted in him being

103
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,590
called out and shot.

104
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,550
I can't believe it was as bad as that.

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,630
Then you are misinformed.
But I want to know this.

106
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,150
Why encourage Mrs Crawley when your
fiance detests the mere idea of her?

107
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,710
I still dispute that, but I would say

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,710
that Larry had perhaps not
quite thought matters through.

109
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,390
- Meaning?
- Only that his father is old,

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,350
and alone, and in need of...

111
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,070
In need of care?

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,350
Which you are not prepared to give.

113
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,350
I would've said a companion.

114
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,800
Which you are not prepared to be.

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,230
And what of this house? Will you
surrender it to be free of him?

116
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,750
She won't want to live at
Cavenham after Lord Merton's death.

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,430
It would be lonely for a woman like her.

118
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,550
But, by heaven, I bet it won't be
too lonely for a woman like you.

119
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,390
I expect they'll have to drag you
out as you break your fingernails

120
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,580
catching at the door case.

121
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,630
So, there we have it.

122
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,560
You want a free nurse to take her
tiresome old man off your hands.

123
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,310
You're a cruel, little Miss, aren't you?

124
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,710
I'd feel sorry for Larry, if
I didn't dislike him so much.

125
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,270
I shall forget you said
that, but you should go now.

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,870
Much more, and we may
feel awkward when we meet.

127
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,620
- Which we are bound to do.
- I think not, Miss Cruikshank.

128
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,280
Not if I see you first.

129
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,030
Er, as you may have gathered,

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,470
the family will be away
for three days next week,

131
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,270
so if any of you feel
you're owed some time off,

132
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,670
perhaps you could take it then.
Er, but clear it with me first.

133
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,670
I've put in the advertisement.
It'll be out in the morning.

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,150
- So, now you just have to be patient.
- What's this?

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,910
Mrs Patmore is ready for her first
visitors to the guest house.

136
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,350
- That was quick.
- Yeah, just what I said.

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,950
- I've got butterflies.
- Oh, don't be silly.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,550
I'll go over to check it
all when they're in London.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,630
Oh, I'll come with you if you like.

140
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,230
Everyone has something to do
on their free days, except me.

141
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,830
We know what you've got to do, Mr Barrow.

142
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,840
Yes, Mr Carson.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Well! If that doesn't
just take the biscuit.

144
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,630
Are you going to tell me or not?

145
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,390
She's only decided to up sticks and
set sail for the South of France.

146
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,030
- When? - The family
are in London next week

147
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,470
for the racing, so she wants
to leave while they're away.

148
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,070
- She can't do that!
- No?

149
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,190
Well, perhaps you'll pop up and tell her.

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,670
- Save me packing.
- What happens to you?

151
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,040
What do you think? I go with her.

152
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,470
I don't know -- strolling
along the Croisette,

153
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,510
dining in Juan-les-Pins.

154
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,270
- It's a burden I can bear.
- And what about me?

155
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,110
You stay here, sticking in stamps.

156
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,670
And so, she's going to sneak off
while they're away from home?

157
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,190
My Lady doesn't sneak,
thank you very much.

158
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,840
If there's any sneaking to
be done, I'll leave it to you.

159
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,800
Must go. So much to do.

160
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,350
It's a nuisance, but I can't help it.

161
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,120
Two dinners, neither very grand,...

162
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
- .. and clothes for Brooklands.
- Very good, My Lady.

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,350
I'm sorry if you're not keen. I am.

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,750
I just worry about getting
Mr Talbot's hopes up.

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,470
Well, I'm curious about the fellow.

166
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,630
Listen, I like him a lot, but I
don't believe a professional driver

167
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,350
with very little to look
forward to will make her happy.

168
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,790
Sybil, maybe. But not Mary.

169
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, that's the whole point.
What's he got that fascinates Mary

170
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,030
when poor old Tony's rolling acres
and glistening coronet didn't.

171
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,270
You'll say sex-appeal, but
isn't Mary too sensible?

172
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,720
We have a very contrary daughter.

173
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,400
Anyway, I've never been motor racing.

174
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,950
Mr Talbot will fix it. You
can help with the picnic,

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,190
but you'll have to take the train.
There won't be any room in the cars.

176
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,870
Mr Bates is looking forward to it.

177
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,470
- I wish I was.
- You don't have to go, you know.

178
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,190
I think I do. It's part of
him, and I must get used to it.

179
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,630
That sounds serious.

180
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,390
I suppose you don't approve.

181
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,800
- It's not for me to say, m'lady.
- But do you approve?

182
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,800
Mr Talbot seems a nice gentleman.

183
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,440
I'm just not sure his life
and your life fit together.

184
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,310
- I don't mean to offend you, m'lady.
- I'm not offended.

185
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I'm troubled because I
understand what you mean.

186
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,190
- They do say that opposites attract.
- Yes, they attract.

187
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,780
But do they live happily ever after?

188
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,070
I think I'll go up in a minute.

189
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,030
How do you revise if he's
testing your general knowledge?

190
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,310
Surely, you'll either
know it or you won't.

191
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,510
- I just feel I have to do something.
- Is it so important to you?

192
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,390
It's important I don't feel a fool.

193
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,310
- You're not a fool. I'm the fool.
- Why do you say that?

194
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,230
Because I still can't decide
what to do about Coyle.

195
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,240
I don't know why not.

196
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,350
Maybe if I'd given evidence in
court, but that never happened

197
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,870
and as Her Ladyship said,
"The story feels unfinished."

198
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,470
You sound as if you're going.

199
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,710
I need to be sure he has
no power over me any more.

200
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,160
Will you tell me when you decide?

201
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,310
When Daisy said you'd like to help,

202
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,960
I wondered if you could bring
the books up to date a bit.

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,150
Or tackle some of the heavy stuff?

204
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,390
Oh, there's nothing I can't do
until we separate the piglets.

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,190
But I've got to get on top of
the figures. When can you come?

206
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm busy just now, as it happens.

207
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh, well. Let me know
when you can get away.

208
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,950
You're leaving now? Today?

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,990
I'll spend tonight in London,

210
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,070
then I'll sail on the SS Paris
from Southampton tomorrow.

211
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,550
We'll cruise around the Mediterranean,

212
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,350
then I'm staying with
the Broughams in Cannes.

213
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,750
- They keep asking me.
- Surrounded by foreigners.

214
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,550
My reason for travelling is to
make myself eager to come home.

215
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,230
A month among the French should manage it.

216
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,670
- Won't Robert be hurt?
- Oh.

217
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,350
Not as hurt as he would be
if he knew why I was going.

218
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,870
Now, can you give this
to him when they get home?

219
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,550
What if they want to contact
you while you're away?

220
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,080
Well, I've... I've written to Tom.

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
Told him how to reach me.
He's the most sensible.

222
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,390
Oh, by the way,

223
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
I called on Miss Cruikshank.

224
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,110
And was she behind that odd invitation?

225
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,390
The fact is, she wants you
to take Dickie off her hands

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,270
and out of her hair.

227
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,190
I'd say your choice is
harder now than before.

228
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,190
You know, when we talked, you
didn't want to come between

229
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,790
- a father and his sons.
- Well, what's changed?

230
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,150
Well, now you must decide

231
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,750
whether to abandon him to his
selfish and greedy children.

232
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,870
I mean, is that kind or right?

233
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,670
It's still a tug-of-war I
have no wish to be part of.

234
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,790
Well, my guess is, when you
take delivery from Miss Amelia

235
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,000
you'll be lucky if you
see a Christmas card.

236
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,080
- Can you be ready by tomorrow night?
- Oh, it's just one couple.

237
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,110
Well, the house has been
beautifully finished.

238
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,190
No doubt about that.

239
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,870
But there is a lot to think about.
You don't offer dinner, do you?

240
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,910
No, if they need dinner,
they can go to the pub.

241
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,110
But I would like to make
a thing of my breakfasts.

242
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,190
- I want a reputation for them.
- You'll manage that easily enough.

243
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,590
I'm here again tomorrow,

244
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,110
but should I come back
on Thursday morning?

245
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,750
The family will still be in London,

246
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,390
and Daisy could easily do the
servants' hall breakfast.

247
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,270
I have no objection.

248
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,150
Now, dinner with Mr Carson. Why not
tomorrow night when they're away?

249
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,910
I suppose we could eat at
a normal time, for once.

250
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Ah, well, you could and you couldn't,...

251
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,760
.. because I've had an idea.

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,870
- Oh, hello, stranger.
- I'm not really here.

253
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,590
I'm racing at Brooklands tomorrow,
and I thought I'd pop in

254
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,830
- and see what's new.
- Not much.

255
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,710
Oh, although, we have had an offer today.

256
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,950
I was going to ask you what you thought.

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,230
Er, her name is Miss Cassandra Jones.

258
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,710
She thinks we ought to
have an advice column.

259
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,230
- With her dispensing it?
- Yes, but I must say

260
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,350
her samples are quite funny.

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,230
"Your husband is losing interest?

262
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,750
Well, here's step one.
Take a look in the mirror."

263
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,630
What are you proposing?

264
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,350
We'll invent some problems,
she can write the answers,

265
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,110
then see how the public likes it.

266
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,070
There's nothing new in an
agony column, of course,

267
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,110
but they're very popular in America,

268
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,270
which means they're due a revival here.

269
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,630
Should we interview her?

270
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,110
No, let's leave it until
we decide to go forward.

271
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,230
I think it's worth a try.

272
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,910
I've never seen motor racing close up.

273
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,390
My sister's new boyfriend
drives. Why not come?

274
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,550
- I'm not sure I should.
- Well, I'm your employer,

275
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,950
so if I think it's all
right then it must be.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,030
You can meet my family,
if you're strong enough.

277
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,550
Looking round the table,

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,910
I wonder if we ought to have opened
Grantham House. I feel rather guilty.

279
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,070
Oh, don't. I know what a palaver it is.

280
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,230
More so, now there's no real staff.

281
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,870
Almost everyone we know is
selling their London house.

282
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,990
But I suppose that's not for me to say.

283
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,990
I went past the site of
Devonshire House on my way home.

284
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,270
There's something vast
going up in its place.

285
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,710
Flats and offices and salerooms.

286
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,910
People don't want vast palaces any
more, even if they can afford them.

287
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,750
They were fun, though.

288
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,790
In my youth, all the great hostesses

289
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,310
used to have luncheon
laid for 20 every day.

290
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,550
And if you turned up in time, you
just sat down to a lovely feed.

291
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,710
I'm so sorry, Lady Rosamund, I
thought dinner would be finished.

292
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,360
And so it should be. We'll go through.

293
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,230
Unless the boys prefer to
stay and talk racing cars.

294
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,680
- I think I'd rather join the
ladies. - Like Lord Byron? - Hmm.

295
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,470
Well done for rounding them
all up. I'm very grateful.

296
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,920
Don't be. I'm as keen as you are.

297
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,950
It's a bit obvious. Dropping
in uninvited after dinner.

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,470
I hope it is obvious. Obvious that
I want to be a part of this family.

299
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,750
Don't I have a say in the matter?

300
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,310
I want to surround you with people
murmuring, "Isn't he divine?"

301
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,150
Or "You'd be mad to let him go."

302
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,950
Suppose they say, "I shouldn't
have thought a racing driver

303
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,590
was your sort of thing at all"?

304
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,510
They don't have to,
you've already said it.

305
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,270
I'm afraid there's a list as
long as your arm of people

306
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,110
- who are coming tomorrow.
- Hmm.

307
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,590
Just give me the list
and I'll sort it out.

308
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,510
Did you mind my inviting your
family without telling you?

309
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm here, aren't I?

310
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,900
Let's get some coffee.

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,710
Are you prepared for your exams?

312
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,950
- I've done as much as I'm able.
- No-one can say more.

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,630
I confess, I wasn't always sure about it,

314
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,630
but now you've got there, well done.
I wish you every good fortune.

315
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,470
I wonder where she'll go from here.

316
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,390
Doesn't Gwen's visit show us that

317
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,350
in the new century anything is possible?

318
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,750
And what about you, Mr
Molesley, are you ready?

319
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,990
I think so, hmm. Ready as I'll ever be.

320
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,150
I'll walk down with some lunch
for you and Daisy and Mr Dawes.

321
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,190
- Oh, you don't have to.
- No, I'd like to.

322
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,390
I'll give you a hand.

323
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,310
Mr Barrow, what are you doing
with your free time tomorrow?

324
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,040
Scanning the jobs column,
Mrs Hughes, what else?

325
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,550
There, that's got it.

326
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,270
I think you're all set.

327
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,710
- It's a good car.
- Clearly, we need you on the team.

328
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,800
Don't tempt me, Henry.

329
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,670
- Who's this?
- Laura Edmunds, my editor.

330
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,110
Laura, this is Tom
Branson, my brother-in-law,

331
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,670
and the man of the hour, Mr Henry Talbot.

332
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,470
- Hello.
- My sister, Mary.

333
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,550
These are my parents. You can
sort them out in your own time.

334
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,190
- Nice to meet you at last.
- Lord Grantham, Lady Grantham.

335
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,830
This is Charlie Rogers.
He drives on Henry's team.

336
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,310
Henry's team, is it? When I beat
him into a cocked hat every time.

337
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,470
Oh, he's just showing off. I'm
faster, I'm younger and better.

338
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,990
But not at driving.

339
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,710
I wish there was something
more I could do to be useful.

340
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,950
- Oh, just cheer, Tom.
- I don't have to be asked.

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,630
I don't know why I'm doing
this. I can't even swallow.

342
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,310
It's all terribly swank, not
a bit what we're used to.

343
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,430
- No? - Normally, it's an oil-stained
sandwich and a bottle of pop.

344
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,190
Well, I'm glad to think
we've brought an improvement.

345
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,630
Thank you.

346
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,990
My train sat in a tunnel for an hour.

347
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,910
Anyway, I'm here now.

348
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,390
Come and meet Miss Edmunds.

349
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,670
Is it hard to be a woman editor?
Fleet Street sounds so very tough.

350
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,590
It's hard to be a woman
anything if it isn't domestic.

351
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,870
- But I do my best.
- I think it's courageous and good.

352
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,590
Heavens! Papa's conversion to the
modern world is almost complete.

353
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,750
Don't be deceived. He'd still like
to see us happy wives and mothers.

354
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,670
That's not fair. Even leopards
can change some of their spots.

355
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,260
Quite. Now, there's still some food.

356
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,590
I'm glad no-one seems unhappy
that Lady Edith hired a woman.

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,470
You're a big improvement on the
last editor, that's for sure.

358
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,030
And you're not the only one around
here who's broken a few barriers.

359
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,380
I started my life at Downton
Abbey as the chauffeur.

360
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,990
I think we're being summoned.

361
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,590
- The cars are in place. We should go.
- Right behind you.

362
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,110
You'll stay there if I have my way.

363
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,390
I can't begin to tell you what it
means to me that you came today.

364
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,750
I hope so, because my digestive
system has packed up completely.

365
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,110
I'm going to be fine. Mary, you
must credit me with SOME skill.

366
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,750
Now, when I pass you, I expect
to see you cheer and wave.

367
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,270
Does praying count?

368
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
- Henry!
- Coming.

369
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
Well, that should keep my spirits up.

370
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,110
I'll see you in a minute.

371
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,480
'We're just waiting for the last chap...'

372
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,280
'And here he comes. It's Henry
Talbot, driving car No.14.'

373
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
Good luck, Charlie.

374
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,870
Good luck, old boy.

375
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,830
'Now, any moment,

376
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,820
the flag will fall and
the race will begin.'

377
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,030
'Just listen to the roar of those
engines, ladies and gentlemen.'

378
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,470
And they're off. There they
go, tearing down the street

379
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,120
and jostling for first position.

380
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,160
Come on, Charlie!

381
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,110
Here they come!

382
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,430
Come on, Talbot!

383
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,550
I don't think you can shout that.
Isn't Talbot the name of a car?

384
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,470
I can't shout "Come on, Henry."
They might all be called Henry.

385
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,190
- Oh, my God, here they are.
- Come on!

386
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,360
- When will it be over?
- Not soon, they go round and round.

387
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,190
Yes! Come on!

388
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,580
Come on! God bless you! Come on!

389
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,070
What's the point? What
do they get out of it?

390
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,440
What do you think? Speed.

391
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,310
This is kind of you, Mrs Patmore.

392
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,350
I meant to bring some lemonade, but
I left it on the kitchen table.

393
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,790
I could kick meself.

394
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,510
Is this what you mean?

395
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Oh, that was kind of you,
Mr Barrow. Thank you.

396
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,270
How were the exams? Did you do well?

397
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,630
We can't know the answer
to that, can we, Mr Dawes?

398
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,430
You'll find out soon enough.

399
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,110
But Daisy will have to wait a while.

400
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,150
I've not finished yet. I've got
three more papers after lunch.

401
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,390
- Was it harder than you thought?
- See for yourself.

402
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,310
What about number two? It knocked
me for a loop, I can tell you.

403
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,560
What does it say? Read it out, Andy.

404
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,880
- I'll read it.
- Why, what's the matter?

405
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,620
"Tsar...

406
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,220
"Nic... holas..."

407
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
Here, give it here.

408
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,270
"Tsar Nicholas I called Turkey
'the sick man of Europe'.

409
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,270
What were the causes of Turkey's illness

410
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,880
and what measure was the Russian
Tsar prescribing for its recovery?"

411
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,670
I can't read, Mr Molesley.

412
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,310
At least Mr Barrow's been
trying to teach me to read,

413
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,350
- but I'm too stupid to learn.
- Don't say that.

414
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,600
So, there we have it. I'm
a fool who knows nothing.

415
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,740
I am nothing.

416
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,270
'The race is going to hot up now

417
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,230
because the lead car,
car No.6, has withdrawn

418
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,230
with what looks like
radiator trouble. Oh, dear.

419
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,280
It looks like Sir Patrick
has blown a gasket too!'

420
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,870
Here they come again.

421
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,990
- My God, but don't you envy them?
- No, I don't.

422
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,240
Nor me. We're going to
have to keep an eye on Tom.

423
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,600
There is something gallant and
daring in it, even I can see that.

424
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,110
Andy, maybe I can help,
if you'd like me to.

425
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,950
Oh, that's very kind.
What do you say, Andy?

426
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,350
Well, I've tried and tried with Mr
Barrow, and I can't break through.

427
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,470
- I'm too stupid.
- Will you stop saying that?

428
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,830
You're not stupid, and I promise you I
can soon have you reading for pleasure.

429
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,190
If you'll just come two or three
times a week after school closes.

430
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,630
- Could you manage that?
- That's the best time for me.

431
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,230
It won't take long, you'll see.

432
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,110
- We can go on with...
- Mr Barrow,

433
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,070
it might be better if you step back now.

434
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,790
You've been very generous, but we wouldn't
want to confuse Andy with different methods.

435
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,150
No, of course not.

436
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,310
I hate to cut this short, but Daisy's
still got a lot of work to do

437
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,710
- and she better get started.
- Need any help?

438
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,910
- I can manage.
- Well, good luck, Daisy.

439
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,630
Yes, good luck.

440
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,030
Funny when the house is
empty above decks and below.

441
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,510
All the more reason for us to be vigilant.

442
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,710
- Let's sit down.
- Erm, I don't know.

443
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,000
Oh, just for a moment.

444
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,430
- Hmm.
- There.

445
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,420
That's nice, isn't it?

446
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,750
They don't live badly,
you have to concede.

447
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,350
They live as they're supposed
to live. It has its burdens

448
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,630
and its benefits.

449
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,990
Better than a life of just burden.

450
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,950
I hope you're ready for tonight.

451
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,110
For once, we can eat when civilised
people eat, so don't be late back.

452
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,430
Are you sure you know how to cook it?

453
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,080
Don't you worry. I've been through
every detail with Mrs Patmore.

454
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,550
Hello.

455
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,270
What have we here?

456
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,520
- Can anyone join in?
- No, Mr Barrow, they cannot.

457
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,910
'It's shaping up to be a tight
battle for the winner's laurels.

458
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,190
What's this? The No.8
Bentley is slowing down!

459
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,150
It's pulled in at the side of the track.

460
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,630
Looks like steering trouble.
And there goes Rogers!

461
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,510
Rogers has taken the lead and now look!

462
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,910
Henry Talbot in car No.14 tries
to snatch the lead away from him.

463
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,390
Here he comes again!

464
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,510
Talbot attacking from the inside
and challenging for the lead.

465
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,860
I don't think Rogers has
the power to fight him off!

466
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,150
Oh, dear, look! Rogers
is coming back at him!

467
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,750
Would you believe it? He's
going to take back the lead!

468
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,870
What a stunning piece of
driving by Charles Rogers!'

469
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,830
And here they come again,
it's the two Bentleys

470
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,360
neck and neck past the
grandstand. Come on, Bentley boys!

471
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,440
Come on!

472
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,910
Chin up. Won't be long now.

473
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,670
Really? It feels as if we're
trapped in some witch's curse

474
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,670
for all eternity.

475
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,670
'This is terrible. This is awful!'

476
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,720
- Stay here. Bertie, come with me.
- Of course.

477
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,060
No, it's no good. I can't stay.

478
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,180
You're not going anywhere.

479
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,150
- I must go to her!
- No, no, Anna. Not in your condition.

480
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,630
- Never mind, I have to go.
- Can you follow her, please?

481
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,080
Of course.

482
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,670
Get him out of there!

483
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,080
Charlie!

484
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,990
- Turn around!
- Charlie!

485
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,550
It's too late. Henry, Henry, get back!

486
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,470
Henry, Henry, get back!

487
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,950
- Charlie!
- He's gone, Henry.

488
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
No! Charlie!

489
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,760
Charlie!

490
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,990
We have to help him. Charlie!

491
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,670
- Charlie!
- Let me pass.

492
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,390
I know him. Let me pass!

493
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,310
You can't say that. We
don't know it's him.

494
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,110
- Oh, my God.
- I need help here!

495
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,080
Who is it? Can we find out who
it is? Tom, Bertie, who is it?

496
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm afraid it's Charlie Rogers.

497
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,440
He was my friend.

498
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,590
My best friend, really.

499
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,340
If that phrase didn't sound
like it was something from a...

500
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
.. Rider Haggard novel.

501
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,430
I keep asking myself
if I... encouraged him.

502
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,310
Of course you encouraged him,

503
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,670
- and he encouraged you.
- Yes, but I'm so stupid, I...

504
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,230
I...

505
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,310
I needled him and I
teased him, I pushed him.

506
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,230
And he did the same.

507
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,710
And if you'd have died instead of him,

508
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,270
he'd be here asking exactly
the same questions.

509
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,720
Yes, but I didn't die and he did!

510
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

511
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,470
We're going now.

512
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,550
Aunt Rosamund doesn't want
to cancel dinner tonight.

513
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,200
She thinks we should all be
together on a day like today.

514
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,680
I can't. I have to deal
with Charlie's family.

515
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,920
Of course. I wasn't thinking.

516
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,720
Tell her thank you.

517
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,110
- And, Mary...
- No.

518
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,640
Let's not do any of that stuff now.

519
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Go on, then. Put us out of our
misery. Did he pass or not?

520
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,230
Mr Molesley, I'd be very glad

521
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,030
if you would join the teaching
staff at the village school.

522
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,750
Well, I'll be...

523
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,550
Very good of you to come
up tonight to tell me.

524
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,070
Does that mean you'll be a
teacher and not a servant?

525
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,230
- When will you be leaving?
- Give him a moment.

526
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,710
There's a lot to be settled.

527
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,070
- Course there is.
- I'm impressed, Mr Molesley.

528
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,400
There are Oxford and Cambridge
graduates who know far less than you.

529
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,550
You should be proud.

530
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
Good night.

531
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,160
Mr Dawes.

532
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,870
Thank you very much.

533
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Well done, Mr Molesley.

534
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,830
- It'll be you next.
- I doubt it, but thanks.

535
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,190
We should celebrate. Come into the
kitchen while I get the dinner going.

536
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,940
There's a bottle of wine there,
if Mr Carson wouldn't mind.

537
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,190
Is that the end of service for you?

538
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,390
Hmm, service is ending
for most of us, Daisy.

539
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,510
I've just got a head start.

540
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,590
Will you miss it?

541
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,190
Oh, let's face it. I were
never going to make butler.

542
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,310
Well, not in a proper house like this one.

543
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,630
And from now on, there's going
to be more and more people

544
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,110
chasing fewer and fewer
jobs, so it's probably time.

545
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,270
And this seemed like a good way to go.

546
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,870
Well, I'm glad. You deserve it.

547
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,790
I never think I deserve anything.

548
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,310
Perhaps I've been wrong all along.

549
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,590
Are you coming, Mr Barrow?

550
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,960
In a minute. You go ahead.

551
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,710
Here you are, Daisy, you have one.

552
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,520
- Andy, come on. Have a glass of wine.
- Congratulations.

553
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,570
But how did you do it?

554
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:25,250
Er, I must have stumbled and
fallen over in the wrong way.

555
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,930
Mrs Patmore put on a bandage, but I'll go to
the doctor in the morning if it's no better.

556
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,060
- But how are you going to cook?
- I can't cook!

557
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,850
I can't lift.

558
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,930
But it's not difficult. I'll
talk you through it, don't worry.

559
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,850
You mean... I'm going to cook?!

560
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,570
It's very straightforward.

561
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,890
Now, get the chicken
in the oven right away,

562
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,410
then peel the potatoes and
prepare the cauliflower.

563
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,530
Oh, and put a kettle on to boil.

564
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,450
You should find bread and an
onion for the bread sauce.

565
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,440
Butter and milk are in
the meat safe outside.

566
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,420
I assume that none of us are
going to eat anything else.

567
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,450
One talks of risk and danger,
and it sounds like fun.

568
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:17,260
But of course, the reality
behind it is sudden death.

569
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,530
Sudden, stupid, wasteful death.

570
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:25,820
It was a bloody awful business.
A bloody, bloody awful business.

571
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,500
- The English language never
lets you down. - Oh, shut up!

572
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,570
Shall we go through?

573
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,170
- You're going to bed.
- Me, too.

574
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,330
The rest of you can talk
into the small hours.

575
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,890
Should I say goodbye?

576
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
Not yet. Come into the
drawing room for a drink.

577
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,130
Henry's on the telephone.

578
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,650
Tell him to ring tomorrow.

579
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,040
I think you should speak to him.

580
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,050
'You should try to sleep.'

581
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,940
I found that I had to
hear your voice first.

582
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,060
The truth is...

583
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,450
.. I won't sleep until I
know where we're headed.

584
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,570
Henry, please let's not do this now.

585
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,580
- Think of Charlie, not us.
- Hear me out. Charlie would have.

586
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,730
Because his death has made me realise

587
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,050
we don't have a minute
to waste, you and I.

588
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,170
This is my carpe diem moment. I...

589
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,700
- I must seize the day.
- No.

590
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,570
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, I wouldn't have said this now,

591
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,900
but today has made me
realise something, too.

592
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,220
We're not meant to be together, Henry.

593
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,210
- We're not right.
- I can...

594
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,410
Don't start saying you'll give up racing.

595
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,850
I don't want you to give up anything

596
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,130
- except me.
- I can't give you up.

597
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,370
Please. I wish you nothing but good.

598
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:16,160
I want you to have a long and happy life.

599
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,530
- Just not with me.
- Mary, please don't do this.

600
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,860
I must.

601
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,140
Good night, Henry.

602
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,650
I wish you wouldn't.

603
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,290
Do you know the worst thing?
When they said it was Charlie

604
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,570
and not Henry who was dead, I was glad!

605
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,090
Think of that. I was glad!

606
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,650
You're not seeing straight.

607
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,530
Today brought up Matthew's
death and all the rest of it.

608
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,450
- You're in a black mist.
- It's not what I want!

609
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,100
You're frightened of being hurt again.

610
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,610
But let me tell you this.

611
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,330
You will be hurt again, and so will I,

612
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,180
because being hurt is part of being alive.

613
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,640
But that is no reason to give up
on the man who is right for you.

614
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,010
I'm sorry I'm a bit behind.

615
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,210
The potatoes may have caught.

616
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,890
Never mind. Er, how's the cauliflower?

617
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,280
Oh, God.

618
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,050
Oh, while you're there,

619
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,570
put in the apple crumble. Bottom oven.

620
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,700
Mmm.

621
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,850
I think it's been a good day.

622
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,090
The funny thing is, I quite
enjoyed it in the end.

623
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,490
I'm glad it's turned out
well for Mr Molesley.

624
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,930
And Andy. I think that'll
turn out well an' all.

625
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,130
I suppose so. Even if he only wants to read
to learn more about farming from Mr Mason.

626
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,330
And if he does? You must share, Daisy.

627
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,330
Love isn't finite. If Mr
Mason makes new friends,

628
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,650
it doesn't mean he has
any less love for you.

629
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,170
Doesn't it?

630
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,130
I never had much that
was my own, you know.

631
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,380
Well, you found the love of a father
there and you can count on him.

632
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,530
Just as you can count on me.

633
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,120
Now, run along and I'll finish this.

634
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,530
Mmm. This crumble's good.

635
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,660
My mother's was always a bit soggy.

636
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,010
Hmm, crumble. Oh!

637
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,500
Is that it now? Are we done?

638
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,170
Oh, just put the things in to soak.

639
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,250
Make sure you cover the pots with water.

640
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,610
You don't have to do the washing up
till tomorrow if you don't want to.

641
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,690
- You won't be better by the morning?
- Oh, not for that.

642
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,610
We could ask Billy to come over,
but he's got his own work to do.

643
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,970
You don't mind, do you?

644
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,740
No, I don't mind.

645
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,900
I expect you're glad to
get to bed. I know I am.

646
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,970
- What is it?
- I just wondered if I was right.

647
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,090
That you're to be congratulated.

648
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,610
It's a bit early to
shout about it, but yes.

649
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,810
I'm happy for you. It's good
to think of a new life coming,

650
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,130
especially on a day like this.

651
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,200
Well, good night.

652
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,010
Look at you, stretched out like a pasha.

653
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,090
A creature of leisure.

654
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,810
Early night for me. He went to
bed when he left the dining room.

655
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,010
Not for me. She's very shaken.

656
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,770
- By the crash?
- Because of the crash,

657
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,290
and she's broken up with Mr Talbot.

658
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,290
I wouldn't have thought it was the right
night to make that sort of decision.

659
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,290
She says she's sure.

660
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,010
- Do you think she's right?
- I don't know.

661
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,610
Probably.

662
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,220
Then there's no more to be said.

663
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,210
I'm afraid I've got to go.

664
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,330
You've been such a help.

665
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,370
It's odd, isn't it? We
witnessed a tragedy today

666
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,050
but, sitting here with your arm around me,

667
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,930
I can't remember feeling so comfortable.

668
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,370
When you say things like
that, you make me so happy.

669
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,210
If it isn't wrong to feel
happy on a day like this.

670
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,410
I don't believe it's ever wrong
to feel happy and confident

671
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,730
in someone else's company.

672
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,930
Do I really make you feel those things?

673
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,250
It's not a trap.

674
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,650
Today has been sad and wretched,

675
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,490
and having you here has
helped me face it, that's all.

676
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,340
The thing is, I'd like
to be trapped, and...

677
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,490
Well, I better just say it.

678
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,370
I want to marry you.

679
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,930
- Oh!
- You're not offended?

680
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,610
Offended? Why would I be offended?

681
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,090
I'm thrilled, I'm delighted.

682
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,650
- I'm just rather surprised.
- Why? You know I'm mad about you.

683
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,010
I don't ever think I'm the
sort of girl men are mad about.

684
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,690
Then you're wrong, because I am.

685
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,610
I... I know I've not got much to offer

686
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,530
and your father's probably hoping for

687
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,250
more than a penniless land agent,

688
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,050
but if love is allowed
to weigh in the balance,

689
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,100
I've got plenty of that.

690
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,180
I must ask you something.

691
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,130
Would you let me bring Marigold with me?

692
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,610
Marigold?

693
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,050
Your family's ward?

694
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,410
You see, I'm much fonder
of her than anyone else,

695
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,860
and I'd hate to leave her behind.

696
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,530
If she means that much to you.

697
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,770
Of course, I hope we'll
have children of our own

698
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,770
- before close of play.
- Oh, absolutely. I'd like that, too.

699
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,620
- Does that mean you accept?
- Not quite.

700
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,850
I'll have to think about it. I'm
sorry to be a killjoy, but I must.

701
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:58,090
Be my guest. I'm not going
to marry anyone else.

702
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,140
Not until after you've
broken my heart, anyway.

703
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,720
I'll go.

704
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,570
Kiss me first.

705
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,020
And I promise I won't
keep you waiting too long.

706
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,850
All right, let's see
what you make of that.

707
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:40,210
Now, I must be off, but my
niece, Lucy, is in the kitchen.

708
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,660
- She'll see to everything.
- Thank you. - Thank you.

709
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,250
Hello, Carson.

710
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,410
Mrs Crawley is in the library, My Lord.

711
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,010
She's been here for some time.

712
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,890
- Why?
- She didn't say, My Lady,

713
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,770
but she seems eager to see you all.

714
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,290
Also, er, Mr Spratt rang to ask
when you'd be arriving from London.

715
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,890
- Mr Spratt?
- The Dowager Countess' butler.

716
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,970
Oh, that Mr Spratt. What did he want?

717
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,620
- Again, no explanation was proffered.
- Curiouser and curiouser.

718
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,570
Isobel, I hope we haven't
kept you waiting for hours.

719
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,250
Not at all, it's entirely my
fault. I got here far too early.

720
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,810
- How was it?
- Perfectly terrible, as it happens,

721
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:28,530
but let's not go into that now.

722
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,850
Oh, I am sorry. And, to be quite honest,

723
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,770
- I feel rather awkward.
- Why, what is it?

724
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,370
I have a letter from Cousin Violet.

725
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,610
Why didn't she bring it herself?

726
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,010
- Because she's gone away.
- Gone away? Where?

727
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,650
She's on board the Paris,
headed for the Mediterranean.

728
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,730
This is me, isn't it? I've
done it. She's furious with me.

729
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,170
I don't see the point of
bringing any of that up now.

730
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,490
- What does it say in the letter?
- Nothing much.

731
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,650
She needs a change of air,

732
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,930
and Spratt is bringing a
present by way of goodbye.

733
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,610
That's why he rang.

734
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,570
Mr Spratt has arrived, My Lord.

735
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,850
- Oh, show him in.
- Well, that is,

736
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,490
he's in the servants' hall

737
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,770
with a present for Your Lordship and
he doesn't want to bring it up here.

738
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,730
- What is going on?
- He may be right, My Lord.

739
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,730
- Let's go and see what it is.
- If you wish,

740
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,120
but it all seems very rum to me.

741
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,530
What is it? What's the surprise?

742
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,610
You'll soon see, m'lord,
but I think it's a good one.

743
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,250
- Good day, m'lord.
- Spratt, what is

744
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,290
this great secret you're about to reveal?

745
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,580
Her Ladyship chose her herself,
m'lord. Er, she was most particular.

746
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,810
Oh! Hello, little one!

747
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,340
Oh!

748
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,890
Now, what are we going to call you, eh?

749
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,210
Oh, I know, Tiaa.

750
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,890
I thought we always had
names from ancient Egypt.

751
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,250
Tiaa was a wife of Amenhotep II
and the mother of Thutmose IV.

752
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,530
Don't you know anything?

753
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,450
She's not exactly trained yet, m'lord.

754
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,050
so we decided against
bringing her up to the library.

755
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,130
Oh, I don't care about that.
You're coming upstairs with me.

756
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,130
Tom, what about this, eh?

757
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,290
He does love his dogs.

758
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,250
How were your guests this morning?
Was everything satisfactory?

759
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,890
Oh, very. He was a doctor,
Mrs Hughes. Imagine that!

760
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,770
So, I don't think I could
have started better.

761
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,170
Even if I did work harder
over their breakfast

762
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,730
than anything I've done
since Lady Rose got married.

763
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,530
Oh, talking of which,

764
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,170
has Mr Carson survived his
ordeal from last night?

765
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,650
Put it this way --

766
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,250
he has discovered a new respect for
the role of cook and bottle washer.

767
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,210
So I think he'll be giving
less trouble in the future.

768
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,500
What's so funny?

769
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,460
Just life, Mr Carson.

770
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,940
Just life.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

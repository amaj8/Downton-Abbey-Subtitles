1
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,030
I think we're all here. I'm
looking forward to this.

2
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,870
You should be at this board meeting.
You're a trustee and the patron.

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,190
- Why are they coming here?
- I don't know exactly.

4
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,670
I suppose they have something
they want to tell us.

5
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,110
They obviously need more money.

6
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,120
Right, we're off. See you later.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,310
Who's that? It's not one of
the farmers' wives, is it?

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,030
No, I don't think so.

9
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,950
Do you really like riding like that?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,150
When a side-saddle is
so much more graceful.

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,630
And so much more dangerous.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,310
Is Mama right? You're dodging
the hospital meeting?

13
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,040
Only a little bit.

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,950
- May I be of assistance?
- No, thank you.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,030
Well, I expect you'll want to get started.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,350
- Started at what?
- Following the hunt.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,030
If you go with the others, they'll show
you where to watch them jump the brook.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,480
I see. Ta very much.

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,950
- Can I lick the bowl?
- Yes.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,110
You can both lick the bowl.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,030
- I enjoyed that.
- Was it your first meet?

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,150
There's not much hunting in Bayswater.

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,990
Andy, go back and check
that everything's come down.

24
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,740
- I think it has, Mrs Hughes.
- It never hurts to check.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,950
- He's a nice boy.
- He is.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,590
And I think I'm showing him
the right way to do things.

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,350
I should let him find
his own way, Mr Barrow.

28
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,310
Can I have a piggy-back?

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,880
All right, then, but not for long.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,830
- I want to go hunting, too.
- All aboard.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,550
- And off we go!
- Faster! Faster!

32
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,310
- Everything running smoothly?
- Oh, I suppose so.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,590
But it's harder with no
kitchen maid, you know.

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,830
- Have you settled on a date yet?
- Date?

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,150
Oh, you mean for the wedding?

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
No, not yet.

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,150
Oh, what are you doing up here?

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,070
The button came off my cuff.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
I thought I'd mend it
before things got busy.

40
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,270
- Shall we go down?
- Before we do...

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,790
.. I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.

42
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,040
Whatever makes you say that?

43
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,150
- You'll say I'm being stupid.
- Well, maybe you are.

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Maybe.

45
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,310
You see, when I accepted Mr Carson...

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,870
- You didn't mean it?
- Oh, yes, I did.

47
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,510
He's a very, very dear man.

48
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,910
So, what's the problem?

49
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,710
I hadn't fully considered...

50
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,590
all the aspects of marriage.

51
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,670
Of what I was getting into.

52
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,190
I don't understand. What aspects?

53
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,560
You know each other better
than most couples at the start.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,520
Oh, my Lord. You mean...?

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,630
Yes.

56
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,510
That is precisely what I mean.

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,190
Well, there's nothing so
terrible about it, is there?

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,950
So they say. I wouldn't know, of course.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,870
Mrs Patmore, look at me. I'm
a woman in late middle age...

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,710
Oh, don't say 'late'.

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,350
I was not bad-looking as a
girl, if you can believe it.

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,590
- Very easily.
- But these days?

63
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm not sure I can let
him see me as I am now.

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,110
Perhaps you can keep the lights off.

65
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,870
That is not helpful, Mrs Patmore.

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,510
Well, won't he feel the same?

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,950
I mean, no-one's clapped eyes on
him without his togs for years.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,350
- Except the doctor.
- Good point. Very good point.

69
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,270
Maybe he'd prefer us to leave
that side of things alone.

70
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,270
Sorry? Live like brother
and sister, you mean?

71
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,670
A very loving brother and sister.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,880
- And that's what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

73
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,910
Except not to feel embarrassed and absurd.

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,150
Is this why you've not fixed the date?

75
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,390
I think we should be clear
about what we're doing.

76
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,800
- Or not doing.
- Yes. Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

77
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,160
The trouble is, I don't believe it's
a conversation I can have with him...

78
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,670
Oh, you're not suggesting I try?

79
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,910
Oh, would you?

80
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,880
Oh, by 'eck!

81
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,510
I've had some commissions
in my time, but...

82
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,230
It would be such a weight off my mind.

83
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,790
Anna? Whatever's happened?

84
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,430
Nothing. I'm starting a cold.

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I'd better get on.

86
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Are you all right?

87
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,230
Of course. No bones broken, anyway.

88
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,910
Thanks to nice Mr Fairclough here.

89
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,350
Very kind of you, Fairclough.
Good to see you out.

90
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,310
I never like to miss a day's
hunt when it's on my doorstep.

91
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,030
- Shall I take you back to the
house, m'lady? - Certainly not.

92
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,550
If you can just give me a hand up.

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,470
I'm not taking any sort of 'tone'.

94
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,600
I'm just reminding you of the deadline.

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,480
Thank you. Goodbye.

96
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,070
Trouble at the mill?

97
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,430
My editor, Mr Skinner, again.

98
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,110
- What's the problem?
- Everything's a problem.

99
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,030
No, that's not quite true.
I think the problem is me.

100
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,950
He doesn't like working for
a woman. Simple as that.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,430
I suppose you're right, not
selling up and taking the money.

102
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,430
I think I am.

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,310
Andrew, please ask Mrs
Hughes to organise tea for...

104
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,390
- I'm not sure. Can you count them
as they arrive? - Very good, m'lady.

105
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,990
- When did you learn about this?
- What do you mean?

106
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,790
Well, you seem to have all the facts,

107
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,910
when it's the first
time we've heard of it.

108
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,830
What does that matter?

109
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,510
The fact is that the Royal
Yorkshire County Hospital

110
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,830
wants to take over our little hospital,

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,230
which is outrageous.

112
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,470
- But it's not as simple as that.
- Why not?

113
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,910
Because there may be
benefits for the village.

114
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,150
If we form such a partnership,
our patients would have access

115
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,150
to more modern equipment,
to more advanced treatments.

116
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,190
Our fundraising would be more efficient.

117
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,150
And the price of the fundraising
would be to lose all control,

118
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,270
and to become the tools of a
faceless committee in York.

119
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,630
What matters more? Health or power?

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,470
What matters is to have power over
the maintenance of our own health.

121
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,670
- Ladies, ladies, please...
- Lady Grantham is right.

122
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,630
Our independence is not
something we should just abandon

123
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,230
without a second thought.

124
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,670
- How did you find out about this?
- They wrote to me.

125
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,670
Who did? I'm the hospital
Almoner. Nobody's written to me.

126
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,230
Ever since you took that position,
you talk as if you run the place.

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,870
I do run the place!

128
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,830
Or, at least, I know every
detail of how it's run.

129
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,550
And I ought to be told
about any proposed changes.

130
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,830
- You're being told now.
- If you must know, it was a friend,

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,950
on the board in York,
who whispered it to me.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,790
They'll write to all of us soon.

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,950
So, you want to protect your power
at the expense of the patients.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,470
I want to protect the patients
at the expense of my power.

135
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,960
And may the best man win.

136
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,580
I'm glad we agree on this.

137
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't let's make too much of it.

138
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm fine.

139
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Good afternoon.

140
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,070
I'm going in.

141
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,350
I'm completely whacked.

142
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Don't tell your mother.

143
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,670
Can you make sure he gets a
proper rub-down? He did well.

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,720
Yes, m'lady.

145
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,670
- Who are you?
- Rita Bevan.

146
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,990
Don't you know me, Lady
Mary? Cos I know you.

147
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,480
No. I do not know you.

148
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,790
And I suppose you have forgotten

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,870
the Grand Hotel in Liverpool, too, m'lady?

150
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,230
And your nights there
with Viscount Gillingham?

151
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,520
I was a chambermaid. But I suppose
we're invisible to people like you.

152
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,670
This is all nonsense. You've no proof.

153
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,510
Don't be silly. You
don't know what I've got.

154
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,870
To start with, I've got
a page from the register.

155
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,270
- Then you are a thief.
- Yes, I am a thief,

156
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,550
and I want a thousand pounds
to keep my mouth shut.

157
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,990
That's ridiculous.

158
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,510
We'll see how ridiculous it is.

159
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm going now, but I'll be back.

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,470
Don't bother. You're not the first
person who's tried to blackmail me.

161
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,760
Well, I'm glad you know how it
works. And as I say, I will be back.

162
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,690
- Penny for your thoughts.
- They're not worth as much.

163
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,690
- They would be to me.
- Oh, I'm worn out. Give me some tea.

164
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,690
You let those children run you ragged.

165
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,650
Thank you. I've had Miss Marigold
on my back since luncheon.

166
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,610
- How lucky is that child?
- Why do you say that?

167
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,410
Well, what was she? A farmer's daughter.

168
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,370
Until she caught the eye of Lady Edith.

169
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,010
Now she'll grow up in the
bosom of a great family

170
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,810
and live her life accordingly.

171
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,760
I don't believe she has any
greater guarantee of happiness.

172
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,980
That's Lady Mary, back from the hunt.

173
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,610
I know you don't approve, but
it's quite ordinary in London now.

174
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,660
- Will that be all, my Lord?
- Yes, thank you.

175
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,010
At least... there is something.

176
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,010
This is part of a larger conversation,

177
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,050
but at some point we need to discuss

178
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,530
future staffing requirements at Downton.

179
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,650
We have cut down quite a bit, my Lord.

180
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,210
We've only got one hall
boy and two housemaids,

181
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,930
and as kitchen staff have
left, we've not replaced them.

182
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,330
I know, and there's no
need for anything drastic.

183
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,210
The estate's doing well, thanks
to Mr Crawley and Mr Branson,

184
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,170
but I don't like to feel out
of step with my fellow man.

185
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,010
As a matter of fact,

186
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,530
both the housemaids have
handed in their notice.

187
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,610
I was going to tell you.

188
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,810
- Oh. Were they unhappy? I hope not.
- No, no, no.

189
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,490
One is leaving to get married,
which we knew was coming,

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,450
and Madge has found a job in a shop.

191
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,810
Which is better than working here?

192
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,050
She says that her young man wants
her to be free in the evenings.

193
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,970
I must ask you to remember, my Lord,

194
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,010
that there were six footmen when I
first came here and five housemaids.

195
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,130
Now we've got to two of each
and no kitchen maids at all.

196
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,010
We must run this place
as it should be run.

197
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,930
I'm not asking you to wield a scythe,

198
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,700
but, I mean, who has an
under-butler these days?

199
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,580
If I could stop history in
its tracks, maybe I would.

200
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,850
- But I can't, Carson. Nor you, nor I
can hold back time. - Unfortunately.

201
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,730
The Dowager Countess has arrived, my Lord.

202
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
Hmm.

203
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,970
- She definitely waited on you?
- Well, she knows I was there

204
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,570
with Lord Gillingham.

205
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,330
- Are you going to pay her?
- A thousand pounds? Don't be mad.

206
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,490
If I pay her, she'll only come back.

207
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,730
- What will you do, then?
- Nothing, until I have to.

208
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,730
Why should a paper print it, anyway?

209
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,490
'Earl's daughter in love
tryst with married viscount'?

210
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,730
He wasn't married then. Nor was I.

211
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,610
It's still a good story.

212
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,410
Anyway, what about YOUR
story? Is there any more news?

213
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,450
You must still be on bail,
or else you'd have told me.

214
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,890
We both are, in a way. At least,
I'm on bail and he's on tenterhooks,

215
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,810
until they decide if they can
make a case against either of us.

216
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,290
- What does Sergeant Willis say?
- Nothing, and Mr Willis isn't unkind.

217
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,970
He'd have told us if it was over.

218
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,810
- No wonder you're upset.
- Why do you say that?

219
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,650
You just seemed a bit down in
the mouth, when you came in.

220
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:51,210
- Never mind me. Now, what shall
we do about your hair? - Mm.

221
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,130
You'll be very late going down.

222
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,690
I wouldn't have washed it, but I
came off, and it was full of mud.

223
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,210
You'll just have to do your best.

224
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,970
- You're very quiet.
- I've got a lot on my mind.

225
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,130
A problem shared is a problem halved.

226
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,010
Huh! Or doubled.

227
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,930
Ah, there you are.

228
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,050
They're down, Mrs Patmore -- I'll
announce it when you're ready.

229
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,490
No, I'm ready now. The first course
is cold, so it's already up there.

230
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,530
- Very good. - Oh, could I have a
word? When you're done for the night.

231
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,530
- May I know what about?
- I'll tell you then.

232
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,060
It's nothing bad. At least...

233
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,020
No, I'll tell you then.

234
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,860
Hm.

235
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,450
I don't think Mr Molesley meant
to be unkind about Miss Marigold.

236
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,250
I'm sure he didn't.

237
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,410
Only, it seemed to put
you in a strange mood.

238
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,290
Did it?

239
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,210
It's ironic.

240
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,210
So many children in need of a home,

241
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,860
and so many homes in need of a child.

242
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,730
My God, what have I said?

243
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,170
My darling, what have I said?

244
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,100
It's not your fault.

245
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,340
Only... I thought I was pregnant.

246
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,010
And then, this morning...

247
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,500
Well, anyway, now I'm not.

248
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,330
You should have told me.

249
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,920
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

250
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,130
You weren't to know that would happen.

251
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,180
But, you see, I was.

252
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,780
Because it's happened before. Twice.

253
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,540
I can't do it. I'm not able.

254
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,480
There is no proof of that.

255
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,970
But if you're not, you're not.

256
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,020
We'll be all right.

257
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
I've let you down.

258
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,240
There are no words less true than those.

259
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,220
You could never let me down.

260
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,970
Besides, we've had so many troubles.

261
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,850
There isn't a couple in the world

262
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,570
who've had as many worries as we have.

263
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,730
So, what did Tom have to say?

264
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,850
He's found a flat with a garden
and Sybbie's happy at her school.

265
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,090
- Speaking in an American accent.
- Would that be so awful?

266
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,570
Poor Tom. If he was a fish out of
water here, what is he in Boston?

267
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,450
A fish back in water, I'd have thought.

268
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,650
There's a tremendous
Irish community there.

269
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,410
If you ask me, he's landed on his feet.

270
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,930
How is the search going
for his replacement?

271
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,650
We've hardly started, really.

272
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,450
We haven't started at all.
We don't need a replacement.

273
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,490
- Why not?
- Because I'm his replacement.

274
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,050
- I'm going to be the new agent.
- You're what?

275
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,410
We've worked together since he came
back from Dublin. Why shouldn't I?

276
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,570
- Quite right.
- Yes, but what about the heavy lifting?

277
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,810
Granny, I think I can lift quite
as much as sad old Mr Jarvis,

278
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,490
before Matthew chased him away.

279
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,250
Brains count for more than muscles.

280
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,090
Long live women's rights and all that,

281
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,810
but it's not a good idea to
take on a job that wears you out.

282
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,810
- I'm doing it now, aren't I?
- Yes.

283
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,170
But you'll be dead by the
year's end at this rate.

284
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,770
I suppose we only know what we're
capable of when we test our limits.

285
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,170
And we certainly know
what you're capable of.

286
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,010
What is that supposed to mean?

287
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,970
Isobel, what's Granny done wrong?

288
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,970
We're to have a fight about the hospital,

289
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,250
and she began it by concealing the facts.

290
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,930
- Oh, dear. - It seems to me we should --
- Cora, don't waste your time on it.

291
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,330
It's a matter between
me and Cousin Isobel.

292
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,730
We can't have the President in a
tug-of-war against the Almoner.

293
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,530
We can if it's needed.

294
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,120
With poor old Clarkson as the rope.

295
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,170
Is now a good time?

296
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,220
As good as any. Sit.

297
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,210
- Some of this?
- No, thank you.

298
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,210
Erm... well...

299
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,050
The thing is, I've been speaking
to Mrs Hughes about your marriage.

300
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,330
- Oh, yes?
- And I was wondering about...

301
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,170
At least, we were both
discussing the terms

302
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,610
on which you intend to live.

303
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,050
Good terms, I hope...

304
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,530
- Are you sure?
- Go on, then.

305
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,330
You see, we were talking
of how it will be,

306
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,050
sharing your life after
so many years on your own.

307
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,660
That's the nub of it -- I agree.

308
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,330
Because you've got used to
doing things in a certain way.

309
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,890
It's true. I have.

310
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,490
But I like to think that
I'm not too old to change.

311
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,890
No, of course not.

312
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,620
But do you expect to... to share your...

313
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,370
- .. way of life?
- Doesn't everyone when they marry?

314
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,290
I suppose.

315
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,100
So, what can I do for you?

316
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,530
Nothing.

317
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,450
Oh... oh, it was very
nice, having a little chat.

318
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,700
And thank you for the port.

319
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,810
But I'll leave you to it now.

320
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Hmm.

321
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,170
Are you plotting something?

322
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,690
You sound like a governess
in fear of dismissal.

323
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,890
You sound like a guilty party, who's
trying to throw me off the scent.

324
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,770
Is something on your mind, Robert?
You seem a bit troubled lately.

325
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,140
Do I? Well, maybe I am.

326
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,770
To be honest, I'm starting to ask myself

327
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,730
how much longer we can go on with it all.

328
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,730
- Well, go on with what?
- The household. The servants.

329
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,970
- You're not in
difficulties, are you? - No.

330
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,570
But a butler, under-butler,
footmen, a valet, ladies' maids...

331
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,930
to say nothing of the housemaids,
the kitchen, the laundry, the --

332
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,010
Yes, well, you...

333
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,170
you think it's a bit too much in 1925?

334
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,570
The wage bill is three times
what it was before the war.

335
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,930
Soon it will be worse. And anyway,
who lives as we used to, now?

336
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,610
Well, I don't think you'll
see much change at the Palace.

337
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,290
The Royal Family, then, the dukes,
some others, and good luck to them.

338
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,690
But most people are cutting down.

339
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,210
It seems hard that men and women
should lose their livelihoods

340
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,130
because it's gone out of fashion.

341
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,130
But what if they could find work?

342
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,300
Well, how many do you see going?

343
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,180
I don't know, but some.

344
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Granny was on form.

345
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,570
I ought to go up to London soon.

346
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,130
- Is this your editor?
- Partly him.

347
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,970
I must get him back on track.

348
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,850
But my tenant's also moving
out at the end of the month.

349
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,580
- Out of Michael Gregson's flat?
- Out of MY flat.

350
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,170
But, anyway, I'm not
quite sure what to do.

351
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,250
Should I smarten it up
and let it out again?

352
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,490
Or would it be good for me
to have my own London base?

353
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,540
It's a thought.

354
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,490
Anyway, I'm off to bed. Good night.

355
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Good night.

356
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,490
Edith alone on the town.
What will she get up to?

357
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,540
At her age, she's entitled
to get up to something.

358
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,960
- What's the matter?
- Why do you ask?

359
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,130
I... just worry about you.

360
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,210
I'm your father. It's allowed.

361
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,200
What makes you think
anything's the matter?

362
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,490
How was dinner? Did you enjoy it?

363
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,090
Quite. I'm afraid the times are
catching up with the Abbey, too,

364
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,490
as they were bound to, I suppose.

365
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,090
How do you mean, m'lady?

366
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,740
Well, the way they run things there.

367
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,880
They're not going to lay off staff?

368
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,530
- Don't say anything.
- Oh, I'm a veritable tomb

369
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,330
where other people's secrets
are concerned, m'lady.

370
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,930
- It won't affect us.
- I hope not.

371
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,810
Oh, no.

372
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,610
We're down to the bare bones, as it is.

373
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,250
You're right. Things are
positively frugal around here.

374
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,130
I do worry about those who'll have to go.

375
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,930
But remember, no talking.

376
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
M'lady.

377
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,670
- How did you get on last night?
- Oh...

378
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,710
Er... Daisy, fetch that coconut ice.

379
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,100
I'd like Mrs Hughes to try it.

380
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,190
Not very well. I couldn't
seem to get to the subject.

381
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,150
- Was he putting you off?
- No, I wouldn't say that.

382
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,350
But it was a difficult topic to arrive at.

383
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,990
Erm... excuse me. I hope you can help me.

384
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,230
I've got a message for
Lady Mary from the Dowager.

385
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,910
She said it's urgent.

386
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,350
If you give it to me, I'll
get someone to take it.

387
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,590
Lady Grantham said I was to
put it into Lady Mary's hand.

388
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,390
I'm sorry, Miss, but we don't know
you, and Lady Mary isn't down yet.

389
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,310
I'm Ellen Gorse. I've just
started at the Dower House.

390
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,870
I've only got to give her an envelope.

391
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,520
Very well. I'll take you to her room.

392
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Yes?

393
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,710
Sorry to bother you,
m'lady, but the Dowager

394
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,390
has sent a message for you.
Apparently, it's urgent.

395
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,790
- I doubt it.
- I haven't got it, m'lady.

396
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,470
She sent a maid to put it into your hand.

397
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,470
How mysterious. Well,
where is this Mercury maid?

398
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Here, m'lady.

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,390
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

400
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,670
We mustn't delay you.

401
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,750
Can you send Anna up?

402
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Of course, m'lady.

403
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,580
- How dare you?
- I dare more than you dare.

404
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,910
You could have asked her to
throw me out. Why didn't you?

405
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,360
It would only make things worse.

406
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,830
It'll be a lot worse when you're
sprawled over the centre pages

407
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,990
of the News Of The World.

408
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,040
You're revolting.

409
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,590
Can't you see that none of
that stuff works with me?

410
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,230
- What stuff?
- La-di-da, gracious great lady.

411
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,830
You think you're so marvellous, don't you?

412
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,630
Your lot's finished. You're
going down and we're coming up.

413
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,430
The working classes may be coming up,

414
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,190
but I'd be very surprised if you are.

415
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,110
Now, please get out.

416
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,830
- Can I have the money?
- No.

417
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,270
You'd only come back for more.

418
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,030
Suppose I gave you my word?

419
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,590
If I wasn't so disgusted,
that would make me laugh.

420
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,310
- I was just on my way up --
- This is Miss Bevan, whom I told you about.

421
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,480
- How did you get in here?
- How do you think? I lied.

422
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,910
Now, you've got one more chance,
and that'll be your last.

423
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,270
You must be a glutton for punishment.

424
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,790
Now, Anna, can you make sure she leaves?

425
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Certainly, m'lady.

426
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,270
Mr Molesley's been on
at me about my exams.

427
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,430
Ooh, I don't envy you. I still
cheer myself up by thinking,

428
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,870
at least I don't have
to take any more exams.

429
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,030
But he's right. I must take
them, or what's it all been for?

430
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,030
Ooh, it doesn't look as if she'll
be staying on at the Dower House.

431
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,950
No. I wouldn't have said she
was a long-term prospect.

432
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,630
Not very congenial.

433
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,420
'Ey, I wonder what was in that message.

434
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,750
I suppose you're surprised to see
me lining up with the Dowager.

435
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,470
Only because I think you're wrong.

436
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,150
Well, you have a touching
faith in officialdom.

437
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,870
Once they take over the hospital,

438
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,190
they will lay down the law, with no
regard for the needs of this area.

439
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,640
I've seen it in war and in
peace -- it's always the same.

440
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,230
Do you not care?

441
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,030
I'll tell you what I care
about. It's not complicated.

442
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,390
I care about survival rates.

443
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,310
Mrs Crawley, I'm sure you
don't intend to be offensive...

444
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,670
No, but I intend to be
truthful. I'm the Almoner.

445
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,910
I know the facts about
this place as well as you.

446
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,550
So, this isn't something Lord
Merton has persuaded you into?

447
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,750
- Lord Merton?
- You remember him, surely?

448
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,740
That famous fount of
all medical knowledge.

449
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,160
Well, I wish you luck
with your fellow warrior.

450
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,830
What is it they say? Rather you than me.

451
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,910
Good day.

452
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,190
You've got a visitor. Sergeant Willis.

453
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,830
- What does he want?
- Search me. He's in Mr Carson's room.

454
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,020
Mr Bates is there already.

455
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,430
But surely, if a woman's
confessed, that's the end of it?

456
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,270
Not quite. Inspector Vyner thinks
it may be a false confession.

457
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,190
You do get people coming forward
who had nothing to do with it.

458
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,030
But haven't they checked her story?

459
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,950
If she's one of his victims,
people must have seen her with him.

460
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,350
That's the point. They
can't prove a connection.

461
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,150
She says Mr Green picked her up in a
pub, but no-one can corroborate it.

462
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,470
We can't send her to
prison if she's delusional.

463
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,550
- Then why have you come here?
- Because it's your right to know

464
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,230
that someone had confessed.

465
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,510
How did she know Mr Green
would be in Piccadilly?

466
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,470
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
She just saw him standing there.

467
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,150
Did he speak to her,
like the witness said?

468
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,280
He spoke. He belittled
her and he laughed at her.

469
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,270
- And she pushed him.
- I believe she's telling the truth.

470
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,880
And I'm certain it'll come
right. Just keep the faith.

471
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Good day.

472
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,270
How stupid of him. To come here
before there was any proof.

473
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,470
Don't be harsh. He meant well.

474
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,720
Meaning well is not enough.

475
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,510
A letter from Rose, to us all.

476
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,110
- How does she sound?
- Hectic and happy.

477
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,550
New York seems to suit her.

478
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,710
M'lord, William Mason's
father is downstairs.

479
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,430
Oh? What does he want?

480
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,950
It seems the owners of the estate
where he's a tenant are selling up.

481
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,390
- What? - The Darnleys
are selling Mallerton?

482
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,110
I find that very hard to believe.

483
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,910
So did he, my Lord, but now
there's to be an auction

484
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,270
of the contents of the house on the tenth.

485
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,870
You astonish me. But what can I do?

486
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,430
He wonders if you could put in a
word for him to keep his tenancy.

487
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,630
How does he know that's
not what they intend?

488
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,670
- He's had a letter giving notice.
- Oh, it may be a formality.

489
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,630
They have to sell with vacant possession,

490
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,350
but the new owners may keep him on.

491
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,230
He just wonders if you could
find out what his chances are.

492
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,870
- Can't he ask them himself?
- You'd be more likely to get an answer.

493
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,150
I hope it's not an impertinence.

494
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,550
No. He was William's father.
He's Daisy's father-in-law.

495
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,630
He enjoys privileges in this house.

496
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,470
That's what I thought, my Lord.

497
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,190
Well, I don't mind telephoning.
Is Mason in the servants' hall?

498
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,030
Give him a drink, and I'll ring
down if I can make contact.

499
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Very good, my Lord.

500
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,230
- So, what are you going to say?
- I've heard they're selling.

501
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,310
I might know someone who's interested,

502
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,030
but I thought I'd check first.

503
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,230
Very ingenious. You would
have made a good courtier.

504
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,680
I would not. Too much standing.

505
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,350
Ah, Mrs Hughes...

506
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,190
You don't think maybe you
should start calling me Elsie?

507
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,710
Not here. Not while we're working.

508
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,510
- Go on, then.
- I wish we could settle the date.

509
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,700
There's no rush, is there?

510
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,510
- Mr Mason. His Lordship's
ringing them now. - Thank you.

511
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,710
But they can't just tell you to go.

512
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,830
Not when you and your dad have
put in so many years there.

513
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,190
They've given me notice, and I
shall have some compensation,

514
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,990
but in the end, I'm
just a tenant, aren't I?

515
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,990
- That's not how I see it.
- It doesn't matter how you see it.

516
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,230
That's how it is.

517
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,280
Hello!

518
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Ah, hello.

519
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,150
Hello, Miss Denker.
What's your mission today?

520
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,270
Not stirring any trouble up, I hope.

521
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,630
- Me? Now, why would you say that?
- I can't imagine (!)

522
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,070
- No, I've come here to sympathise.
- Sympathise? What with?

523
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,950
News that the household here's
to be reduced. I am sorry.

524
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,350
- What? Where did this come from?
- Oh, she never disappoints.

525
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,990
I suppose that's me gone,
then. Last in, first out.

526
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,350
You don't know that.

527
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,910
I suppose it comes down to who's
useful and who's ornamental.

528
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,790
Wouldn't you agree, Mr Barrow?

529
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,710
If it's all right with you, Miss Denker,

530
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,590
I'd rather talk to the organ-grinder.

531
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,870
Oh, dear. I do hope I
haven't cast a shadow.

532
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,510
What did you think you were
doing? Sprinkling sunshine?

533
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,670
- By the way, when did that new
maid start? - What new maid?

534
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,150
She came here with a
message from Her Ladyship.

535
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,110
I haven't the first idea who that c... --

536
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Oh, that's the library.

537
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,670
Mr Mason, you'd better come up with me.

538
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,550
Andrew, what are you doing down here?

539
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,190
- Mr Molesley thought we might need more milk.
- Well, get it, then.

540
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,080
Mr Carson... did you know anything
about staff being laid off?

541
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,790
It's not a subject for the here and now.

542
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,910
Are you ready, Mr Mason?

543
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,230
- Naturally, Sir John is very upset by it all.
- I should think he is.

544
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,950
Unfortunately, they couldn't sell the
estate without vacant possession.

545
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,230
- So, it's sold now?
- Yes. At least, they think so.

546
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,270
- And I have to go.
- Not necessarily.

547
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,430
That would be the
decision of the new owners.

548
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
I see. Well...

549
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,190
Thank you very much for
putting in a word, m'lord.

550
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,670
If I hear anything more, I'll
make sure Daisy knows it.

551
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Thank you.

552
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,190
Poor man.

553
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,270
To have his whole future hanging
in the balance, at his time of life.

554
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,190
These are days of uncertainty.

555
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,360
- How was John when you spoke to him?
- In a state.

556
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,950
They're throwing in the towel.

557
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,230
He says, once the debts are paid,
there won't be too much left.

558
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,630
Tim's emigrating to Kenya.

559
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,310
Poor Marian. To be separated
from her only son.

560
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,590
She'll hate that.

561
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,430
- I said we'd go to the sale.
- Do you want to?

562
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,110
Well, John's father and my
papa were as thick as thieves.

563
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,870
It might be nice to find
a memento of the old boy.

564
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,470
How was Granny?

565
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,750
- Getting ready for a fight.
- Run to Mummy, Georgie.

566
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Hello, darling.

567
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,950
I wish you'd stay out of it. Not
least because she's bound to win.

568
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,590
Nobody ever stops her.

569
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,640
What you mean is, no-one
has stopped her YET.

570
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,510
- Can I help you, Miss Denker?
- No.

571
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,790
I'm just tidying Her Ladyship's papers.

572
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,070
She'll be down in a minute.

573
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,190
- I'll tell Mrs Potter.
- Oh, how very reassuring.

574
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,670
The butler giving the
cook an early warning.

575
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,920
What are you talking about?

576
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,910
- No. I don't want to worry you.
- Worry me with what?

577
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,910
Oh, well, if you must know,

578
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,150
there's going to be a shortening
of the wages bill around here.

579
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,670
But why burden ourselves?

580
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,230
What can we do? Que sera, sera.

581
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,750
Are you trying to suggest, in
your usual, maladroit fashion,

582
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,790
that our jobs are in peril?

583
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,430
Well, I hate to sound smug, Mr Spratt,

584
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,710
but I would suggest that Her Ladyship

585
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,150
will always need to dress and undress.

586
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,590
Ooh, while a butler is a luxury?
Is that what you're saying?

587
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,150
My advice, Mr Spratt, is
to live for the moment.

588
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,200
We none of us know what
the future will bring.

589
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,630
Ah, I've put your spectacles
over there, m'lady.

590
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,830
Thank you, Denker. Spratt, I'll
have dinner whenever it's ready.

591
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,910
Would you tell Mrs Potter?

592
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,440
I will, m'lady, although you
could have rung for her yourself.

593
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,430
I beg your pardon?

594
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,480
I was just thinking
aloud, m'lady. I'm sorry.

595
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,260
I was... I was thinking aloud.

596
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,070
Have you decided what to do
if that Miss Bevan returns?

597
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,230
Not yet.

598
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,590
If I pay her, I've a blood-sucking vampire

599
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,670
on my back for the rest of my life.

600
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,040
If I refuse, I'm ruined.

601
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
What would you do?

602
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,030
Don't be blackmailed, m'lady.

603
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,280
I know it's easy to say, but don't.

604
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,550
I think I agree. If I'm strong enough.

605
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,990
Either way, my life's up the spout,

606
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,430
and though I hate the idea of scandal,

607
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
somehow the shadow of blackmail is worse.

608
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,590
The cheek of her.

609
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,590
It was all I could do
not to give her a slap.

610
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,740
- Will there be anything else?
- No. Thank you.

611
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,200
We may have our problems, the both
of us, but we'll get through them.

612
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,250
- Could you spare me a minute?
- If you like.

613
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,850
Come along to my pantry.

614
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,770
I have a feeling that we
never quite got to the reason

615
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,610
for your visit last night.

616
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,770
No. That's correct.

617
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,740
Only, I'm asking myself...

618
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,770
Were you a messenger from Mrs Hughes?

619
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,890
You could say that, yes.

620
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,250
You were on a mission for her?

621
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Yes. It's true.

622
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:48,770
Mrs Patmore, did she ask you to
tell me she's changed her mind?

623
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,170
What? No!

624
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,410
Well, not exactly.

625
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,690
I'm waiting.

626
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,690
Well, that is all very fine,

627
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,810
but it's hard for me to
talk about such things.

628
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,200
Now I'm on the edge of my seat.

629
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,880
Oh, it's no good. I
shall have to look away.

630
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,810
You see, she is a very
proud woman, Mr Carson.

631
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,250
I know that, and I respect her for it.

632
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,370
And she would never want to
appear ridiculous in your eyes.

633
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,130
- Nor could she.
- No, but...

634
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:24,050
as your wife, she wonders

635
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
if you would expect...

636
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,260
(.. that she perform her wifely duties.)

637
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,130
Don't wives normally perform their duties?

638
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,180
Good wives, any...

639
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,490
- Oh. - Yes. That's it.
I think we've got there.

640
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,530
I do believe we have.

641
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,210
She needs to know if
that's what you anticipate.

642
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,210
A full marriage.

643
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
As opposed to...?

644
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,650
Living together in
companionship, I suppose.

645
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,500
In friendship. Warm friendship, I'm sure.

646
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,010
Is that what she's
offering? Warm friendship?

647
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,140
She has to know what you expect.

648
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,730
Ever think of a time when we're told
the whole Mr Green business is over?

649
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,540
- Of course I do. - We could start
to plan again, revive our dreams.

650
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,980
You mean your old dream of
a house full of children?

651
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,930
I'm sorry.

652
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,820
That's the end of the self-pity. I swear.

653
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,290
If they'll just leave us alone,
I'll be happy, whatever comes.

654
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,170
No, you won't.

655
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,220
At least, not as happy
as you could have been.

656
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,040
But it's nice of you to say it.

657
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,940
Well...

658
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,130
That was an awkward mission
for you, if you like.

659
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,970
Oh, I'll say.

660
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,020
I'm sorry if you're
embarrassed, because I am.

661
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,330
I'm not embarrassed, exactly.

662
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,450
I do not believe that embarrassment
has much of a part to play

663
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,780
when something is as important as this.

664
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,040
But what am I to tell her?

665
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,130
Tell her this, Mrs Patmore.

666
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,860
That, in my eyes, she is beautiful.

667
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,250
I see.

668
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,010
You say she asks if I
want a 'full' marriage...

669
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,140
and the answer is... yes, I do.

670
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,410
I want a real marriage, a true marriage,

671
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,460
with everything that that involves...

672
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,650
.. and I hope I do not ask the indelicate

673
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,770
when I send you back
to relay this message.

674
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,820
Don't worry about me.

675
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,660
I love her, Mrs Patmore.

676
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,010
I am happy and tickled and...

677
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:04,290
bursting with pride

678
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,940
that she would agree to be my wife.

679
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,690
And I want us to live as
closely as two people can,

680
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,540
for the time that remains to us on earth.

681
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,370
Well, you couldn't make it any clearer.

682
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,420
I'll say that for you.

683
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,340
And if she feels that she must...

684
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,660
.. withdraw...

685
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
.. so be it.

686
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,220
But I could never have lived
some... pat-a-cake friendship lie.

687
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,980
No. I didn't think you would.

688
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,450
And for what it's worth, I wish
you the best of luck, Mr Carson.

689
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

690
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,100
That is worth a great deal.

691
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,320
I'm sorry to disturb Your Ladyship.

692
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,890
Yes, Spratt. What is it?

693
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:14,220
I just hope you will be kind enough
to give me sufficient warning.

694
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,370
I'm sorry, what?

695
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,210
So I may find myself alternative
employment, before I am cast out.

696
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,970
Oh, Spratt...

697
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:28,290
You have clearly had a bad dream
and are confusing it with reality.

698
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,890
Your Ladyship's humour is always a tonic,

699
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,530
but it is a matter of
some importance to me.

700
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,010
If you were talking in Urdu, I
couldn't understand you less.

701
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,970
Miss Denker has broken the news

702
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,170
that the households, here and
at the Abbey, are to be reduced.

703
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,410
- Has she?
- I do not see how you could manage

704
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,610
without a cook, a
housemaid or Miss Denker,

705
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,570
which leaves me as the
only candidate for removal.

706
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,210
Well, I believe many people live
without butlers. So I'm told.

707
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,090
Exactly. And all I ask is some
warning when my time is up.

708
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,130
Well, leave this to me,
Spratt. I will attend to it.

709
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,180
Your Ladyship.

710
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,330
So, can I go to the auction tomorrow?

711
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,810
Well, why does Mr Mason want to go,
himself? Won't it make him sad?

712
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:23,210
I think he's quite nostalgic.
He's known the family all his life.

713
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,210
- But it's bound to be upsetting.
- Which is why I want to help.

714
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,330
- Oh, I see that.
- And the new owners will be there.

715
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,090
Of course they will. They'll
want to buy a lot of stuff,

716
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,170
to make it convincing when they take over.

717
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,010
We'll be back in time for tea,
so I can do my work for dinner.

718
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,290
- But how will you get there?
- I've asked Mr Stark

719
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,650
if I can ride in the
front of one of the cars.

720
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,690
Well, you've got a nerve!
Mr Carson won't like that.

721
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:47,770
Even Mr Carson can't
always have it his own way.

722
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,450
- Ooh... - Lady Mary's out, miss, and
I don't know when she'll be back.

723
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,490
Who shall I say has called?

724
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,810
- I'll wait.
- Er...

725
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:58,530
Lady Mary could be hours, so
there's no point in waiting.

726
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,690
- I will, all the same.
- Thank you, Mr Molesley.

727
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,850
I'll deal with this.

728
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,010
I have no desire to be rude, miss,
but if you wish to see Lady Mary,

729
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,930
I suggest you make an appointment.

730
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,570
What's going on? Carson?

731
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,050
Nothing to concern you, my Lord.
This young lady is leaving.

732
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,410
On the contrary -- it will
concern you quite a lot,

733
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,260
cos I've waited for Lady Mary long enough.

734
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,300
Oh, my dear, how exotic.

735
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,530
I expect to find the whole
of the Bloomsbury Set

736
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,410
curled up in a corner with a book.

737
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,690
Michael knew quite a
few of them, actually.

738
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,370
I met Virginia Woolf in this
room, and Lytton Strachey,

739
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,170
although he didn't stay long.

740
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,010
I wish I'd known your Mr Gregson.

741
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,650
We smiled at each other and
spoke about the weather,

742
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,330
but we never really talked.

743
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,530
Sometimes I feel I've been given
one little bit of happiness,

744
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,570
and that will have to do.

745
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,690
From now on, my life
will be all of a pattern.

746
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,700
Nonsense. You have Marigold.

747
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:02,380
That's true.

748
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,530
So, what do you think I should do?

749
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:08,090
- Would you like a London life?
- The fact is, I'd like a life.

750
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,090
Well, I won't speak against London,

751
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:14,370
but remember, I had no children
to make a country life sensible.

752
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,050
Whereas I have a child
I can't acknowledge.

753
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,490
People aren't so curious in London.

754
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,690
No. They couldn't care less.

755
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,810
Isn't that a relief?

756
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,530
And then there's the museums
and galleries and theatre.

757
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,730
People always talk of such things,

758
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,340
but one only ever goes
when friends come to stay.

759
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,570
- When's your train?
- You're right. We should go.

760
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,060
But the question remains.
What is your future?

761
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:44,370
Hanging around Downton,
being sniped at by Mary?

762
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,410
Charity work? Travelling?
Publishing? What?

763
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,200
Well, that's the problem. I don't know.

764
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
I just don't know.

765
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:04,530
- I've been watching out for you.
- Why? What is it?

766
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,410
A young woman of most unappealing
aspect has been asking for you.

767
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,690
- Was her name Bevan?
- I knew she was trouble.

768
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,770
She may cause trouble for me, but
only because I've been foolish.

769
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,210
Oh, we can all be foolish, My Lady.

770
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,330
You know, Carson, some day
there'll be something I've done

771
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,290
that even you will condemn me for.

772
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,650
- I doubt that very much.
- Did she say if she'll be back?

773
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,930
She never left. I tried
to get her to go, but --

774
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,680
- Where is she now?
- In the library, with His Lordship.

775
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:40,290
- Papa, I don't know what this person
has told you... - Only the truth.

776
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,330
.. but I hope you're not giving
her any money. Not on my account.

777
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,820
Take it and go. And remember, one word...

778
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:52,050
Aren't you the lucky one?

779
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,570
But then I suppose you always are.

780
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,500
- What did she say?
- Enough.

781
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,650
I find I'm most disappointed
in Tony Gillingham.

782
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,650
Don't be.

783
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,210
He wanted us to get married.

784
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,420
Our week in sin was just part
of his plan to persuade me.

785
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,130
Then why did you say no?

786
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:28,210
Because, when it came
to it, he wasn't right.

787
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,290
At least, not for me.

788
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:33,090
And you didn't think of George?

789
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,850
Of course I did. I thought of all of you.

790
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,970
I just needed to be sure.

791
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,370
I suppose you were a widow, after all,

792
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,290
and not a deb in her first season.

793
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,090
But it's still not the way your
parents would have behaved.

794
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,730
Oh, I don't know...

795
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,570
If you believe what they
write about the Edwardians.

796
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,810
What were you planning
to do with Miss Bevan?

797
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,930
I wasn't going to be
blackmailed -- I know that.

798
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,010
So I suppose I'd have let
her publish and be damned.

799
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,400
Rather tough on Tony and Mabel.

800
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:08,610
Anyway, I'll telephone
the bank in the morning

801
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,970
and return your thousand pounds.

802
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:16,090
I gave her 50 pounds, and here's
her signed confession to blackmail.

803
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,050
How did you manage that?

804
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,330
I told her she could either have
50 pounds, on condition of signing,

805
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,820
or leave with nothing and
be reported to the police.

806
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,290
But... how do you know she won't be back?

807
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,850
I said, if anything were published
or if we ever see her face again,

808
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,440
I'd use it and she'd be prosecuted.

809
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,890
I'm impressed.

810
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,210
My darling Papa transformed
into Machiavelli at a touch.

811
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,170
Will wonders never cease?

812
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,220
Is that a compliment?

813
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,810
You're still out of pocket,
50 quid. I must repay it.

814
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:53,250
No need. It was money well spent.

815
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,730
- Why?
- To learn that my eldest child

816
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,890
is a child no more and quite
tough enough to run this estate.

817
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,250
Indeed, she could clearly run the kingdom,

818
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,840
should she be called upon to do so.

819
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,690
Well, I hope you mean that.

820
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:09,490
I do.

821
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,330
And I'm more interested than
ever to see who, in the future,

822
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,890
does come up to your exacting standards.

823
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,770
Maybe no-one.

824
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:22,530
I'd rather be alone
than with the wrong man.

825
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,610
Who was that young woman I saw leaving?

826
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,410
Someone after money. Usual thing.

827
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,890
- Did you give her any?
- Some.

828
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,370
It was quite a good cause.

829
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,130
- Has Edith telephoned?
- Yes. She'll be home for dinner.

830
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,690
I wonder if she wants to
come to Mallerton tomorrow.

831
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,970
Maybe we should all go. The
Fall Of The House Of Usher.

832
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,420
We mustn't crow. We may be next.

833
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,680
Daisy! Get upstairs. You don't
want to keep them waiting.

834
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,230
I keep thinking of what you told me.

835
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,830
- About what Mr Carson said.
- I should think so. So do I.

836
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,870
I'm sorry I put you through that.

837
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,460
It was difficult, I'll not deny it.

838
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,990
You think I should accept
his terms and set the date?

839
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,510
Oh, no, no. That's your decision.

840
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,240
I can only say he was very
moving when he spoke of you.

841
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,190
He avoided... vulgarity, then?

842
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,550
Vulgarity?

843
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,030
Mr Carson wouldn't be vulgar if
they put him on a seaside postcard.

844
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:33,110
I'd like to feel a man could
speak of me like that at my age.

845
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,200
I would.

846
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,720
Now, I must get on.

847
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,910
We must get going if we're to
look round before it starts.

848
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,710
So, it's farewell to Mallerton.

849
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,990
Why? Are you planning to turn
up your nose at the new owners?

850
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,470
No. I just don't think
I'll be in Yorkshire

851
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,670
quite so much in the future.

852
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,710
What a funny thing to say.

853
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,750
It's time to go forward,

854
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,030
and I'm unmarried, so I must do it alone.

855
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,070
That sounds rather severe.

856
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,630
I think it sounds very positive.

857
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,990
Thank you, Baxter.

858
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,950
Mr Carson, when you said we'd
know if there was a plan --

859
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,880
Excuse me, while I see them off.

860
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,470
Well, he doesn't seem that
bothered, so it can't be that bad.

861
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,630
You and I both know that the worse it is,

862
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,710
the less he'll want to seem bothered.

863
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,310
Besides, they all want
to be rid of me anyway.

864
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,590
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

865
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,270
You've seen how they warn
Andy to keep away from me.

866
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,310
We got on very well when he first arrived,

867
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,190
but now he hardly dares to talk to me.

868
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,110
I think this is all in your head.

869
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,000
No, it's not.

870
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,030
Oh, good. You're here.

871
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,910
I just took a chance.

872
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,670
I thought you might be at
the auction with the others.

873
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,710
I don't like auctions,

874
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,390
especially when I knew
the house in the old days.

875
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,510
I hate to see people's
things piled up in a heap.

876
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,310
Like so much rubbish.

877
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,510
Well, you and I differ when it
comes to the importance of things.

878
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,870
Does it ever get cold on
the moral high ground (?)

879
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,510
I wanted to come because I
don't want us to fall out

880
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:25,470
over the hospital.

881
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,550
I need to be sure that we can disagree,

882
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,390
without there being any
bad feeling between us.

883
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,990
- Well, it depends who wins.
- Surely not!

884
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,670
Which means you are confident of victory.

885
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,510
Well, we shall see.

886
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,550
Shall I ring for some tea?

887
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,160
It's rather early, but
I think we deserve it.

888
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,190
I remember Mallerton in the 1860s.

889
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,230
Dear old Lady Darnley.

890
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,790
Always liked to stuff
the place with royalty.

891
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,830
She was addicted to curtseying!

892
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,790
How we laughed.

893
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,750
It's sad to think about it.

894
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,950
- Ah, Spratt. Could we have some tea?
- Your Ladyship.

895
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,510
It seemed a little chilly, m'lady,
so I've brought you a shawl.

896
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,750
- Oh, you are a wonder, Denker.
- Thank you.

897
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,750
- I shall miss you.
- M'lady?

898
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,830
Oh, I'm sorry. No, forget I said that.

899
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,390
After all, nothing is settled.

900
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,990
What's not settled?

901
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,750
I don't understand.

902
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,230
I thought you told Spratt
about the staff being cut

903
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,110
back here and at the Abbey.

904
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,390
Well, I... may have mentioned it.

905
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,350
Oh, well. As I said, nothing's decided.

906
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,150
But Your Ladyship couldn't
manage without a maid.

907
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,550
Mrs Crawley does. Don't you?

908
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,910
Indeed I do,

909
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,390
but I don't wish to upset poor Denker.

910
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,790
But Mrs Crawley also manages
without a butler, m'lady.

911
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,710
That is true,

912
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,270
but I don't think I could break
with tradition to quite that degree.

913
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,750
Shall we have some tea?

914
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,790
Your Ladyship.

915
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,840
Miss Denker?

916
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,390
Don't worry, Miss Denker.

917
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,040
I've got a copy of The Lady upstairs.

918
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,470
You don't really mean to manage
without a lady's maid, do you?

919
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,190
Certainly not!

920
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,600
- Then why did you --
- Sometimes it's good to rule by fear.

921
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,270
I can hardly believe it.

922
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,350
I used to come here all the time as a boy.

923
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,710
Sic transit gloria mundi.

924
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,960
Will you be as philosophical
when it's our turn?

925
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,710
Crikey. They're selling everything.

926
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,350
This is John's grandmother,
for God's sake.

927
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,470
They must think it's too large.

928
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:30,510
Too large for London.

929
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,430
Dear John. We're so sorry.

930
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,470
At least I hope it's what you want.

931
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,030
But it isn't. Not at all.

932
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,070
You're having quite a clean sweep.

933
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,750
We've kept a few portraits to make
a decent show in the London house,

934
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,030
but what's the point of storing the rest?

935
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,070
This life is over for
us. It won't come back.

936
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,030
I admire you. Too many people
just hang on and hang on,

937
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,870
instead of facing things
as they really are.

938
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,710
But we did hang on, I'm afraid.
We hung on for far too long.

939
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,590
And now there's nothing left.

940
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,640
Learn from us.

941
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,670
Ah, there are the Hendersons.

942
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,750
Is there anything you'd like
to buy, or are we just looking?

943
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,270
I wanted to see the house
as much as anything.

944
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,230
I know this hall from
Christmas parties and the like,

945
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,880
but er... I've a mind to poke around.

946
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,230
That were a wedding present
when Sir John got married.

947
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,910
A gift from the tenants. I
contributed half a crown to it.

948
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,670
Had no beer for a week.
Shame to see it sold.

949
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,710
I don't think it's right.

950
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:36,030
That was for Best of
Breed at the county fair.

951
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,070
Won by a Holstein milker.

952
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,750
My dad tended the Holsteins
before he took over our farm.

953
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,830
It's as if they were selling
your past along with their own.

954
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,670
That's them.

955
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,310
That's the new owners. Mr
and Mrs Philip Henderson.

956
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,710
The ones who won't guarantee
that you can stay on?

957
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,470
- Hey, Daisy. There's no need to --
- I'm not having it. - Daisy!

958
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,270
- It won't do any good.
- I have to say something!

959
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,110
It's not fair!

960
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Who is this person?

961
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,030
She's the daughter-in-law of
one of our tenant farmers.

962
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,590
Excuse me, but are you the new owner?

963
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,070
- I am. - So it's you who
insists on serving notice to men

964
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,190
who've given their whole life to the land?

965
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,390
- Daisy! - You boot out families
who've been here for generations.

966
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,390
- What gives you the right to do that?
- Mrs Mason, there's really no --

967
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,190
I don't think you're the man to tell me.

968
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,790
Pull yourself together. What
do you think you're doing?

969
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,630
A man who sells his wedding presents?

970
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,390
Do you know what it meant for
a farmer to give half a crown?

971
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,870
- Or don't you care?
- Daisy, stop this at once!

972
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,910
I'm sorry, m'lord, but no.

973
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,710
Mr Mason has given his
whole life to this farm,

974
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,190
like his father and
grandfather before him,

975
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,230
but where's the gratitude?

976
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,630
Mr Henderson, I'm sure she
doesn't mean to be rude.

977
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,350
You can't imagine that if I do
keep on some of the tenants,

978
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,470
her father-in-law would now be among them?

979
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,070
Now, please don't be hasty.
She's upset for old Mason --

980
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,830
I'm sorry, Darnley. I don't
find this sort of thing amusing.

981
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,030
Good day, Mrs Mason. You
have not helped your cause.

982
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,390
- I'm speaking for myself, not --
- Good day, Mrs Mason.

983
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,150
Now, will you excuse me?
The auction's starting.

984
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,830
- I'm sure she didn't mean any
- Oh, God. What have I done?

985
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,550
I daresay he'll cool off.

986
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,800
I wouldn't put money on it.

987
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,620
We should find our chairs.

988
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,110
Good afternoon, lords,
ladies and gentlemen.

989
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,350
The first lot consists of
a set of sporting prints

990
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,710
from the mid-19th century. Who
would like to start the bidding?

991
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,190
Two pounds, anyone? Two
pounds to start with.

992
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,110
We're selling things we shouldn't have.

993
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,110
But I kept thinking of that poky
little house in Thurloe Square

994
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,150
- and I couldn't see what else to do.
- You might have stored some of it,

995
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,910
in case one of the children
starts up another house one day.

996
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,030
That's a dream. Face it.

997
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,750
In 20 years' time, there won't be
a house of this size still standing

998
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,630
that isn't an institution.

999
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,720
One pound, seventeen and six. And sold!

1000
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,630
That's it.

1001
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,710
They're in the drawing room,
they've got coffee and we're done.

1002
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,510
- How was your day?
- Not very good.

1003
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,790
I'm sure it's not as bad as you
say. Mr Henderson will understand.

1004
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,710
No, he won't. I went to help
and I've made things worse.

1005
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,590
- This was in front of His Lordship?
- In front of all of them.

1006
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,030
- Could prove awkward!
- Thank you, Thomas (!)

1007
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,110
If they dismiss me, I've got
no-one but myself to blame.

1008
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,550
- It won't come to that, Daisy.
- What will happen to Mr Mason now?

1009
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,390
What can he do? Try to find
another farm to take on as tenant,

1010
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,630
- but who'll let him at his age?
- It's a good life, though, isn't it?

1011
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,390
Are you turning into a country boy?

1012
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,230
You'll have to let me show you around.

1013
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,630
Andy can find his own way round.
He looks sharp enough to me.

1014
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,630
No, no. Come in, come in.

1015
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,440
They're here, or they were a minute ago.

1016
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,830
Sergeant Willis has something to tell you.

1017
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,430
I'm sorry it's late, but I
thought you'd want to hear.

1018
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,110
- That depends what it is.
- Shall we go somewhere private?

1019
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,150
For God's sake, they've all lived
with this as long as we have.

1020
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,630
They've found a witness
to the meeting in the pub.

1021
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,590
They've tied them together.
Her confession is real.

1022
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,630
This time, it IS over.

1023
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,750
- Oh, I can't believe it!
- I shouldn't have come until now.

1024
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,590
I'm sorry. I should have waited.

1025
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,040
- Never mind that.
- I'll go and tell His Lordship.

1026
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,790
You both helped us when all hope was gone,

1027
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,710
and I'll not forget it.

1028
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,830
I find it hard to acknowledge a
debt but we owe a debt to you.

1029
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,870
Justice has triumphed.

1030
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,720
I'm not always convinced that
it does, but it has tonight.

1031
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,150
We must go down at once.

1032
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,190
What can we give them to drink?

1033
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,230
It depends how far you want to go, m'lord.

1034
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,270
There's some Veuve Cliquot in
a very cool part of the cellar.

1035
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,870
It's not iced, of course, but
it would be good to drink.

1036
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,350
Fetch it. Fetch three, four
bottles! We must mark this moment.

1037
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,590
It's been such a long road. Can
this really be the end of it?

1038
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,240
It seems so. And a happy ending!

1039
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,430
Anna!

1040
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,510
I knew this day would come, I really did.

1041
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,350
Everyone, take a glass, quick as you can,

1042
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,480
while I propose a toast.

1043
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,310
British justice! Envy of the world.

1044
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,350
I suppose if it comes
out right in the end.

1045
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,870
We could've done with the
result a little sooner.

1046
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,750
Amen to that, m'lady.

1047
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,950
Andy, Daisy, go and fetch the gramophone.

1048
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,230
We never seem to use it
now Lady Rose has gone.

1049
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,110
Do we know any more about the
woman who did it, Sergeant Willis?

1050
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,870
Only that she sent a message
to Mrs Bates, m'lady.

1051
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,070
She says she's sorry for leaving
it so long to take the blame.

1052
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,750
- That's all very well --
- Give her a message from me.

1053
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,790
Say I forgive her. Wish her luck.

1054
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,830
What will they do now?

1055
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,350
She'll serve time for
manslaughter. She won't hang.

1056
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,390
So Mr Green goes on ruining lives.

1057
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,950
But not your life. Not any more.

1058
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,390
I'm sorry for what we've
put you through, Mrs Bates.

1059
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,470
I probably shouldn't say it, but I am.

1060
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:50,150
You did no more than your
duty, Sergeant Willis.

1061
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,150
We'll leave you to it.
Good night. Sleep well.

1062
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,800
There's more wine if you finish this.

1063
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,990
We'll sleep tonight, all right.

1064
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,340
And wake tomorrow without
that rock on our chests.

1065
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,390
I think I might go into
Thirsk in the morning,

1066
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,150
visit some estate agents.

1067
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,870
Start planning again.

1068
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,920
But not for a family.

1069
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,550
I'm afraid we can't plan for that.

1070
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,590
We're free.

1071
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,840
We're safe, and I have you.

1072
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,630
That's enough, I promise.

1073
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,670
I know you want it to be true,

1074
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,710
and I love you for it.

1075
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,790
So much.

1076
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:30,310
And I love you.

1077
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,310
- What are you doing?
- Is this the refrigerator?

1078
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,350
It is.

1079
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,600
- Mrs Patmore hates it.
- Oh, of course she does.

1080
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,070
Don't eat anything
that's meant for tomorrow.

1081
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,910
Now, this takes me back.

1082
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,070
Did I ever tell you about our
cook when I was a boy, Mrs Yardley?

1083
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,870
Many times.

1084
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,750
She was quite a crosspatch,
but she was always kind to me.

1085
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,710
She used to let me hide down
here when I was in trouble.

1086
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,390
She kept a box of biscuits
and sweets just for me.

1087
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,830
- Rosamund was furious.
- Rosamund was jealous.

1088
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,110
Come to bed.

1089
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,390
Sorry, Carson. We shouldn't be here.

1090
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,430
Oh, quite all right, m'lady.

1091
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,550
But I did want a private word
on the question of Daisy.

1092
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,630
I've heard what happened at the auction.

1093
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,950
I don't believe we can
allow it to go unnoticed.

1094
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,230
- No, I suppose not.
- It is a dismissible offence.

1095
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,230
Oh, isn't that a bit harsh? On
the day of Bates' good news?

1096
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,230
I'm sure she regrets it.

1097
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,590
I daresay Guy Fawkes regretted
trying to blow up Parliament,

1098
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,870
m'lady, but he still had to pay the price.

1099
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,670
Can't you just tick her off?

1100
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,190
You'll know how to ensure
there's no repetition.

1101
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,670
Very good, m'lady, if
that's what you wish.

1102
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:45,710
We're going up. Good night.

1103
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,960
Good night, m'lord, m'lady.

1104
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,150
Have you thought about where
the Carsons will live?

1105
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,110
- After they're married?
- Not really.

1106
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,150
I'd rather put it out of my mind.

1107
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,190
Will we have to call her Mrs Carson?

1108
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,150
I'm not sure I can.

1109
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,670
We have higher mountains to climb.

1110
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,470
Have you come to a decision
about the hospital?

1111
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,510
What sort of a decision?

1112
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:12,070
I suppose I hope you can support
Mama's efforts to keep control.

1113
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,830
Better yet, stay out of it entirely.

1114
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:17,750
I can't stay out of it,
Robert. It's too important.

1115
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,110
And your mother, incidentally, is wrong.

1116
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,230
All of which adds up to a very
trying spring and summer ahead.

1117
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,390
I suppose you thought
there'd be no repercussions,

1118
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,430
what with Mr Bates' news.

1119
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,590
No. I knew I hadn't heard the last of it.

1120
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,630
I just want to know how bad it'll be.

1121
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,390
Bad enough, I hope, to make you
feel small and foolish and immature,

1122
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,790
and unable to control your
feelings in an adult manner.

1123
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,870
I feel all those things already.

1124
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,230
But not bad enough for
you to lose your place.

1125
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,510
If it were up to me,
it might be different.

1126
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,030
But Her Ladyship insisted
on a second chance.

1127
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,870
- Thank you, Mr Carson.
- Don't thank me, thank her.

1128
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:10,320
Now, get back to the party
before I change my mind.

1129
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,750
Right, well, shall we rejoin the others?

1130
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,800
Before we do...

1131
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,240
.. I know I've been putting you off...

1132
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:43,350
.. and Mrs Patmore spoke
of your conversation.

1133
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,390
I knew she would.

1134
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,590
I hope we've not shocked you between us.

1135
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:50,510
No, I'm not shocked.

1136
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,550
I thought it better to be honest.

1137
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:54,590
Once you'd raised the matter.

1138
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,630
I agree. Much better.

1139
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,710
I wouldn't want you to think
that I'd inveigled you

1140
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,070
into an arrangement which
was not what you'd expected.

1141
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,190
I would never think that.

1142
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,230
Right.

1143
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,470
Well, if you've had second thoughts,

1144
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,310
I think we should let the
staff know in the morning.

1145
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,350
I won't make a big announcement.

1146
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,590
We'll just tell one or two people
and let it come out naturally.

1147
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:23,110
There'll be a bit of a nine
days' wonder, of course,

1148
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,510
but we'll get over it.

1149
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,760
But you misunderstand me.

1150
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,310
I was afraid I'd be a
disappointment to you.

1151
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,160
That I couldn't hope to
please you as I am now.

1152
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,360
But if you're sure...

1153
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,960
I have never been so sure of anything.

1154
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,710
Well, then, Mr Carson...

1155
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,670
If you want me, you can have me.

1156
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,920
To quote Oliver Cromwell, warts and all.

1157
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:15,470
I don't want to be a servant on
my wedding day. Is that so wrong?

1158
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,750
The battle lines are drawn,
now we must fight it out.

1159
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,270
- I hope you are not implying she would
be more powerful than I. - Oh, no, indeed.

1160
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:23,550
Mary took Marigold to
the Drewes' farm today.

1161
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,790
When a woman loves a child,
it must stay with her.

1162
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:29,150
As you're aware, this is
the day of the Malton Show.

1163
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,830
Does it ever occur to you
that you might be wrong?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

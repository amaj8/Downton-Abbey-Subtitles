1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,210
Tom writes that they've
opened the new sale room.

2
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,770
What about Rose? What does
she have to say for herself?

3
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,130
Oh, everything's good. New York is heaven.

4
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,810
They're taking a house in
the Hamptons for the summer.

5
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,140
- Ah! I think she could be pregnant.
- Golly! Why do you say that?

6
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,010
She says, 'I might be back in August,

7
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,690
but it's a bit early to say.'

8
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,300
As usual, you add two and
two and make 53. Busy day?

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,250
Granny's asked me to look in later.

10
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,170
It'll be about the hospital
business. Have you told Mama?

11
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,300
- To be honest, Granny said not to.
- You're mad if you don't.

12
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,450
She's a trustee, she belongs there.

13
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,730
Not all the trustees
can be at every meeting

14
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,170
and I want to see if there
is some way to sort it out

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,890
before there's blood on the carpet.

16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,650
- What is it?
- There's a man downstairs, My Lady.

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,450
- Mr Finch is here to see the agent.
- I'll see him.

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,130
I suggested that but he said

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,460
he doesn't want to bother you,
or His Lordship, 'just the agent'.

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,850
Wait ten minutes and show
him into the library.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,250
- Very good, My Lady.
- You'll have to manage him.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,100
I've got some errands to run and
I promised I'd meet Granny at 11.

23
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,050
I want to be left to
manage him. It's my job.

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,730
How are preparations for
the wedding coming along?

25
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,450
Slowly but surely, My Lord.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,490
We've settled a date with Mr Travis

27
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,250
and now we have to decide
where to hold the reception,

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,660
- what there is of one. - Well,
here of course. - Absolutely.

29
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,900
We can decorate the servants' hall
and make it look really special.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,540
That's kind, My Lord. As I say,
we haven't yet made the decision.

31
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,690
Don't forget poor Mr Finch.

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,650
Honestly, Papa, 'We'll
decorate the servants' hall'!

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,210
- Surely we can do better than that.
- What do you mean?

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,330
I don't want to discuss
it now. I'm in a rush.

35
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,920
We'll have a proper conversation later.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,980
I know it's cheating, but I think
I might get a jar of horseradish.

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,650
It really isn't bad now.

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,690
- That's not like you.
- True.

39
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,220
We could use it in sandwiches without
having to go through the palaver.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,570
- Can I borrow some soda,
Mrs Patmore? - Borrow?

41
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,290
So you'll give it back (?)

42
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
Any more news on Mr Mason?

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,060
Only that he's losing home and
livelihood and it's all my fault.

44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,410
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes, it is, I caused it.

45
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,210
If it weren't for my big mouth,
he might've had a reprieve.

46
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,610
- That's not what Miss Baxter says.
- She wasn't there.

47
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,860
Have you finished your order list?
I'll send them out this afternoon.

48
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,180
I'll take them up to Mr Bakewell.
I'm going into the village later.

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,060
That's kind. I think I'll walk
down to the Home Farm myself.

50
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,740
I'll join you.

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,530
We'll be back by 12.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,260
Right you are.

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,970
I'm sorry I'm a letdown, Mr Finch.

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,290
Not a letdown, milady,
I wouldn't say that,

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,730
only I need to discuss the
estate's entries this year

56
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,770
in the fat stock show at Malton.

57
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,690
You won't want to be bothered with it.

58
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,170
I thought all the shows
took place before Christmas?

59
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,730
They do, usually. This is an experiment.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,930
And you've come to discuss
it with Mr Branson.

61
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,690
I know that's not possible, milady,

62
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,810
but if you could tell
me who's replaced him...

63
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,650
Hold onto your hat, Mr
Finch, but I'm afraid I have.

64
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,780
Mm-hm... Hm.

65
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,420
I see.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,730
I've been working with
Mr Branson for some years

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,370
and now I intend to manage
myself, with His Lordship.

68
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,900
- Well... it's a changing world.
- It certainly is.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,570
We're anxious the show
shouldn't be a letdown, milady,

70
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,210
so we're really hoping for a
decent entry from the Abbey.

71
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,690
We did well with the pigs in
the other fat stock shows,

72
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,490
so let me discuss it with our pig man.

73
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,410
You see, these shows don't
have the buzz of a county show,

74
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,660
but a decent turnout from the surviving
estates means they're taken seriously.

75
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,650
The key word being surviving.

76
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
Hm.

77
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,620
'Decorate the servants' hall'?

78
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,660
I'm not sure how enticing that sounds.

79
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,220
- It was meant kindly.
- I daresay.

80
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,090
What would you like us to do?

81
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,080
If I'm honest, I'd like
to get away for the day.

82
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,060
Find somewhere local, where
we can throw our own party,

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,090
instead of a gathering by
courtesy of the Crawley family.

84
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,730
You do mean to invite them?

85
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,580
Of course I do.

86
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,890
Why, did you think you
would have to get married

87
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,650
without Lady Mary to witness it?

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,650
She's an important figure
in my life, Mrs Hughes.

89
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,090
- I won't apologise.
- Nor do you have to.

90
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,460
I just don't want to be a
servant on my wedding day.

91
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,500
Is that so wrong?

92
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,410
What should I tell His Lordship?

93
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,530
Tell him thank you, but no.

94
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,100
This seems very formal.

95
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,580
The Royal Yorkshire has written to
all our financial donors to canvas
their support for the takeover.

96
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,100
- Which you'll agree is very sneaky.
- I think it's sensible.

97
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,290
The principle benefit
of the new arrangement

98
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,380
will be to make our money raising
activities more coherent and logical.

99
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,580
There's no government funding
available, either to them or to us.

100
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,020
Which means we'll become a ward
of the larger establishment,

101
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,890
while the local community
forfeit any claims

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,090
to being treated in their own village.

103
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,730
Well, that depends how we
divide the new departments.

104
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,860
In the end, surely, it comes down
to how many lives will be saved.

105
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,980
- Precisely. - Lord Grantham, are
you saying we don't save lives?

106
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,700
- No, of course not. - If you can't say
anything helpful, Robert, please be silent.

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,980
- Helpful to whom? And why isn't Cora here?
- It doesn't concern her.

108
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,370
I am the president, you are the almoner,

109
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,500
Dr Clarkson runs the hospital
and Robert is the patron

110
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,700
and his father gave the land
on which the hospital is built.

111
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,260
- The four of us constitute a quorum.
- I disagree.

112
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,650
Tell her about this
meeting and, when you do,

113
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,540
say that Cousin Violet would have
kept the rest of us away if she could.

114
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,580
Don't give me ideas.

115
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,370
I suppose you've settled into
the routine by this time.

116
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,010
I think so. I like it here.

117
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,010
- It's quite a change from Bayswater.
- It's a change that suits me.

118
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,850
I've been getting to know the
estate when I've got time off.

119
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,500
- I thought I'd look at the woods.
- I'll come with you, if you like.

120
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,330
No, you're all right. I like to
walk on my own, if I'm honest.

121
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,490
I agree with you, Andy,
it's very liberating.

122
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,540
If you say so.

123
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,180
Mr Carson, I don't suppose there's any
more news on when you'll be serving notice?

124
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,340
Nobody's going to be flung into
the road, I can assure you.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:55,500
No, but I mean... should I
start looking for another job?

126
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,320
How could it hurt?

127
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,540
At least you know you won't be asked to
leave until you've got somewhere to go.

128
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,490
- I don't know anything of the
sort. - But you heard him. - No.

129
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,410
What I heard is that I'm for the chop

130
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,460
and they won't wait forever
to make it come true.

131
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,370
- Mr Dawes...
- Mr Molesley.

132
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,380
.. might I have a word?

133
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,810
There's no point in
shouting at me, Mr Skinner.

134
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,220
I want what you want: a
magazine people like to read.

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,250
I don't understand why you're so angry.

136
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,740
I'm simply making suggestions.

137
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,890
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

138
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,610
I will be up tomorrow, so
we can talk about it then

139
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,940
but, please, try and keep
calm until I get there.

140
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,780
Goodbye.

141
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,060
We should finish up. The children
will be here in a minute.

142
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,980
- Who was it?
- Mr Skinner in his usual form.

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,050
He hates my ideas for the editorial,

144
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,290
he hates my suggestions for interviews

145
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,930
and he hates the new
photographs we've commissioned.

146
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,970
Sounds as if he hates running a magazine.

147
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,450
He hates me. Let's leave it at that.

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,820
I'll have to go up to London, which
is a nuisance, but there you are.

149
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,530
How did the meeting go?

150
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,370
Dr Clarkson wants to win your
mother over to Granny's team.

151
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,410
- And will he?
- I don't believe so.

152
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,290
I suppose he likes being his
own boss and who can blame him?

153
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,580
Is that fair? It's always been a huge
plus that we have our own hospital

154
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,490
- and he wants to retain it.
- So whose side are you on?

155
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,220
I wish I didn't have to decide.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,050
- Ah!
- Hello, my darling.

157
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,860
How was your day?

158
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,650
I never asked what that man
was here for this morning.

159
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,650
Malton is holding a late
fat stock show this year.

160
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,260
- That sounds rather small beer. Is
it worth the bother? - I think so.

161
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,770
Two of the pigs are
proven winners after all.

162
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,820
- I'm going to look at them tomorrow.
- Can we come? - I don't see why not.

163
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,860
I'll tell Nanny.

164
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,330
You want to take them to the Drewes' farm?

165
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,370
You can come with us if you like.

166
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,780
But is it a good idea? Is it safe?

167
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,490
Don't be such a ninny. I've
said you can come if you want.

168
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,490
It'll be nice for them to see Marigold.

169
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,530
But I have to be in London now.

170
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,140
I'll go.

171
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,050
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- How exciting!

172
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,100
We'll all look at the
pigs, then we'll come home.

173
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,410
- Are you on your own?
- Looks like it.

174
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,250
Cos I've got something for you.

175
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,290
Oh, yes? What's that, then?

176
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,410
You know I went into the village earlier?

177
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,130
- I looked in at the school,
while I was there. - Go on...

178
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,570
I spoke to the headmaster
about your examination.

179
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,930
Well, about examinations
in general, really.

180
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,940
Anyway...

181
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,780
He suggested, before we fix a date,

182
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,300
you might like a go at some old
papers from the last few years.

183
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,970
You mean real exams that people sat?

184
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,610
- That was kind of you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

185
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,780
He took me through them. In fact,
it was really rather interesting.

186
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,810
I just wish Mr Mason was settled.

187
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,850
If you passed your exams, you'd
be in a better place to help him.

188
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,690
Maybe, but first, I've
got to make them listen.

189
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,660
Her Ladyship was there and she
tried to calm the new owner down,

190
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,780
- so she must be sympathetic.
- Daisy, we're servants.

191
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,860
I have to do something.

192
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,980
Is anything the matter?

193
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
No.

194
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,170
I mean, you're free.

195
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,980
Bates is free, the threat's gone away.

196
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,020
I'd expect you to be wreathed in smiles

197
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,700
but, instead, you seem rather cast down.

198
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,610
Life's never simple is it, milady?

199
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,600
You don't have to tell
me, if you don't want to.

200
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,300
It's almost funny really, given the
service I once performed for you.

201
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,100
You know Mr Bates and I have
always wanted children...?

202
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,580
And you'll have some now, I'm sure.

203
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
No, I won't.

204
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,980
It seems I can't.

205
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,700
Anna, no woman living

206
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,220
has been put through more of
an emotional wringer than you.

207
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,420
It doesn't surprise me in the least
that you haven't got pregnant.

208
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,300
That's the point, I can get
pregnant, I just can't keep it.

209
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,650
And how many times has this happened?

210
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,780
Two, maybe three.

211
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,300
Well, I still say your life has been
so filled with stress and worry...

212
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,340
It's all right, milady.

213
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,380
I'm used to the idea.

214
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,560
Some women can't have
children and I'm one of them.

215
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,650
Now, if that will be all...

216
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Yes, thank you.

217
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,860
Hello.

218
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,930
- Do you post your own letters?
- Ha!

219
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,940
It was vital it went off today and
I'm never very good at delegating.

220
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,570
As a matter of fact, I'm glad to see you.

221
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,580
I'd value your advice.

222
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,650
I've had a letter from the
Royal Yorkshire Hospital,

223
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,650
asking if I'd head the new
Board of Charitable Donors.

224
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,690
We'd be working alongside.

225
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,180
Well, that's if I stay the
almoner, once we've amalgamated.

226
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,300
Well, of course you would. When we combine,
we'll avoid duplicating our efforts.

227
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,500
The whole thing would work a lot
more efficiently than it does now.

228
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,650
So you don't disagree with the plan?

229
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,730
Well, don't you see what it could mean?

230
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,890
How old is our X-ray machine?

231
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,290
Does Clarkson really know how to use it?

232
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,380
What advanced surgery do we offer? None.

233
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,170
If a family at the Abbey has a
cut finger, they go to London,

234
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,460
- but what about everyone else?
- I bet you'd go to London too.

235
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,210
I probably would, but I shouldn't have to.

236
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,010
And what about people who
don't have that option?

237
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,460
So the battle lines are drawn
and now we must fight it out.

238
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,880
Well, I'm glad we're to be allies.

239
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,170
I must be going.

240
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,460
I assume old Lady Grantham
is still bitterly opposed?

241
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,820
Of course, so there'll be wigs
on the green before we're done.

242
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,240
So be it. Wigs on the green it is.

243
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,860
Poor Daisy's in a terrible state
about Mr Mason losing his farm.

244
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,180
I don't blame her, it's a beautiful
place and he's a lovely man.

245
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,340
She seems to think that Her
Ladyship might want to help.

246
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,780
I don't see how. I mean, they like
Mr Mason, but what can they do?

247
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,460
The way she talks, they didn't
much take to the new owners.

248
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,290
But do you think you could ask?

249
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,460
I can tell her Daisy's worried,
but I can't do more than that.

250
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,020
Very well. I'd better get on.

251
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,930
- I shouldn't get involved.
- No.

252
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,140
And you don't like to get
involved in helping others, do you?

253
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm trying to help you.

254
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,050
- Anything interesting?
- Is this interesting?

255
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,380
'Assistant butler, varied
duties, start at once.'

256
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,250
- Then there's a Ripon number.
- Oh.

257
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,820
- It would be nice if you didn't have
to move far away. - Nice for whom?

258
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,660
You won't let me be fond of you,
will you? No matter what I do.

259
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,620
- Did I leave a tin of oil in here?
- I put it on the mantelpiece. - Oh.

260
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,460
Mr Carson wants me to wind the clocks.

261
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,780
I've an idea the one in the tapestry
room needs extra loving care.

262
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,090
I used to wind the clocks.
Do you want some help?

263
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,820
Don't worry, Mr Barrow, I looked
after the clocks in my last place.

264
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,850
What's an assistant butler
when it's at home, anyway?

265
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,040
That's what I'd like to know.

266
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,220
- Well, they're big enough.
- They're good animals, milady.

267
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,570
They've done well and
they will again at Malton.

268
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,330
Hey, Miss Marigold!

269
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,140
Does Lady Edith know you're here?

270
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,690
She would've come herself,
but she's in London.

271
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,340
- So you're happy to enter them
for the show? - Very happy.

272
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,020
- Where's Mrs Drewe? - She's gone
into town, but she'll be back soon.

273
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,930
- We should probably get home.
- Well, there's no great rush.

274
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,850
- Won't Mrs Drewe want to see
Marigold? - Well -- - Yes, I would.

275
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,940
It's kind of you, milady.

276
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,540
I'd love to look at her.

277
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,220
Hello.

278
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,540
- Do you remember me? - Of course she
remembers you, don't you, darling?

279
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,220
It's been so nice, but I think we ought
to get them back for their luncheon.

280
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,700
Back to the big house for luncheon.

281
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Let her go, Margie.

282
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,220
We mustn't hold them up.

283
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,340
That's it, my love, you come
with me, back to your auntie.

284
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,620
Good, well, I'll send a note
to Mr Finch in the afternoon.

285
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Thank you, Mr Drewe.

286
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,620
(I hope that's the last
time anyone calls me Auntie.)

287
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,860
Right, back to work.

288
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,820
Mr Carson?

289
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,660
I wonder if I could have some time
off, this afternoon, for an interview?

290
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,730
Interview? What, for a job?

291
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,060
Yes, it's quite local --
Rothley Manor near Ripon.

292
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,220
I telephoned and they
said to look in today.

293
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,810
You don't let the grass grow, I must say.

294
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,780
- So I can go?
- Be my guest.

295
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
Thank you, Mr Carson.

296
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,100
Good luck.

297
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,720
If I was lucky, I wouldn't be leaving.

298
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,330
- Did the children like the pigs?
- They loved them.

299
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,530
Drewe was as proud as
punch showing them off.

300
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,660
- Was Mrs Drewe there?
- She came just before we left

301
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,370
and she enjoyed seeing
Marigold, didn't she, Mama?

302
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,980
- She was quite overcome.
- Yes, I think she was very pleased.

303
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,780
Is that luncheon?

304
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,900
Carson, when Papa offered to
decorate the servants' hall,

305
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,970
he wasn't really thinking.

306
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,460
If you'd like your reception to be
here, we can hold it in the hall,

307
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,170
or whichever room you choose.

308
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,010
That's very kind of you, My Lady.

309
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,810
Not a bit, we'd be
delighted, wouldn't we, Papa?

310
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,970
But you must feel free to refuse.

311
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,010
Oh, there's not much chance of that.

312
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,010
- Speak to Mrs Hughes, she may
feel differently. - Why should she?

313
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,660
She just may, that's all, it's
her wedding. Shall we go in?

314
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,340
Of course, I'd have been very happy
in the servants' hall, My Lord...

315
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,170
Don't worry, Carson, there's
no point even pretending

316
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,500
that we can argue with
Lady Mary, either of us.

317
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,180
This isn't right.

318
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,490
- Give me a moment, I'll be fine. - No.

319
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,930
I mean, it's not right
for you to cry alone.

320
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,900
You're married and that means you
never have to cry alone again.

321
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,040
I told Lady Mary last night.

322
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,180
She was kind, of course, but
it just brought it all back.

323
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Have you ever thought about adoption?

324
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,420
Yes, but... I don't believe
it would work for you.

325
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,290
You're tribal, Mr Bates,

326
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,140
and the tribe doesn't
have a lot of members.

327
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,700
You want your own child.
No substitute will do.

328
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,780
But what do YOU want?

329
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,540
See. You gave yourself
away by not denying it.

330
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,420
We must learn to be content as we are...

331
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,010
.. which is easy for me.

332
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,620
But it's my fault, not yours, that
I can't give you what you need.

333
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,580
To me, we are one person and
that person can't have children.

334
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
I love you.

335
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Of course I understand you
may have read many magazines

336
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,930
whilst having your hair done
or waiting for the dentist,

337
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,260
but that does not mean you're an
expert in how to produce them!

338
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,730
You know, there is no need
to shout, I am not deaf.

339
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,570
Oh, really? Are you sure?

340
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,940
Because you seem to have such
difficulty in hearing what I am saying.

341
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,850
- It's drier than they said it
would be in the newspapers. - Yes.

342
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,100
It's brightening up, isn't it?

343
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,370
- Let's go. - We'll have lunch
and then you can come back.

344
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
There's no point.

345
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,020
- What a terrible man.
- He didn't sound very conciliatory.

346
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,140
The truth is, I've come up to
London to have my nose bitten off

347
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,980
and that's not all.

348
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,580
Mama telephoned. Mary took
Marigold to the Drewes' farm today.

349
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,330
- I knew she was planning it.
- Well, why didn't you stop her?

350
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,260
Well, how? George was
aching to see the pigs

351
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,210
and what possible reason could
I give for stopping Marigold?

352
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,650
Well, you could've said
it would upset Mrs Drewe.

353
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,610
Wouldn't Mary have wondered why
I was making such a thing of it?

354
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,460
- You're going to have to tell her one day.
- I don't see why.

355
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,060
- How's Granny?
- Embarking on a civil war.

356
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,050
They want to change the way
they run the local hospital.

357
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,090
Change? Mama won't like that.

358
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,260
She's in one camp with Dr
Clarkson, who isn't a fan either,

359
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,530
- and Isobel's in the other.
- And your parents?

360
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,060
Mama agrees with Isobel. Papa
doesn't want to take sides.

361
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,680
Well, if I know Granny, he'll have to.

362
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,890
So you're under butler at Downton Abbey.

363
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,650
Yes, I've been there for a long time.

364
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,820
I first arrived as a junior
footman about 15 years ago.

365
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,890
- Another world.
- So it seems.

366
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,980
Of course, I was away at the
war in the middle of that.

367
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,500
- Why are you leaving now?
- It seems like the right time for a move.

368
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,740
Does it? Does it, indeed?

369
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,780
Tell me, Mr Moore, what exactly
is an assistant butler?

370
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,650
I'm not familiar with the term.

371
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,370
No, well, we made it up.

372
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,140
Ah, so the duties of an assistant butler
are not the same as an under butler.

373
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,380
I think you have to climb down
from that high horse, Mr Barrow.

374
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,140
This is 1925.

375
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,460
We'd need you to combine the duties of a
footman -- when needed -- and a chauffeur.

376
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,740
- There's no chauffeur?
- Well, they drive themselves most of the time

377
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,300
but, should they need a chauffeur for
evening parties and the like, that'd be you.

378
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,900
I see. Well, I can drive, just about.

379
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,130
- Is that all?
- Do you know how to valet?

380
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,690
Goodness, this is a job
for a one-man band.

381
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,580
You're a delicate-looking
fella, aren't you?

382
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,500
I wouldn't say that.

383
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,210
- Are you married?
- No.

384
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,660
Why would that be? Did the
right girl never come along?

385
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,260
I think you know that not many
footmen or butlers are married.

386
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,820
Well, they didn't used to be. But I am.

387
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,820
All right, Mr Barrow, I've got
enough. We'll let you know.

388
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,980
- How did the visit go? - Well, George
wants to be a pig farmer when he grows up.

389
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,940
- And Mr Drewe's well?
- He's so proud of his animals.

390
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,100
Was Mrs Drewe there?

391
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
You're full of questions.

392
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,700
To be honest, she was quite
upset at seeing Marigold again.

393
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,930
I thought it would be a nice gesture

394
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,010
but, perhaps, I was being insensitive.

395
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,220
When a woman loves a child,
it must stay with her.

396
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,300
I suppose so.

397
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,100
That reminds me...

398
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,900
You know what you told me, last night?

399
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,580
Yes.

400
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,930
I want you to let me help.

401
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,060
That's so nice, milady, thank you,
but there's nothing to be done --

402
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,220
That's not true. Well,
that's not necessarily true.

403
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,700
I think you've forgotten that,
when I was first married,

404
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,330
- I couldn't get pregnant, either --
- Yes, but you see, I --

405
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,290
Listen. So I went to a
Dr Ryder in Harley Street.

406
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,780
He found I needed a tiny operation,
I had it and George is the result.

407
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,140
- I don't think there's any point --
- There's no point in thinking, you don't know.

408
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,380
I'm going to take you up to London, we'll
meet Dr Ryder and listen to what he has to say.

409
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,970
- Then we'll see.
- But what would that cost?

410
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,010
I couldn't accept it from you.

411
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,330
Don't be silly, you've
earned it fair and square,

412
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,140
keeping my secrets, hiding
that fearful Dutch thingamajig,

413
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,920
carrying poor Mr Pamuk down the
gallery in the dead of night.

414
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,850
We have had our moments
haven't we, milady?

415
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,580
We certainly have. And
this is our next moment.

416
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,220
I'll telephone and make an appointment.

417
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I do appreciate it.

418
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,980
It won't work, but that's not the point.

419
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:37,010
Nobody in my whole life has
been kinder to me than you have.

420
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,260
- Except for Mr Bates.
- Except for Mr Bates.

421
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,380
I'm glad that's settled.

422
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,060
- Will you tell him?
- Not yet.

423
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,620
He'd hope too much. But later,
if anything comes of it.

424
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,300
But how? I'd be surprised if Mr Henderson was
particularly anxious to renew our acquaintance.

425
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,650
Couldn't Sir John Darnley
put in a good word?

426
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,140
I'm sure, but the new owners
won't take orders from him.

427
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,210
Now that it is theirs,
they'll do as they think fit.

428
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,370
So I'll tell Daisy not
to speak to you about it.

429
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,780
I don't like anyone to feel they
can't approach me if they want to,

430
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,130
but I'm not convinced I can help.

431
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,900
- Whom can't you help?
- Mr Mason.

432
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,380
- I don't think I can.
- No.

433
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,020
What were you not saying about
your visit to the Drewes'?

434
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,300
Only that Mrs Drewe has
definitely not got over Marigold.

435
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,980
- No? - No. She looked as if
she wanted to swallow her whole.

436
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,970
Well, how clever was it to take the
child there in the first place?

437
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,620
Mary made the plan. There
was no way to cancel it.

438
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,690
I wish Edith would just tell her.

439
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:47,980
Oh, she thinks Mary would use it
as a weapon and she may be right.

440
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,820
If only the Drewes would move
away and find a tenancy elsewhere.

441
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,810
Why would they? They've been at
Yew Tree for more than a century.

442
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,380
That woman will not forget Marigold
while the girl is under her nose.

443
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:03,780
I don't mind talking to Drewe,
but I doubt it will do much good.

444
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,710
- Did the interview go well?
- Not very.

445
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,910
Never mind. Something will turn up.

446
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,590
But not this one.

447
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,560
They wanted me to be a chauffeur,
a footman and a valet combined.

448
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,040
For all I know, I'd have to cook and
do the garden into the bargain (!)

449
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,710
I suppose none of that was
reflected in the money.

450
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,440
Was it heck as like? They pay for
one servant and they want a whole
bleeding household thrown in.

451
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,960
- I don't understand why you bother with him.
- I know you don't.

452
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,870
- So I can't speak to Her Ladyship?
- She didn't say that,

453
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,070
she just said she didn't
think she could help.

454
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,280
I'd like to hear it from her lips, or I'll feel
I've done nothing, except make things worse.

455
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,030
- Well, then, ask her.
- But don't be angry with her.

456
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,670
It's not Her Ladyship's fault.

457
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,950
Maybe not, but it's the system's fault.

458
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,320
That's what makes me angry -- the
system -- and she's part of it.

459
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,040
I do not understand why any
form of compromise is beyond him.

460
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,710
You wanted a strong editor.

461
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,080
But I didn't want to find myself
in a bull ring with Attila the Hun.

462
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Thank you, William.

463
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,000
- Oh... Mary's coming tomorrow.
- What does she want?

464
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
She has an appointment in Harley
Street and she needs some clothes.

465
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,310
I ought to do some
shopping while I'm here.

466
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,190
I haven't had anything new in ages.

467
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,680
- Why not go shopping together?
- With Mary? Not likely.

468
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,430
- That was a delicious dinner.
- Oh, I have a new cook.

469
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,880
She won't stay -- the good ones never do,
but we shall eat well until she goes.

470
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,590
What have you decided
to do about your flat?

471
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,280
I think I'm going to keep it empty
and see if I get any use out of it.

472
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,430
- Why aren't you there now?
- I should be.

473
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,400
I suppose the truth is
I've never lived alone

474
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,790
and I'm not convinced
I'll be much good at it.

475
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,830
Beware of being too good at it.

476
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,480
That's the danger of living alone
-- it can be very hard to give up.

477
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,400
It's not that I'm ungrateful, I am
grateful, I think it's very kind.

478
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,510
But you don't want to accept?

479
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,840
This is a beautiful house

480
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,240
and whether we're in the great hall
or the drawing room, or wherever,

481
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,310
it would all be very splendid.

482
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,320
- So what's the problem?
- It's not us.

483
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,680
It's not who we are.

484
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,710
It may be where we work,
but it is not who we are.

485
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,480
While being in the school house would be?

486
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,470
It doesn't have to be the school
house, if you don't like it.

487
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,400
But, yes, if we take a neutral place
and decorate it the way we want

488
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,560
and put in the flowers we
like, it would be about us

489
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,640
in a way the great hall of
Downton Abbey never can be.

490
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,880
And I have to tell His Lordship.

491
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,160
I will, if you don't want to.

492
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,360
No, no, I'll do it. It should be me.

493
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,430
Do you know when you'll be back?

494
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,470
Tomorrow, or the next day, I expect.

495
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,110
What does she have planned?

496
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,160
Oh, you know, some shopping,
one or two appointments.

497
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,030
Well, try and put your feet up.

498
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,710
Yes, I'll be putting my feet up.

499
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,230
I think a bit of a break will do you good

500
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,760
and give my regards to Mr Mead.

501
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,720
You're right, it may do me good.

502
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,940
It won't do any harm, anyway.

503
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,630
To what do we owe this honour?

504
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,670
I must look in at the church

505
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,360
and I'm seeing Dr Clarkson and
Mama at the hospital later on.

506
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,430
I've mentioned it to Isobel,
so I hope she's there too.

507
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,880
- Is that wise?
- I think so.

508
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,360
At least she's an ally I can rely
on, even if I can't rely on you.

509
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,760
- I didn't tell you about the m - What
time's your train? - Half-past nine.

510
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,720
- Bags of time. - Carson, have
you broken the news to Mrs Hughes?

511
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,960
- What news is this?
- Where they're having the wedding reception.

512
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,040
- I hope she's pleased. - To be honest,
My Lady, she's a little hesitant.

513
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,950
She's not quite convinced
that it would be appropriate.

514
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,640
- Why not? - She feels we would be
making a claim to which we have no right.

515
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,000
Carson, you've worked in this house
man and boy for half a century.

516
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,750
If you've no right to be married
from here, then who does?

517
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,670
- Mrs Hughes sees it differently.
- You leave Mrs Hughes to me.

518
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,760
Don't worry, Carson, your reception will be
in the great hall if it's the last thing I do.

519
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,000
How reassuring, My Lady.

520
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,080
How very reassuring.

521
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:45,000
We wanted you to see the
ward now it's been repainted.

522
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,000
- It's much brighter, isn't it?
- Very nice.

523
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
Doctor?

524
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,830
He's done this with me, my dear.

525
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,870
Now you'll be paraded past
every element of treatment:

526
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,150
surgical, palliative, you name it.

527
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,190
Oh? And what are you trying to add?

528
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,470
I don't want Cousin
Cora to feel outnumbered.

529
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,470
It isn't friendly, you know,
to stir her up into opposition.

530
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,430
It's not very friendly to squash
her into submission either.

531
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,150
Excuse me, but I don't need
to be stirred or squashed.

532
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,790
- The facts speak for themselves.
- Your facts or mine?

533
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,840
- What's the difference?
- Mine are the true facts.

534
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,390
Shall we continue this in my office?

535
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,160
I wish we could persuade you to
help us stem the tide of change.

536
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,680
I'm just not convinced it's the
right way forward, to go backward.

537
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,750
I do not understand you, my dear.

538
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,320
- Are you saying Dr Clarkson is
a bad doctor? - Certainly not.

539
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,840
And the other doctors that use our
hospital -- are they no good either?

540
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm sure everyone does their very best,

541
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,990
but there are new methods now,
new treatments, new machines.

542
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,230
Great advances have
been made since the war.

543
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,190
- Can't we share in them?
- Hear, hear.

544
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,430
Of course. I intend that we should.

545
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,800
- We haven't got the money.
- I see I'm not needed to lend you strength.

546
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,790
You're fully in command of the argument.

547
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,040
Have you no pride in what we
have achieved with our hospital?

548
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,110
I don't think pride comes into it.

549
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,480
Well, I warn you, Dr Clarkson and
I will fight to the last ditch.

550
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,830
I just want what's best for the village.

551
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,870
Well, at least we have that in common.

552
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,560
I must go. Mama, Isobel...

553
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,600
I'll come with you.

554
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,780
We must give them time to
gnash their teeth alone.

555
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,800
I can't deny it, Lady Grantham
would've made a powerful ally.

556
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,160
I hope you're not implying that
she would be more powerful than I.

557
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
- Oh, no, indeed.
- Mm.

558
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,750
- Are you ordering me to leave?
- Of course not,

559
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,390
but the fact remains, this
is a difficult situation.

560
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,600
Why did they bring her here?
Why didn't Lady Edith stop it?

561
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,750
She couldn't, she was away.

562
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,430
Where's Mrs Drewe now?

563
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,670
She's collecting the children from school.

564
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,720
We're all right.

565
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,870
I wish we were all right.

566
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,910
Nobody wishes it more than I do,

567
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,080
but Her Ladyship worries that Mrs Drewe
simply cannot stand being so near the child.

568
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,910
Don't push us out, milord.

569
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,870
We've been here since before Waterloo.

570
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,190
I'm not pushing anyone anywhere.

571
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,760
I want Lady Edith to be happy and
I want Miss Marigold to be happy

572
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,830
and as a matter of fact, I would
like your wife to be happy too.

573
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,960
I can manage her, I promise.

574
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,520
- Very well, if you're sure you can.
- I am sure.

575
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,740
Then we'll leave it at that.

576
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,480
Did you manage to raise the subject?

577
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,550
His Lordship brought it up.

578
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,070
How did he take it when you refused?

579
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,350
Oh. You didn't refuse, did you?

580
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,360
It was difficult.

581
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Lady Mary feels... that it's only right

582
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,990
that my marriage is
celebrated in the house.

583
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,120
And heaven forfend we lowly folk should do
anything to contradict the blessed Lady Mary!

584
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,240
- That's not like you.
- It is very like me.

585
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,360
I want my own wedding to
be done in my own way.

586
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,350
- Is that so outlandish?
- It's my wedding too.

587
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,120
But I am the bride, we'll be doing
it your way for the next 30 years,

588
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,400
I know that well enough,
but the wedding day is mine.

589
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,760
- What is it? - Your Ladyship,
might Daisy have a word with you?

590
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,200
- Now?
- She's just outside.

591
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,080
Very well.

592
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,230
Thank you for seeing me, milady.

593
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,230
I'm happy to, Daisy, but I
must tell you right off,

594
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,680
- there's nothing more I can do.
- I just can't bear it

595
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,240
for our William's dad to be thrown out
of his farm when it's all my fault.

596
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,550
To start with, I don't
think it is your fault.

597
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,040
Mr Henderson was angry, but he
wouldn't change his plans for that

598
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:13,040
and the truth is, they are taking
a lot of the estate in hand.

599
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,760
But Mr Mason's not young and
it needs someone that knows him.

600
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,200
I'm sure he has a fine reputation
and Sir John Darnley will help.

601
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,990
He's got all the dead stock,
with everything in top shape.

602
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,110
Any estate would be lucky to have him.

603
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:28,640
And he'd be happy to start
anew? It's a big undertaking.

604
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,360
Why?

605
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,230
Have you thought of something?

606
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,230
- You've had an idea, haven't you?
- Probably not.

607
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,960
Well, maybe.

608
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,070
I'll let you know if anything comes of it.

609
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

610
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,800
It's no mystery, Mrs Bates, you
suffer from cervical incompetence.

611
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,990
To put it plainly, the
neck of the womb is weak

612
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,230
and as the foetus reaches
three or four months,

613
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,150
it becomes too heavy to be supported.

614
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,070
- So it's not unusual?
- It's bad luck, but not unusual.

615
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,270
- And you can treat it?
- Certainly.

616
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,470
The procedure is called cervical cerclage.

617
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,990
- It's been in use for more
than 20 years. - Go on.

618
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,600
I would insert a stitch, quite a
large one, in the neck of the womb.

619
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,670
- Is it painful?
- It's quite quick.

620
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,880
- But it works? - I'm afraid I
can't make a blanket promise.

621
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,920
It works in many cases.

622
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,870
- And when would you do it?
- At about 12 weeks.

623
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,510
I'd normally come to your
house and perform it there,

624
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,510
then you can rest afterwards
without the nuisance of travel.

625
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,060
- I wouldn't go to hospital?
- Oh, no, it's not worth it.

626
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,720
Well, you've given me a lot
to think about, Doctor.

627
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
Thank you.

628
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,150
- When do you return north?
- In the morning.

629
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,280
Then I leave it to you to get in touch if and
when you next become pregnant, Mrs Bates.

630
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,230
I'm afraid Drewe won't leave.

631
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,270
I can't pretend I really blame him.

632
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,270
But I don't believe the
problem will go away either.

633
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,310
Edith telephoned before I came up.

634
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,520
It seems her editor continues
to be a nightmare too.

635
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,190
Did she say when she's coming back?

636
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,320
She and Mary are catching the
same train tomorrow, 11 o'clock.

637
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,440
Travelling together? Heavens to Betsy!

638
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,790
But I'm glad Mary's coming straight back.

639
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,920
As it is, she'll only have two days
to get the pigs ready for the show.

640
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
Don't worry, it's only a fat stock
show and they're pretty low-key.

641
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,310
Two days is more than enough.

642
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,350
Still, I'm glad she's doing it.

643
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,240
These things remind the farming community
that we're all on the same side.

644
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,680
I wish we could remind your mother
that we're on the same side.

645
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,870
I don't think the rule applies to Mama.

646
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,020
- She's a law unto herself.
- And don't we know it?

647
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,750
Is there more sugar?

648
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,790
Here, pop one in there for us.

649
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Right, as you're all aware, this
is the day of the Malton show.

650
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,750
There'll be no upstairs luncheon

651
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,350
and you're all free to
visit the show if you wish.

652
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,950
The wagonette will leave
from the stable yard at ten.

653
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,440
- Is there a lunch we're serving at?
- No, they're guests of Lord Mexborough.

654
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,310
I don't think I'll bother. It's
only a muddy, little affair.

655
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,230
Oh, no, you should come.
I think it'll be fun.

656
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,590
You're full of the joys of spring.

657
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,710
- Am I?
- I was right about London.

658
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,200
- You've been very bouncy since you
got back. It did you good. - It did.

659
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,030
Now let me get on. I'll see you
down here, just before ten.

660
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,390
- How long can we stay there?
- Good question.

661
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,870
I must have a staff to serve
tea in case they want it.

662
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,830
- I could do that.
- I don't think so.

663
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,040
Andrew, Mr Molesley, make sure
you're here by a quarter-past four.

664
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,790
Then when do you need me, Mr Carson?

665
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
When indeed?

666
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,060
- How are they doing today?
- Fine fettle, milady.

667
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,520
- Moo! - Look at that cow. - Moo!

668
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,120
- You made it, then?
- Did you think I wouldn't?

669
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,830
Oh, they're all here, then.

670
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,150
You knew they would be. Come on.

671
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,120
Never mind. Do you want to see
Lady Mary showing off her pigs?

672
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
In a minute.

673
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,990
Here, let me show you.

674
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,390
Don't worry, Mr Barrow. It's not my game.

675
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,380
I'd better go. I don't
want to miss those pigs.

676
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,550
You're not a quick learner, are you?

677
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,630
I don't know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.

678
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,560
I'm only thinking of you. Just
be sensible, for heaven's sake.

679
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,840
Does it ever occur to you that,
just this once, you might be wrong?

680
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,070
Well done, milady. You look
as if you're born to it.

681
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,560
Not a compliment to everyone's
taste, Mr Finch, but it is to mine.

682
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,430
It's funny to see Lady Mary
in there with the pigs.

683
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,070
I think it does her proud.

684
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,760
I agree. People might think she's
a pretend farmer, but she's not.

685
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,360
- I hope things are beginning to settle
down for you, Mr Mason. - Settle down?

686
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,350
- They're beginning to break
apart, more like. - Don't say it.

687
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,520
Only poor Daisy can hardly work,
she's been so worried about you.

688
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,900
Nae, Daisy, you can't let
worry put you off your work.

689
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,960
Brava. You look very convincing.

690
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,870
- My god-daughter, the pig breeder.
- So good of you to come.

691
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,310
One of my tenants has an
entry, I came to support him,

692
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,350
so you're a bonus, my dear.

693
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,040
Mama says you're on her side
for the battle of the hospitals.

694
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,110
Well, I believe in the changes, yes.

695
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,880
Naturally, Granny blames Isobel for
drawing you over to the dark side.

696
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,710
Oh, no, no, no. I was
on the dark side anyway.

697
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,200
Oh! I was rather hoping it might
be the first signs of a thaw.

698
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,160
How I wish that were true but, I'm
afraid, her mind remains made up.

699
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,080
A woman can always change her mind,
it's what we're known for. Ah...

700
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,080
- Hello, Mrs Drewe. Everyone well?
- Very well, thank you, milord,

701
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,510
but I've left the
children with my neighbour.

702
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,360
- Tim thought I should have a day off
to enjoy myself. - Quite right too.

703
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,080
Nice to see you.

704
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,750
What else would you like to do?

705
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,880
If you're asking, could we get this
business sorted for good and all?

706
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,680
I don't mean to sound stubborn,
but surely it is sorted.

707
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,560
It means a lot to Lady Mary and the
family that we're married in the house

708
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,030
- and I can't see why we shouldn't be.
- You can't?

709
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,640
No, I can't.

710
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,600
If we had family nearby, or a
place that meant something special,
it'd be different, but we don't

711
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,440
and Downton Abbey means much
more to me than the school.

712
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,920
I'm sorry, but it does.

713
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,190
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

714
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,830
- it is time for the announcement
for Best In Show. - Ah!

715
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,240
- First prize goes to Golden
Empress of Downton Abbey. - Oh!

716
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,910
Earned by the Earl of
Grantham and Lady Mary Crawley.

717
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,950
- Very good.
- Pig man -- Mr Timothy Drewe.

718
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
Well done, My Lord.

719
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,550
Yes, well done, us.

720
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,590
Where's Miss Marigold, milady?

721
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,600
She was... Who's got Marigold?

722
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,030
- She was here just...
- No, she's gone.

723
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,030
- I gather we've won.
- Yes, but Miss Marigold's missing.

724
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,880
- What? - Oh, my god. - Don't worry,
she's just wandered off. She's fine.

725
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,110
She'll be perfectly fine, you'll see.

726
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,150
- What is it?
- Marigold's gone.

727
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,560
I was talking to your wife and
Marigold was just in front of us.

728
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,830
How could I possibly
have lost sight of her?

729
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,630
Stay with your mother.
Everyone spread out. Carson!

730
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,270
I'm coming with you.

731
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,190
Barrow, come with me.

732
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,070
- What is it, milady?
- We're missing Miss Marigold.

733
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,150
- Don't say that word.
- Don't be silly.

734
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,940
She's missing now and
soon she'll be found.

735
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,430
- Any luck?
- I'm afraid not, milord.

736
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,480
Barrow...

737
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,520
- Have you got a car here, milady?
- What? No, I came with my parents.

738
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,310
- Why?
- I know where we'll find her.

739
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,560
- Where? - I've just realised Margie's
gone too and she's taken the truck.

740
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,550
- You mean she... - I'm afraid so,
milady, but she won't hurt her.

741
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,800
Whatever she does, she won't hurt
her. Calm them down and let's go.

742
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,240
It's all right, we had a message.

743
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,400
Mrs Drewe found her and has taken
her home to be out of harm's way.

744
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,110
- Could you take me there now
to collect her? - Of course.

745
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
I'll get the car.

746
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,680
- What's going on?
- Panic over, milady.

747
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,550
Miss Marigold's at Yew
Tree Farm with Mrs Drewe.

748
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,120
- They've just gone to fetch her now.
- At the farm with Mrs Drewe? Why?

749
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,990
She took her there for safety.
It was good of her, really.

750
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
And how will we get back?

751
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,190
Please, let me go in alone.

752
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,710
- I'll come.
- No, I don't wanna frighten her.

753
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,100
Let him, he knows what he's doing.

754
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
She was bored.

755
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,080
They were paying her no
attention, none at all.

756
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,060
So you brought her here.

757
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,990
Where else would I bring her?

758
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040
This is her home...

759
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,070
.. and no-one was looking
after her, not one of 'em.

760
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,040
Give her to me now.

761
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,070
You're not angry are you, Tim?

762
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Surely, you can't be angry that
I only want to hold her close

763
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,640
and love her as much as I can.

764
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,000
No, my darling.

765
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,360
I'm not angry at all.

766
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,920
But give her to me...

767
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,480
.. please.

768
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,040
There we are, safe and sound.

769
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:22,440
Hello, darling.

770
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,120
Let's get you back in
the car and off home.

771
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,550
I'll start looking for another
tenancy in the morning.

772
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,190
I am sorry, Drewe.

773
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,230
I want to help as much as I can.

774
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,640
Please, just tell me if there's
anything you need from me.

775
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,350
- That's very kind of you, milord.
- It's not kind.

776
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,000
It's a poor return for what you
and Mrs Drewe have done for us.

777
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,320
- I know how much Lady Edith...
- There you are.

778
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,080
- .. know how much all of us owe to
you and your wife. - Don't feel badly.

779
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,920
We made a plan, Lady Edith and
I, but we forgot about emotion...

780
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,790
.. and emotion's what can
trip you up every time.

781
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,000
God bless you, Drewe.

782
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,070
God bless you and your family.

783
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,080
The same to you, milord.

784
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,160
The very same to you.

785
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,840
He's agreed.

786
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,630
It seems very unfair, but I've
thought and thought about it

787
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,270
and I don't see what else we can do.

788
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,310
I think it's for the best.

789
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,360
I know it's for the best.

1
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,660
- You mustn't make him wait forever.
- I love him.

2
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,030
I'd accept him in a trice
if it weren't for Marigold.

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,160
- You say he'll let you keep her.
- That's not the problem. - What is?

4
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,230
If I stay silent, there's a lie
at the heart of my marriage.

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,150
But if I tell him the
truth, will I ruin it?

6
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,870
Edith, you're a grown woman
and I can't force you.

7
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,350
But you cannot be married to a man and
leave him out of a secret like this.

8
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,800
- It's not possible and you won't be happy.
- How happy am I now?

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,510
Mrs Patmore, you are the owner of
No.3 Orchard Lane, Haughton-le-Skerne.

10
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,030
I am. I'm running it as a
bed-and-breakfast place.

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,390
Among your guests, was a certain
Doctor Fletcher and his wife?

12
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,630
They were my first. Very courteous
and respectable, I must say.

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,830
Not as respectable as you think.

14
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,270
- Dr Fletcher was a Mr Ian McKidd
and his 'wife' a Mrs Dorrit. - What?

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,310
Mr Dorrit is now suing Mr McKidd
for damages related to adultery.

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,640
- You may be called upon to testify.
- Oh, my God.

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,710
There is some concern
Haughton-le-Skerne will be in the news,

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,760
as a site of a house of ill repute.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,670
A house of ill repute?

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,990
I'm afraid the rumour
mill has already begun...

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,830
but there's a chance that
Dorrit may settle out of court.

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,160
- I'll keep you informed.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,910
Hello. What brings you here?

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,390
Oh, Mrs Patmore's the one to ask.

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,960
A house of ill repute?

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,910
Mama is swanning around the South of
France without a word to any of us.

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,750
- I wish Cora --
- I won't hear a word against Cora.

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,230
- Mama is being impossible. - I was going to
say, "I wish Cora wouldn't take it to heart."

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,560
Mama has exhausted my patience this time.

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,840
- But she did give you Teo.
- True. I forgive her everything.

31
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,190
Do you think he will marry Edith?

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,750
If he learns about Marigold?

33
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,270
I just don't want her to be hurt.

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,550
- Is that it, then?
- Yes, let's go.

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,310
- Isn't Bertie's employer
always in Tangiers? - Hmm.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Can you buy one?

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Thank you.

38
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,510
The 6th Marquess of Hexham, 39,
has died on holiday in Tangiers

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,510
where he was a frequent visitor.

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,190
The cause is given as Malaria.
Lord Hexham was unmarried.

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,670
- Does this mean Bertie's out of a job?
- That depends on the heir.

42
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,870
Poor Edith. It was bad enough he was
an agent. Now he may not be that.

43
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,320
Don't sound so gleeful about it.

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,070
- You should have seen her face.
- It wasn't very funny for Mrs Patmore.

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,020
- No. And I'm not laughing, but --
- But, you're laughing.

46
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,470
- How many classes will you be taking
every week? - Five to start with.

47
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,870
Only afternoons between
half-two and half-four.

48
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,240
- What does Mr Carson say?
- I haven't asked him yet.

49
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,270
Don't ask him, tell him.

50
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
But suppose it doesn't work
out? Suppose I'm no good?

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,590
Of course I didn't know
they'd invited you.

52
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,630
- I would have mentioned it.
- Nobody has been as rude to me as your son.

53
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,950
Why in God's name would
he want me at his wedding?

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,910
- Well, isn't it a good sign?
- I'm not sure what it's a sign of.

55
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,310
- Amelia's influence.
- Ah. Yes. I think I agree.

56
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,470
- She is a very kind and gentle soul.
- Is she? Is she, indeed?

57
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,200
- Don't you think so?
- To be honest, I don't know her.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,830
It was all I could do not to
burst out laughing. Poor thing.

59
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,030
Is it funny? Suppose someone makes
a connection between Mrs Patmore

60
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,910
- and her place at Downton Abbey?
- I'm sure they won't.

61
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,710
We should PRAY they don't. I don't
want this story repeated upstairs.

62
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,200
I'm not going to tell them.

63
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,590
Oh, that's the first proper
laugh I've had for ages.

64
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,390
- I couldn't resist telling you.
- Poor Mrs Patmore.

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,840
Oh, I know. It's awful for her.

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,910
I'm going to have to think of
something serious when I go down.

67
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,030
I had some rather sad news when we
were in Thirsk. Lord Hexham's died.

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,630
- Who's that, M'Lady?
- The owner of Brancaster Castle,

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,950
where we all stayed last
year. For the grouse.

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,350
Not me, M'Lady. I was...
otherwise detained.

71
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,670
Oh, of course you were. I am sorry.

72
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,670
Only it might affect Lady
Edith's friend, Mr Pelham.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,710
He's the agent there. Or was.
He might be out of a job.

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,830
How worrying for them.

75
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,230
My romance might not be the only
one to come to an untimely end.

76
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,270
- Have you heard from Mr Talbot?
- No. But that's a good thing.

77
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,310
- It means he's accepted my decision.
- Which is what you want?

78
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,630
Which is exactly what I want.

79
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,550
Oh, I just can't get the
phrase out of my head.

80
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,150
- It just goes round and round.
- A house of ill repute.

81
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,390
Yes, I know what it is, thank you!

82
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,990
Yes, I see.

83
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,470
- Ah, Mr Dawes has got some news for you.
- Do I want to know?

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,880
Read it for yourself.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,270
You passed every paper with high marks.

86
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,790
Oh, Daisy. That's wonderful news.

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,950
Poor Mr Pelham. First that
terrible day at the racetrack,

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,390
- and then to hear his cousin's died.
- It does seem very hard.

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,110
- Did you get hold of him?
- Yes.

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,150
He's coming tomorrow, on the first
leg of his trip to Tangiers.

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,910
- I've asked him here.
- Good.

92
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,350
- How is he? - Sad. He loved his
cousin, and it was all so quick.

93
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,110
The trouble is they've already buried
him and Bertie's not sure what to do.

94
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,070
It's ordinary in hot countries.
It won't mean any disrespect.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,430
No, but, should they leave him there?

96
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,560
Surely the decision is down to
the new Marquess not to Bertie.

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,560
Well, that's the thing. He
is the new Marquess... Bertie.

98
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,670
- Bertie Pelham is now the
Marquess of Hexham? - Yes.

99
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,310
Nonsense. He's having you on. He'd
have told you if he was the heir.

100
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,230
He did tell me. But his
cousin was in his 30s

101
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,430
and they all knew the
girl he was going to marry.

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,670
But that's absurd! If Bertie's
a marquess, then Edith --

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,870
Edith would outrank us
all. Yes. That's right.

104
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,630
- Was he a close relation?
- Second cousin, once removed.

105
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,110
Nobody thought it was possible he
would inherit. Least of all Bertie.

106
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,510
- He seemed like a nice young man to me.
- And getting nicer by the minute.

107
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,760
- With a love of Brancaster.
- Golly gum drops! What a turn-up.

108
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,190
That's dinner.

109
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,780
If we're not too distracted to eat.

110
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,230
- We'll all bow and curtsy to Edith.
You'll enjoy that, Mary. - Hardly(!)

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,910
And if Bertie IS Lord Hexham
which I still don't believe,

112
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,470
- he won't want to marry her now.
- Careful.

113
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,000
People will think you're jealous,
dear. We don't want that.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,630
- It's only a try-out, Mr Carson.
- Every day you'd leave at two?

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,950
And I'd be back by five. So I
could serve dinner and luncheon.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,950
- No lingering over the pudding.
- Mr Barrow is still here --

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,710
- Oh, don't we know it.
- But if lunch does go on a bit,

118
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,310
there's still Andrew and Mr
Barrow and you to see to it.

119
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,590
And what makes you think
you'll be any good?

120
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,190
I don't know exactly. Perhaps
because I want it so much.

121
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,310
There are plenty of little boys
who want to be famous cricketers.

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,590
It's not enough to make them champions.

123
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,640
- I just want to try, Mr Carson.
- And so you shall.

124
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,630
How terrible. Poor Mrs Patmore.

125
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,320
- What an unlikely bawdy house madam.
- Mrs Patmore's secret career.

126
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,320
- We mustn't joke when Bertie's here.
- We'll have long faces, don't worry.

127
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,750
- I had a call from Henry earlier.
- Henry? Why didn't you say?

128
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,870
- I'm saying now.
- How is he?

129
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,230
Mourning Charlie Rogers. Missing you.

130
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,550
You're not to ask him to come here.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,150
- Suppose he just turns up?
- Don't encourage him, Tom. I mean it.

132
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,680
- We'd be wretched long term.
- And you're not wretched now?

133
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,630
- Mary thinks he'll throw me over.
- I don't see why.

134
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,390
It's surely very encouraging he's
coming here on his way to London.

135
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,310
Unless it's to break with me so he
can start afresh. He's not bound.

136
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I haven't accepted him.

137
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,550
- Have you told him about Marigold?
- Not yet.

138
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,070
Make a clean breast of it. Please.

139
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,720
- You'll regret it if you don't.
- With my luck, I'll regret it either way.

140
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
What are you doing?

141
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,110
Oh. Er...

142
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,710
Making time charts and setting
some tests for comprehension.

143
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,990
- Tests? For the village children?
- You're not expecting too much?

144
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,710
- Who wants cocoa? - I think if
you expect a lot, you get a lot.

145
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,430
- No, thank you, Mrs Patmore.
- Good night. - Good night.

146
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,230
- How are you feeling?
- I'm still shaken. I can't deny it.

147
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,310
- Is your poor niece managing?
- I'm going over to see her tomorrow.

148
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
I'll come with you.

149
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,550
A genuine, copper-bottomed marquess
for Edith. Who'd have thought it?

150
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,830
She hasn't accepted him
so he's not obligated.

151
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,350
He wouldn't be coming here
if he'd changed his mind.

152
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,950
If anyone had told me Mary
would hitch up with a mechanic

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,510
and Edith would marry one of
the grandest men in England,

154
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,990
I'd have knocked them down.

155
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,470
- Mary has got rid of her mechanic and
Edith is not married yet. - I know.

156
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,310
But for poor old Edith who couldn't
make her dolls do what she wanted,

157
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,150
- it is rather wonderful.
- There's still Marigold.

158
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,360
She hasn't told him yet and she must if
they're to have any chance of happiness.

159
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,750
I beg you, my darling,

160
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,910
please don't let things be spoiled
for her this time. That's all I ask.

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,160
All?

162
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,720
I think the wood is right the way
it is. We don't need it any larger.

163
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,430
Mary, let me get him up here.

164
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,030
- There's no point. Nothing's changed.
- You've changed.

165
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,230
It's not as easy as that. I find him
very attractive. I like him a lot.

166
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,230
'I find him very attractive. I like
him a lot.' What a load of baloney!

167
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,270
If I'm in love with him, then what's
that? A powerful urge that fades.

168
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,310
Did it fade for you and Matthew?

169
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,710
- We weren't married long enough but
I'm sure it would have done. - I'm not.

170
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,430
Tom, look I don't mean to pull
rank but with people like us,

171
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,070
we need to marry sensibly.

172
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,510
Especially if we're going
to inherit the family show.

173
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,870
It's a way of life that isn't for everyone

174
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,750
and a bad marriage can poison it.

175
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,190
- He's not an orangutan. He knows how it works.
- He wants different things.

176
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,910
What about you and Matthew?
You came from different poles.

177
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,590
- Yes, but we were young and free.
It's difficult the second time. - Why?

178
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,910
Because you know what's at stake.
It's easier to get it wrong.

179
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,150
- I only see a real opportunity for
you to get it right. - Honestly?

180
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,430
- I'm always honest. - Are you? - Why
would you say that for heaven's sake?

181
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,320
One word: Marigold.

182
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,910
It wasn't my secret to tell.

183
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,710
So, it is true. Well, I knew it was.

184
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,990
Never mind Marigold. She won't
make you happy. Henry Talbot will.

185
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,070
Oh, Henry Talbot, Henry Talbot.

186
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,350
You're far more on his
side than you were on mine.

187
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,510
He's the one for you. Trust
me and give him a chance.

188
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,270
No. And if you want to redeem
yourself in my good graces,

189
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,860
you won't give him a chance either.

190
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,070
Where is everybody?

191
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
Mary and Tom are agenting and
Edith's gone to meet Bertie's train.

192
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,310
Are we going to talk about it?

193
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,590
Are we going to sit by and let
this young man's family and future

194
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,590
be put at risk from a scandal
we are hiding from him?

195
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,030
I don't think she has to
tell everybody but I agree.

196
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,390
- She must tell him. Then it's his choice.
- Isn't it up to Edith?

197
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,870
You say that because after
Tony Gillingham had gone,

198
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,870
you thought none of your daughters
would make a worthy marriage.

199
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,750
Now there's a chance and you can't
bring yourself to give it up.

200
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,870
- You haven't got children. You
don't understand these things. - No.

201
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,510
I haven't had children, as
you so kindly remind me,

202
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,150
but I hope I do have a sense of decency.

203
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,670
How long are you planning to stay?
Your cold must have cleared by now.

204
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,040
Don't fight. Nothing's going to
get better by you two falling out.

205
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,590
Hello, Mr Pelham. I mean...

206
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,470
I'm going to stay Mr
Pelham until the service.

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,910
I wish you'd call me Bertie.

208
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,390
- What sort of service will it be?
- Not a funeral.

209
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,550
I've decided not to disturb him.

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,150
I'll fetch his things and settle his debts

211
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,670
and have a service at home to say goodbye.

212
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,830
That sounds like a very good plan.

213
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,430
- I hope you'll allow me to come.
- I want you to come.

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,590
- You remember my sister?
- Of course. Lady Rosamund.

215
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,310
This must be a strange and
unsettling time for you.

216
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,750
I'll say. My mother's cock-a-hoop,
but she doesn't appreciate

217
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,470
- that I was devoted to Cousin Peter.
- I'm sure she does.

218
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,430
Not really. Most people
didn't get the point of him.

219
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,950
He was... so delicate.

220
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,670
But he was as kind to me
as any man has ever been.

221
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,840
Then how pleased he'd be to
know that you're his heir.

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
That's so nice of you.

223
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,590
Goodness. I'm afraid you've made me blub.

224
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,440
Let me take you upstairs to unpack.
Luncheon's not for half an hour.

225
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,480
- And that's the man you want to trick
into marriage? - I'm going for a walk.

226
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,350
I agree. But Robert thinks Edith's
had so little luck in her life.

227
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,720
Oh, I sympathise, of course, but
we both know she's making a mistake.

228
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,950
One thing. Don't forget Mr Pelham
is now the Marquess of Hexham,

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,590
when you address him.

230
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,390
I helped him unpack and he
wishes to remain Mr Pelham

231
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,390
until his cousin's funeral, Mr Carson.

232
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,550
He can call himself Mr
Pelham to his heart's content

233
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,150
but he is Lord Hexham
nevertheless, Mr Bates,

234
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
and we will refer to him as His
Lordship. Good. Time to get started.

235
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,800
- Good news?
- Not exactly.

236
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,870
Thank you for your enquiry but
we wish to combine the roles

237
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,390
of butler, chauffeur and valet,
and you seem overqualified.

238
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,740
But please accept our
best wishes for the future.

239
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,430
- What future?
- Don't be silly.

240
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,150
Of course. That's right. I'm
silly, aren't I? Silly old me.

241
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,320
- No wait.
- Let him go.

242
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,230
What was it about Tangiers that
your cousin enjoyed so much?

243
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,790
Who knows? He used to talk
of going down to the beach

244
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,710
and watching the young
fishermen bring in the nets.

245
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,630
How the setting sun would
make the scene magical

246
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,430
until everything was suddenly
plunged into darkness.

247
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,590
- Goodness. How lyrical.
- He was lyrical. He was an artist.

248
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,030
In his heart, anyway.

249
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,230
I don't think this family can
boast much in the way of artists.

250
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:18,280
Although we did have an aunt
who was quite good at macrame.

251
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,680
So, are you here to settle things
with Edith before you leave?

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,550
Mary, please.

253
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,640
I hope so. I hope we can get things
settled but I mustn't jump the gun.

254
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,510
You've talked of your mother but
what other family do you have?

255
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,870
That's it. My father's dead,
obviously, there are no siblings.

256
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,070
It's just me and Mother.

257
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,430
You were joking when you
said she was cock-a-hoop

258
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,350
but she must feel a certain pride.

259
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,350
I wasn't joking but judge for
yourselves when you meet her.

260
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,910
You talk as if we should be scared.

261
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,310
She makes Mr Squeers look
like Florence Nightingale.

262
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,640
Ladies? Can I have a picture?

263
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
No, you may not.

264
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,030
He's been there all day.

265
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,510
Well, why didn't you telephone
and warn us? You daft ha'porth!

266
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,030
I'm sorry, Auntie Beryl, I
thought you might not come

267
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,390
and I'm going nearly mad here.

268
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,150
- What about the bookings?
- Cancelled. - What?! All of them?

269
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,910
One man wanted compensation.
For the ridicule.

270
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,710
I hope you told him what he could
do with it! I'll give him RIDICULE!

271
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,720
Now, calm down. There's no harm
done so let's go and have some tea.

272
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,390
This is Mr Molesley.

273
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,150
He will be teaching you history
and English literature.

274
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,510
- Make him welcome, please.
- Good afternoon.

275
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,240
Well, I'll leave you to it.

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,440
This term we will explore the years
between the Civil War of 1642 and...

277
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,710
1642 and the Glorious Revolution...

278
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
of 1688.

279
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,070
Almost half a century of
change and social progress.

280
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,350
I hope you will find
it as exciting as I do.

281
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,870
Things have changed for you now.

282
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,750
- You must know that you're quite
free if you want to be. - I don't.

283
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,670
Look, of course things have changed.
I was in line for a quiet life,

284
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,070
farming, sport, bringing
up a family with my wife.

285
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,630
But now I'm to be one of
the kings of the county --

286
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,110
always on parade, representing
the people who look up to me,

287
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,350
fighting for causes, trying oh
so hard not to be disappointing.

288
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,670
Oh, I think you'll make
a very good job of it.

289
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,190
You couldn't ask for a man with
a sounder moral conscience.

290
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,430
The conscience maybe, but what
about the courage? Help me. Please.

291
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,790
But can I help? Am I worthy?

292
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,070
The 7th Marquess of Hexham weds the
daughter of the 5th Earl of Grantham?

293
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,720
What could be more suitable?
Mother will be thrilled.

294
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,510
You talk of her a lot.

295
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,030
She has been an important
figure in my life. I admit it.

296
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,750
- But I don't agree with her about everything.
- Is she very stern?

297
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,760
She certainly believes rank carries
responsibilities. But so do I.

298
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,560
That's why I need you. To help
me live up to my own expectations.

299
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,990
We ought to go in.

300
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,280
Tea will have started and the
children will be down in a minute.

301
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,230
- The husband has been bought off?
- Well, he's settled out of court.

302
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,710
- And you won't have to be a witness?
- So Mr Willis said.

303
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,270
But I've still lost every one of
my bookings. I'm a laughing stock.

304
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,630
- I did wonder about the whole idea
from the beginning. - You did not!

305
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,670
It's exactly what we're planning to do.

306
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,310
Then clearly we're going to
have to be a lot more careful

307
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,710
- than Mrs Patmore, aren't we?
- That's the front door, Mr Carson.

308
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
I'll go.

309
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,790
Punch is terribly fierce.

310
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,790
I don't think he's a good model
for marriage in later life.

311
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,110
Or relations with the law.

312
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,510
- Take that! And that! And that!
- Ouch, you rascal!

313
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,640
- And that's the way to do it!
- Very good!

314
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,190
Er, Mr Talbot.

315
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,190
Hello, Mr Talbot. Mary never
told me you were coming.

316
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,830
- I didn't know he was. - Well, the
thing is, I was driving down from Durham

317
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,150
and I suddenly realised
I'd be passing the gates.

318
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,350
- What were you doing in Durham?
- Oh, I was doing various car things.

319
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,110
We haven't seen you since
that awful day at Brooklands.

320
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,270
- I hope you're coping with it all.
- Well, one doesn't have much choice.

321
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,310
- Did you know about this? - I might
have said if he was coming from Durham,

322
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,910
then he'd be driving quite close.

323
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,710
Don't think I'm amused. I
dislike my hand being forced.

324
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,710
No-one's forcing anything.

325
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,830
- Now you're here, I hope you'll
stay the night at least. - Mary?

326
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,910
- Perhaps Mr Talbot is in a hurry
to get home. - No, no I'm not.

327
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,830
It's settled then. Carson, will
you please tell Mrs Hughes?

328
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,680
And ask someone to unpack for Mr Talbot.

329
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:50,000
- I'm afraid you've missed tea. - Oh,
don't worry about that. - I won't.

330
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,830
Hello, Bertie, I heard about your
cousin. I'm so terribly sorry.

331
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,670
Thank you. I'm on my way out there now,

332
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,870
but I wanted to get things
settled before I go.

333
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,710
- And are they... settled?
- I think so. They will be.

334
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,510
Then I envy you.

335
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,320
I would say Mr Talbot has just
miscalculated rather badly.

336
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:22,710
.. the struggle between the
Monarchy and Parliament.

337
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,350
Oh, right. That's it for today.

338
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,350
Oh yes, er some of you may like
to examine these time charts

339
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,000
that I've drawn up, tomorrow we'll
really begin to make a start.

340
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Would you...?

341
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,630
This is so precisely not
the way to win me over!

342
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,030
- Will you just get off your high horse?
- Why are you interfering?

343
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,910
- I love you and want you to be happy. - Well,
you've got a bloody odd way of showing it!

344
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,750
Well, I take it this is
me you're fighting about?

345
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,910
Yes, it is. And you can dig yourself
out. Because I've had enough.

346
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,520
Oh!

347
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,230
- Have you brought a
dinner jacket? - Yes.

348
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,430
Well, you were very well equipped
to do your 'car things' in Durham.

349
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,870
How many years do you think
it's taken to find someone

350
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,750
I want to spend the rest of my life with?

351
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,470
Living in my family house?
Working to preserve my estate

352
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,750
- and being outranked by your own stepson?
- Oh, I'm tougher than I look.

353
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,750
Oh, Henry, please don't make
this harder than it has to be.

354
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,310
Are you mad? If you're
trying to get rid of me,

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,630
I'm going to make this as
hard and as horrible as I can!

356
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,160
Well you're being extremely unfair!

357
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,240
I wish I knew what we should do.
(I'm tempted to tell him myself.)

358
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,440
You think he's strong enough
to stand out against his mother?

359
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,400
Can't we just leave Edith to
tell him or not, as she sees fit?

360
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,320
Tell him what?

361
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:55,200
That Mr Gregson made Edith his heir.

362
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,640
Some men might not feel
comfortable with that.

363
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,840
Why did you invite Henry to
stay, without asking me first?

364
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,160
Darling, it was half-past five and
the man was in North Yorkshire.

365
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,640
What did you want him to do?
Pitch a tent under a tree?

366
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,800
He must have made a plan
for his journey back.

367
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,120
I doubt he ever went to Durham.
He came up here to see you.

368
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,080
- Who says so?
- The look in his eyes.

369
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:22,440
Not one of you thinks it's a
good idea! A professional driver?

370
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,600
- With nothing to his name?
- Then give him up. - I had.

371
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,640
I did. Until Mama invited
him to make himself at home!

372
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,840
You can't expect us to be rude. The
man's only crime is to love you.

373
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,650
Just send him away! As quick
as you can. For all our sakes.

374
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,400
She's right about one thing. None
of us thinks it's a good idea.

375
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,730
Maybe not. But she's clearly quite
mad about him, whatever she says.

376
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,150
How was it, Mr Molesley? Teaching?

377
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,450
Oh.

378
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,040
It...

379
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,520
- it was, quite a challenge.
- There's always another day.

380
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,050
I know.

381
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:11,010
They've got their coffee upstairs
so I'll make a last check.

382
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,440
How are you getting to Tangiers?
Is there a boat that sails direct?

383
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,360
- Actually I'm flying. For
the first bit, anyway. - What?

384
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,280
- I know. It does seem rather daring.
- I do not envy you.

385
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,360
I don't know. Now the commercial
airlines are starting to operate,

386
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,400
I dare say we'll all be flying
hither and thither before too long.

387
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,520
I rather doubt that.

388
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,560
I like the way Bertie makes no bones
about it. He's here to see you.

389
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,760
I know.

390
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,720
The same could be said of me but
I'm not doing as well as he is.

391
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,280
I hope you know what you are doing.
She's quite a handful you know.

392
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,920
- Who's a handful? - My beloved sister.
- Well, she is beloved by me, anyway.

393
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:54,040
- I like Bertie. I do. But when you
see them together... - Meaning?

394
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,760
If Henry were the new Marquess,

395
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,520
there wouldn't be a woman who
wasn't setting her cap at him.

396
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,800
What about you? Would
you set your cap at him?

397
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,130
- Because if that's why you're not,
shame on you. - Oh, stop lecturing me!

398
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,330
Excuse me.

399
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,610
Mary, wait. Wait!

400
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,840
Look, I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

401
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,720
I thought I could present my
arguments effectively in person,

402
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,320
- clearly I was wrong.
- I can't bear to be manoeuvred.

403
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:30,400
But you see, I think we
love each other very much.

404
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,550
For some reason, you're
fighting it. I'm not.

405
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,960
My birth is respectable,
so it can't be that,

406
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,080
which forces me to believe
that it is my lack of money

407
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,960
and position that present the problem.

408
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,360
- Aren't you better than that?
- What?

409
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,720
Well, it just seems rather small to me.

410
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,400
Not to marry a man for lack of money

411
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:55,880
- is the same as marrying him because of
it. - Out of my way! - Am I not right?

412
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:58,720
No. You push in here,
into my home, uninvited,

413
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,680
in order to call me a grubby, little
gold digger? You've got a nerve!

414
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,050
Mary!

415
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,410
Mary!

416
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,920
She loves him but she can't control him.

417
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,680
That's what frightens her. He's
stronger than she is, really.

418
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,320
Or as strong. And she's not used to it.

419
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:30,970
She's a bit of a bully, your
Lady Mary. She likes her own way.

420
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:37,520
She is and she does but there's
another side to her. He sees that.

421
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,770
- So you were wrong about him?
- I think I was.

422
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:48,850
- Why are you smiling? - Show me a man that
doesn't smile when his wife admits she's wrong.

423
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,800
- Won't you send me to bed happy?
- Sounds like an indecent proposal.

424
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:09,400
I meant, give me your answer.

425
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:15,290
Let me go to Tangiers with a sense
my tomorrows are beginning. Please.

426
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:22,200
I love you, Bertie.
I've been in love before.

427
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,960
I won't pretend that I haven't.
But I really do love you.

428
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,160
Then I'll take that as a yes.

429
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:34,560
The trouble is, I'm not
as simple as I used to be.

430
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,750
My life is not as simple.

431
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,920
I... just need to be
sure I'm being realistic,

432
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,080
not living in a fool's paradise
and dragging you into it with me.

433
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,400
I'll still take it as a yes.

434
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,600
- You're down early. - No, I'm
not. Where's Henry? - He's gone.

435
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,570
- What? - He had something in London
this evening and wanted to get back.

436
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,570
I have a mass of letters to write.

437
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,800
- I'm sorry Lord Grantham's left.
- Why particularly?

438
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,810
Because we've got some news and I
was waiting for Mary to join us.

439
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,190
It's not the right moment.

440
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,330
Carson, could we have
some more coffee, please?

441
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,600
Why isn't it the right moment?

442
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,440
- Well, Henry's abandoned you.
- No, he hasn't. I wanted him to go.

443
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,120
- That's not what it looked like.
- Well, that's how it is.

444
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,240
There's no need for this.

445
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,560
Edith, if your news is good, then
we are very happy for you both.

446
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,010
Aren't we, Mary?

447
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,520
See? I told you.

448
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:23,160
The one thing Mary can't bear
is when things are going better

449
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,880
- for me than for her.
- I'm sure that's not true.

450
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,400
You don't know her. I'm getting
married and you've lost your man.

451
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,440
And you just can't stand it.

452
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,240
- Edith, there is no need for --
- You're wrong. I'm very happy for you.

453
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,840
And I admire you, Bertie. Not
everyone would accept Edith's past.

454
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,880
- Mary, don't. - What do you mean?
- Well, you must've told him?

455
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,280
You couldn't accept him
without telling him?

456
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,010
- Tell me what?
- About Marigold. Who she really is.

457
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:58,170
Marigold is my daughter.

458
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,290
Will you excuse me?

459
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,480
I beg your pardon, Your
Ladyship, but Mr Pelham, that is,

460
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:35,640
Lord Hexham, has asked for a
taxi and Mr Carson has gone out,

461
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:38,800
- so I'm not quite sure --
- What? Lord Hexham's leaving?

462
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,080
Obviously, if he wants a
taxi. What's happened?

463
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,760
Where's Lady Edith? Can't she
drive him to the station?

464
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,640
- Don't bother about it, Mrs Hughes.
I'll sort it out. - Very good, M'Lord.

465
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,290
- Mrs Hughes, how is Mrs Patmore?
- She's still very upset, M'Lady.

466
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,120
But there's nothing to be done.

467
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,480
- Is this about her B & B going
down the drain? - Don't be flippant.

468
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,960
Why don't we pay her a visit? Have
tea there and let people see us.

469
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,880
What a good idea! Why
didn't I think of that?

470
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:07,640
But if it's to be effective, won't
we have to be in the papers?

471
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,080
Well, the local papers. And it
wouldn't be a news story any more

472
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,400
- than being photographed at a flower show.
- Would Mrs Patmore agree?

473
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,250
- I think she'd be bowled over, Your Ladyship.
- Then it's settled.

474
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,720
I hope you don't mind my saying
that you seem very suspicious.

475
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,400
Do I? But you must admit, your
attitude is quite a volte-face.

476
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,480
I want Larry's father to be
content. Is that a volte-face?

477
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:38,000
But does your fiance want his Papa
to be content in this way? With me?

478
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,200
Well, you know men.

479
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,160
I'm not sure I do, as it
happens. Tell me about them.

480
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,160
I only meant they dig
themselves into a position,

481
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,600
often before considering all the options.

482
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,640
- And you've considered 'the options'?
- I believe so.

483
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,400
Here's another option for you.

484
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,760
I won't rekindle Lord Merton's
dreams unless I'm invited to do so

485
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,160
by Larry Grey, himself. Is that clear?

486
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,880
I speak for him.

487
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:12,560
Yes, but you see, I don't
want you to speak FOR him.

488
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,280
I want to hear him speak for himself.

489
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:21,960
Oh, I see. The plan is to mix up His
Lordship or, worse, Her Ladyship,

490
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,400
with a divorce petition and
the scene of an adultery?

491
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,200
But I want to bury that story and I
need a big event to bury it under.

492
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,760
You have no qualms about dragging
the family we serve into the mud?

493
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,480
It's their choice, Mr Carson.
They're all grown people, surely?

494
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,640
Well, I've always known
that women were ruthless,

495
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,210
but I didn't think I'd find
the proof in my own wife!

496
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:52,560
And there's me thinking how kind
they were to come to the rescue.

497
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,970
And so they are. Just tell
them yes and arrange the day.

498
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,640
- He'll miss his train.
- Let him miss it.

499
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,440
He can catch the next one. What happened?

500
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,120
Mary thought Edith had
told him about Marigold.

501
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:09,560
- How did Mary find out?
- Mary is not stupid.

502
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:14,360
No. And she's not always kind,
either. Was it really a mistake?

503
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,800
What difference does it make?

504
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,280
I'm not shocked exactly. It
isn't that. I promise you.

505
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,280
You have to protect the honour
of your family. Of course you do.

506
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,330
It isn't even that.

507
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,560
You should have told me the
whole story from the beginning.

508
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,760
- You haven't been fair to me.
- No. I don't believe I have.

509
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:42,090
- Then why didn't you?
- I suppose I thought it might ruin everything.

510
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,970
- You mean you didn't trust me?
- I can't have, can I?

511
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,800
Would you have married me in a lie?

512
00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:01,440
I don't think so, but
we'll never know now.

513
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,170
No.

514
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,010
You see, I don't feel I could spend
my life with someone I don't trust.

515
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,650
- Who didn't trust me.
Do you understand? - Yes.

516
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,410
I'm terribly sorry, of course, but
that doesn't mean much, does it?

517
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:28,640
The truth is, my life was
about to be perfectly wonderful

518
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,210
and now I've thrown it all away.

519
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:46,280
- I'd better go if I'm to
catch my train. - Yes, hurry.

520
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,160
I doubt we'll meet again
so I want to say good luck,

521
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,600
and everything else that goes with it.

522
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,170
Good luck to you, too.

523
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,050
I mean that.

524
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,260
Well, you got what you wanted!
Bertie has left for the train

525
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,740
and Edith won't be the
next Marchioness of Hexham!

526
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:32,500
- Well, that's not what I wanted.
- Isn't it?

527
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,820
I still can't believe she'd never
told him. How was I to know that?

528
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:38,820
- Don't play the innocent with me.
- I didn't mean it.

529
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:43,180
Don't lie! Not to me! You
can't stop ruining things!

530
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,100
For Edith, for yourself! You'd
pull in the sky if you could!

531
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,940
ANYTHING to make you feel
less frightened and alone!

532
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,220
You saw Henry when he was here --
high-handed, bullying, unapologetic.

533
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,780
Am I expected to lower myself to his level

534
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,740
and be grateful I'm allowed to do so?

535
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,260
Listen to yourself. 'Lower
yourself to his level'.

536
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,500
You're not a princess in
The Prisoner of Zenda!

537
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,820
- You don't want to understand me.
- You ruined Edith's life today!

538
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,420
How many lives are you going to
wreck just to smother your misery?

539
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,870
- I REFUSE to listen!
- You're a coward, Mary.

540
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,430
Like all bullies, you're a coward.

541
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,100
What are you doing up here?

542
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:33,100
Looking for you to borrow some
scissors but you're going out.

543
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,220
I've left my workbox downstairs
but you're welcome to take them.

544
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,940
Where are you off to?

545
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,550
I said I'd walk with Mr Molesley to
the schoolhouse. For moral support.

546
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,790
- Are you all right, Mr Barrow?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

547
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,620
- Going away?
- Do you care?

548
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,100
Look, I wasn't to know you hadn't
told him. It never occurred to me --

549
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:36,740
Just shut up! I don't
know what's happened.

550
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,380
Tom has made you feel bad, or Papa,

551
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,700
or maybe it's just the same old
Mary who wants her cake and ha'penny!

552
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,460
- I never meant to --
- Yes, you did!

553
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,020
Who do you think you're
talking to? Mama? Your maid?

554
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,620
I know you!

555
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,500
I know you to be a nasty,
jealous, scheming bitch!

556
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,650
- Now listen, you pathetic --
- You're a bitch!

557
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:04,340
Not content with ruining your own
life, you're determined to ruin mine!

558
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:09,300
I have not ruined my life and if
Bertie's put off by that, then --

559
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:13,270
Don't demean yourself by trying
to justify your venom. Just go.

560
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,820
And you're wrong as you so often
are. Henry's perfect for you.

561
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,220
You're just too stupid
and stuck up to see it!

562
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,900
Still at least he's got away from you.

563
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,250
Which is something to
give thanks for, I suppose!

564
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,380
I beg your pardon, M'Lord but Mrs
Patmore has something to say.

565
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,750
- I wonder if now would be convenient.
- Of course. Bring her in.

566
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,460
- How can we help, Mrs Patmore?
- Well, that's just it, M'Lord.

567
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,100
I know you're planning to help
by coming over to the cottage

568
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:04,580
for some tea but should
you be mixed up in it?

569
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,620
- It's my mess, why should
you pay for it? - Indeed.

570
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,860
- Carson? Is this what you believe?
- It is, Your Ladyship.

571
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:17,510
I wouldn't like to see this family
dragged into a tawdry, local brouhaha.

572
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,540
He means me.

573
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:24,580
- Oh, I think we have to show a little
more backbone than that. - My Lord?

574
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,220
Mrs Patmore has been loyal to this house
and this house must be loyal to her.

575
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:31,180
She had made a large
investment in her future.

576
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,900
We can't let it fall away to nothing.

577
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,190
- I'll go now, if I may.
- We'll see you on Friday.

578
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:49,430
- Are you sure, My Lord?
- QUITE sure, thank you, Carson.

579
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,380
You mustn't be nervous.

580
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,020
You don't know what they're like.
I felt like a fraud yesterday.

581
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,940
And all the time I kept
wondering, "What would they say

582
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,860
if they found out that I was
a servant at the big house?"

583
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,220
What would their parents say?

584
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,790
Why not tell them? Then they won't
have to find out, will they?

585
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:17,070
- Mr Barrow's in a funny mood.
- Why?

586
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,860
He suddenly told me out of the blue
he hoped I'd make more of my life

587
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,110
than he'd ever make of his.

588
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,470
- I should go back. - Is
something wrong? - I hope not.

589
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,060
- You're on the men's side!
- Never mind that.

590
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,820
- Have you seen Mr Barrow?
- Er, he was going in for a bath.

591
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,710
Oh, my God! Come with me!

592
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,540
Hello! Mr Barrow! Are you in there?

593
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:08,180
Will you open this door?

594
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:10,110
Get back!

595
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,380
- Oh, my God!
- Fetch Mrs Hughes.

596
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,510
Send Anna for the doctor but tell
no-one else what you've seen.

597
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,340
- I wish I'd gone with them now.
- With who?

598
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,780
- Mr Molesley and Miss Baxter.
- Well, go then.

599
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,020
- I can manage.
- I'll be too late, though, won't I?

600
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,060
You should still go if
you want to. For a walk.

601
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,050
They might have a break
when you get there.

602
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:43,750
- Where's Mrs Hughes and Anna?
- Mrs Hughes is in her sitting room.

603
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,780
- Are you in a rush?
- Not particularly.

604
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:06,140
- Why? - I need you to come
with me to the station.

605
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,660
- Then you can drive the car home.
- Where are you going? - Up to London.

606
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:14,500
I haven't said goodbye to anyone
and I can't bear to look at Mary.

607
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,700
- She's unhappy. I think she regrets
what she did. - Not as much as I do.

608
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,140
And, for your information,
before I left we had the row

609
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,420
we all knew was coming.

610
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:29,940
I'm not sorry. At least I'm just
sorry we didn't have it years ago.

611
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,980
Bertie may come round.

612
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,340
I don't think so. He might
have come round about Marigold.

613
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,860
In fact, I'm sure he would've done.

614
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,540
But I tried to trick him and
he won't come round about that.

615
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:47,110
- Would you like me to talk to him?
- No, but I love you for asking.

616
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,790
We should get going.

617
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:11,300
Anna's gone for Doctor Clarkson.

618
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,340
Now, we should get him into
bed and out of his wet things.

619
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,460
I hope he won't mind if we undress him.

620
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,260
He's past minding if we put him
in a shy and threw coconuts.

621
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,610
Now you take his feet and
we'll take an arm each.

622
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,060
- Should we tell His Lordship?
- Mr Carson's seeing to that.

623
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,850
Right. Here goes.

624
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,030
- I hate to think he was so unhappy.
- At least it's not gone too far.

625
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,510
Why should you?

626
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,540
.. and maybe one of you will run
the country one day. How about that?

627
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,220
That's daft, sir. Only
toffs run the country.

628
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:07,340
No, you see, you must never
think that education is only

629
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:12,140
for special people, you know,
for clever people, for toffs.

630
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,580
- Education is for everyone.
- You would say that, sir.

631
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,220
- Yes, I would. But I'm not anyone special.
- You're a teacher.

632
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,940
I'm a teacher now. But
I'm an ordinary bloke.

633
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,460
I've spent my life in
service, fetching and carrying.

634
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:31,100
- You were a servant?
- I was. I am. And I was glad to get the work.

635
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:35,340
My mum's in service. She works
for Mr Travis at the vicarage.

636
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:38,100
Dad's a gardener at Skelton Park.

637
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,180
But I never gave up on
learning, do you see?

638
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:44,740
I read as much as I could
and I taught myself,

639
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,140
and I hope to be able to teach you.

640
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,790
Maybe give you the shortcut
that I never had...

641
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:03,500
Right. The Civil War. Let's start
with the Divine Right of Kings.

642
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,980
Did King Charles really believe
that he had a Divine Right to rule?

643
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:12,100
Or did he just choose to believe
it because it suited him?

644
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,860
- You mean the King was a liar?
- Er. Not quite.

645
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:19,910
Kings are like anyone else.

646
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,300
Anna says Edith's gone to London
and I suppose we all know why.

647
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,180
- Do we have to do this now?
- Yes, I really think --

648
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,340
Carson, what's happened?
Where are the footmen?

649
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,660
That is something I need to
discuss with you, My Lord.

650
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,340
Thomas has cut his wrists?

651
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,540
- Yes, I'm afraid so, My Lord.
- God in Heaven. Who knows?

652
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,940
Not many and I should
like to keep it that way.

653
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,260
- I shall say that he is ill
with influenza. - Carson...

654
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:55,310
- please don't bother with serving our tea.
- With your permission, My Lady.

655
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:05,750
How sad. How very sad.

656
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:15,670
Do you still think dismissing
Barrow was a useful saving, Papa?

657
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,590
That's rather below the
belt, even for you.

658
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,980
Look, we've kept him out of the hospital.

659
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:31,100
Dr Clarkson stitched him up here. He
says Miss Baxter found him in time.

660
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,150
I'll go up in a minute.

661
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,420
I saw Doctor Clarkson leaving when
I got back. What was he doing here?

662
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,620
Mr Barrow has been taken poorly.
He will spend a day or two in bed.

663
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,630
Anna and Miss Baxter will look after him.

664
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:54,180
- How was it, Mr Molesley?
- Oh. I enjoyed myself today.

665
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,540
- The children were generous to me.
- The children were spellbound.

666
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,340
- How do you know?
- Because I crept in and listened.

667
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:03,330
- You never.
- I did. And you're a natural.

668
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,500
So, are we to lose you to the
groves of academe, Mr Molesley?

669
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:15,180
Can I teach a little while longer
before I re-order my world, Mr Carson?

670
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,460
I'm glad, though. You're
a kind man, Mr Molesley.

671
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,010
It's about time you were
rewarded for your kindness.

672
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,780
He'll recover, M'Lady. And he
hasn't had to go to hospital.

673
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,230
- Can we keep it quiet? For his sake.
- That's what Mr Carson wants.

674
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,860
What a day. I ruin Lady Edith's
life and Barrow tries to end his.

675
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,300
- How is Lady Edith?
- She's gone to London.

676
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,260
Which is hardly to be wondered at,

677
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,340
when her only sister has wrecked her
chances of a happy, fulfilling life.

678
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:53,750
- Lord Hexham won't come round?
- Lady Edith thinks not. And I'm sorry.

679
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:02,300
What about you? Have you thought
any more about Mr Talbot?

680
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,180
Don't you start. You're
as bad as Mr Branson.

681
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:09,860
- Why? What's he done?
- He asked Mr Talbot to come here

682
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:15,260
and he keeps going on and on and on.
But Mr Talbot's not right for me.

683
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:20,310
- He's not. We'd be miserable. - As long
as you're sure that you -- - I am sure!

684
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:24,460
I apologise.

685
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:30,060
It's just nobody can believe
that I know my own mind.

686
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,310
Of course, M'Lady.

687
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,990
- Right. Can I do anything more for you?
- No, thank you.

688
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:50,230
Good night. And Anna...

689
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,310
.. I'm sorry.

690
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,990
- You don't know that's the end.
- Yes, I do.

691
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,030
And please don't think badly of him.

692
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:19,100
- It was my own fault.
- Well, I liked him. - Me, too.

693
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,070
Your sister hasn't been helpful.

694
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:28,820
Mary and I are locked into a kind of
lifelong struggle and I don't know,

695
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,860
it's hard for an outsider to
understand. It's hard for me.

696
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,820
Who invented families?
That's what I'd like to know.

697
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:38,140
- What time is Miss Jones coming today?
- Five. For tea.

698
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,180
Do we know her real name yet?

699
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,300
She only writes as Cassandra Jones
which is the name on her account.

700
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,540
Perhaps it is her real name, after all.

701
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:50,620
Well, real or not, she has quite a
following. So we'd better be pals.

702
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,780
- How did you get her to come here?
- I'm afraid I forced her.

703
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,060
Look, she wants more money
which is fair enough

704
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,340
given the success of the column, but
I insisted we negotiate in person.

705
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:03,820
- Why?
- I was curious. Aren't you?

706
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,140
Suppose she sends someone
to impersonate her,

707
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,180
if she's as secretive as all that?

708
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,660
Let's have a sign if we think
it's the real Cassandra.

709
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,460
Say, "Bananas" if you think
she's telling the truth.

710
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,750
All right. Bananas it is.

711
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:27,940
May we come in?

712
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:33,940
Hello, Mr Barrow. Here you
are. To make you feel better.

713
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:39,340
- Thank you very much, Master George.
- We want you to get better, Barrow.

714
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:43,380
Truly. And no-one more than Master George.

715
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,940
- At least I've got one friend, eh?
- Have you been lonely?

716
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:52,100
If I have, I've only myself to
blame. I've done and said things.

717
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:58,940
I don't know why, I can't stop
myself. Now I'm paying the price.

718
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:02,220
Strange. I could say the same.

719
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,900
- Mr Carson's told them that
you've got -- - 'Flu. I know.

720
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,260
I beg your pardon, M'Lady.

721
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:15,180
We're going Barrow and I hope
things improve for you. I really do.

722
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,140
I'd say the same if it
weren't impertinent, M'Lady.

723
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:21,950
- Goodbye, Mr Barrow.
- Goodbye, Master George.

724
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,460
- So. Today's the big day.
- Oh, spare me.

725
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,020
- Do you want to take Daisy with you?
- Oh, if I'm allowed.

726
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:36,540
I mean my niece is good but
she might be dumbstruck

727
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:39,100
with those Lords and Ladies
sitting in my front room.

728
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,060
Come to think of it, how will the
village know that they've been?

729
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:45,820
Lucy's seen to that. We've got the
man from The Echo coming at five.

730
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:48,100
Oh? Put up a poster, why don't you?

731
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,060
They're doing something nice,
Mr Carson. Don't spoil it.

732
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,460
Yes. Very nice (!) For the public
to read about the cakes and dainties

733
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,580
His Lordship is guzzling as he
sits at the adulterers' table!

734
00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:02,420
I'm sure there've been a few
adulterers sat at the table upstairs.

735
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:04,620
- That is different.
- Why?

736
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,820
To say nothing of suicidal footman
in the attic! What are we coming to?

737
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:13,190
I only thank God that the Dowager
isn't here to witness it.

738
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,740
- I can't believe you came.
- You made it sound so urgent.

739
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,900
Even so, I really
appreciate it. Thank you.

740
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:44,860
- Was everything all right when you got home?
- Well no, not really.

741
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,140
- Spratt has gone away.
- Did you tell him you were coming back?

742
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,780
A good butler should not need to be told.

743
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:55,900
Now, where are they? My
broken-hearted granddaughters?

744
00:54:55,950 --> 00:54:59,180
It's just Mary. Edith's gone up to
London. I didn't know when I wrote.

745
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,230
All the better.

746
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,060
But how will we get it all there?

747
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,540
They're letting me have a car. Seeing
as I'm giving tea to His Lordship.

748
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:12,500
You're ready, then? They've
brought the car round.

749
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,550
Andrew, carry that out.

750
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:22,700
- And very, very good luck.
- And good luck to us all(!)

751
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,820
In the vain hope that we'll
avoid scandalous gossip.

752
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,820
- You're such an old curmudgeon.
- Don't say you're going off me.

753
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:35,710
No, because you're MY curmudgeon
and that makes all the difference.

754
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,150
Hm.

755
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,620
Granny. When did you arrive?

756
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,540
Yesterday evening. I spent the
night before in Southampton

757
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:54,860
and an entire day on trains.
So I've come hot foot.

758
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:58,060
If you're here to reprimand
me about Edith, please don't.

759
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:00,420
Tom's already torn me into strips.

760
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:04,380
- Why did you do it?
- I don't know. She was so...

761
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:07,380
- Anyway, I'm sorry now.
- You should be.

762
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,780
With Edith, I just say things
and then they can't be unsaid.

763
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:15,340
Tom believes you're unhappy.
That's why you lash out as you do.

764
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:18,780
Look, if this is about Henry
Talbot, you should be clear

765
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:23,980
he hasn't much to offer. Bertie
Hexham is a loss but not Henry.

766
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,420
He's well born, but there's
no money or position.

767
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:31,300
He's not even a countryman. Not
really. He grew up in London.

768
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:35,580
- He shoots. - Yes, he shoots. Like
every social-climbing banker shoots.

769
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:39,700
Well, let's leave his credentials
to one side for a moment

770
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:43,380
- and concentrate on what
is important. - Which is?

771
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:47,820
Tom says that he is in love with you
and that you are in love with him.

772
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:51,270
- Do you believe him?
- Do you deny it?

773
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,620
Oh, for you of all people to talk as
if his qualifications don't matter!

774
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:02,990
Tony Gillingham had all that I could
wish -- birth, money, looks...

775
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:06,820
- .. but he didn't suit you.
- No.

776
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,660
He wasn't clever enough.
He wasn't strong enough.

777
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,340
Henry Talbot is both.

778
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,060
All right, Granny, it's not his poverty.

779
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:20,740
But did Tom tell you, I stood
there staring at a car in flames,

780
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:24,020
- wondering if it were him?
- I think he's told me everything.

781
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:28,500
Then you'll know I can't be
a crash widow again. I can't!

782
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:32,540
I'd live in terror, dreading every
race, every practice, every trial.

783
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:35,380
- I cannot do it!
- Does he know this?

784
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:39,390
He'd feel he should give it up but
I don't want that. He'd resent me.

785
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,460
Oh, can't you find me some
Duke? There must be one spare.

786
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,100
So I can put Edith in her place.

787
00:57:45,150 --> 00:57:48,980
You are the only woman I know who likes

788
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:54,540
to think herself cold
and selfish and grand.

789
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:57,060
Most of us spend our
lives trying to hide it.

790
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:02,220
- Oh, Granny please don't lecture me
on sentimental virtues. - Don't worry.

791
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:07,820
Don't worry. I believe in rules and
traditions and playing our part.

792
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,900
But there is something else.

793
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,940
And what is that, pray?

794
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,910
I believe in love.

795
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:23,070
I mean, brilliant careers, rich
lives, are seldom led without...

796
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,390
.. just an element of love.

797
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,390
Oh, Granny. You do surprise me.

798
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:37,380
Oh, I am glad. So climbing all
those stairs wasn't wasted.

799
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,110
No, I would only say this.

800
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:48,070
First, make peace with your sister.

801
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:55,470
And then make peace with yourself.

802
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,590
Oh, Mary.

803
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:08,620
- Is Granny coming back for dinner?
- She didn't say so.

804
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,700
She goes without telling us.
And returns without seeing us.

805
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,220
We're in the dog house. How hard is
that to understand? Now, let's go.

806
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:18,540
- Sure you don't want to come with us?
- Quite sure.

807
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:21,140
You don't need me. You're
enough of a headline.

808
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,590
And you certainly don't need me.

809
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:28,260
- My Lord, I wonder if I might
have a word? - What is it?

810
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,740
With your permission, I'd like
to tell Mr Barrow that he can stay

811
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,900
for the time being at any rate. It
would take a weight off his mind.

812
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,340
That's a relief. I was going
to suggest the same thing.

813
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:43,220
- Were you, My Lord? - Yes. I feel
quite as guilty as you do, Carson.

814
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:47,900
I tell you what I blame myself for.
I didn't credit him with feelings.

815
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:51,460
I thought he was a man without
a heart. And I was wrong.

816
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:54,670
No man is an island, Carson.
Not even Thomas Barrow.

817
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:04,020
I ought to be very angry with you.
Summoning Granny to tick me off.

818
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,060
I was amazed she came at my call.

819
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,100
She said your letter was very
eloquent. She was quite persuaded.

820
01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:14,660
- So what are you going to do?
- As soon as Granny left I sent Henry

821
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:16,900
a telegram to get the next train.

822
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,020
- Hopefully he'll be here by tea time.
- What about Edith?

823
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:24,780
That's a harder task. I'm
ready to say I'm sorry.

824
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,500
But why should she want to forgive me?

825
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,300
- I got held up. Is she here yet?
- Miss Jones has arrived, yes, Lady Edith.

826
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:37,450
- Why the mysterious face?
- You better go in.

827
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:40,820
Ah. Edith.

828
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:44,310
So this, it turns out,
is Miss Cassandra Jones.

829
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:48,110
- Spratt?
- Good afternoon, Lady Edith.

830
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,270
Bananas!

831
01:01:08,150 --> 01:01:11,540
I don't have to tell you why I'm here.

832
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:15,950
Either you know everything
or you're not hearing me now.

833
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,830
The truth is... I love him.

834
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:30,540
I believe we are right together

835
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,660
but I so very much want to feel

836
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:40,110
that you're happy for me, as I'd
be happy for you, my darling.

837
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:47,670
Remember, however much I love him...

838
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,150
I will always love you.

839
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:29,140
- I often come at this time.
- I don't come often enough.

840
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,330
No, no. It's only a habit.

841
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:35,780
Actually, I came to ask
for his forgiveness,

842
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,700
if that doesn't sound too silly.

843
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:44,310
I see. I think that means
you want to marry again.

844
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:50,170
Well, I don't know if you
have his forgiveness...

845
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,990
.. but you don't need to
ask for mine. I'm delighted.

846
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,540
- Anything else I can get you?
- One more mouthful and we'd explode.

847
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,460
Unless there's another
of those delicious scones.

848
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:08,820
Of course. Lucy, fetch the scones.

849
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:12,700
- When does the photographer arrive?
- Five o'clock, M'Lady.

850
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,380
I'm afraid some of the village have
caught on and they're waiting too.

851
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:21,590
- Are you sure you want to do it?
- Oh, ye of little faith.

852
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:35,550
- That's it. I'll leave you to it.
- You don't have to go, Tom.

853
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:41,860
Believe me, I've been part of this
courtship for quite long enough.

854
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,590
It's for you to manage from here.

855
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,140
- Well?
- Well what?

856
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:00,460
Mary, the last time I saw you, you
threw me out for saying I loved you.

857
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:03,260
Now you've whistled and I'm
here, but I don't know why.

858
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,980
Because you were right. Because
we are in love with each other.

859
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,780
I'm not sure why I fought it but
I've stopped fighting it now.

860
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:14,260
I know I'm not what you were looking for.

861
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:17,740
Tom and I once talked about
how marriage should be equal.

862
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:21,820
It has nothing to do
with position or money,

863
01:04:21,870 --> 01:04:26,830
simply that a couple should be
equal in both strength and passion.

864
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:31,660
Should I ring for more tea?

865
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,940
Are you always so cool and
collected? I do hope so.

866
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:36,620
I'm not sure what you mean.

867
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:38,980
Your words have made my
heart pound at such a rate

868
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,100
I'm surprised you can't hear it.
I'm hot, cold and can't breathe.

869
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:45,950
- All because of you. - I must say,
you carry it off well. - Thanks.

870
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:49,660
I need to know that you're certain.

871
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:54,500
I am. I believe I've met my match. I have.

872
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:56,900
I'm not 20, trembling at
the touch of your hand,

873
01:04:56,950 --> 01:05:00,700
but I know that if I leave
you now I'll never be as happy

874
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,420
as we could've been together.

875
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:07,380
I'm not 20 either but I still
tremble at the touch of your hands.

876
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:12,790
- Me, too. I don't know why I said that.
- Oh, darling. Thank God for you.

877
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,940
- So what do we do now? Elope to Gretna Green?
- Well, I have a confession.

878
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:24,100
When I came here last I brought a
licence so we could marry at once.

879
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:26,540
Doesn't the Archbishop of
Canterbury need to agree?

880
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,900
- Not if you can specify the Church.
- Well, you still need a bishop.

881
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,580
- My uncle's a bishop. - Oh? Good old
England. Some things never change.

882
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:39,260
But the point is, it's still valid
so shall we get married now?

883
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,780
- Now?
- Well, on Saturday.

884
01:05:41,830 --> 01:05:45,340
You don't want to have a huge
society affair again, do you?

885
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:48,820
- God, no. I've done that.
- Then will you?

886
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:53,350
Hmm. Well, I suppose I've come this far.

887
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:07,550
Give it a moment, Mr Molesley.
Better give it a moment.

888
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:17,620
If you're ready, My Lord. My Lady?

889
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:19,980
- We must have Mrs Patmore.
- Of course.

890
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:22,060
- Oh, no, no, no. You don't want me.
- I insist.

891
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:26,230
A picture to mark our
gratitude for a marvellous tea.

892
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:31,870
Are we ready? Three, two, one.

893
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:37,780
And you promise you haven't cheated?

894
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:41,020
As God is my witness, I haven't set
eyes on her since yesterday lunch.

895
01:06:41,070 --> 01:06:45,220
- I even had breakfast in my room.
- That was Carson.

896
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,270
He wouldn't take any chances
with Mary's happiness.

897
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,740
Strange. I'll be best man
at both of her weddings.

898
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,420
I hadn't thought of it.

899
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:57,220
You've been a good friend
in this, Tom. Thank you.

900
01:06:57,270 --> 01:06:59,830
Pay me back by looking after her.

901
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,310
Who's that?

902
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:14,300
What? I don't believe it! Why
didn't you say to expect you?

903
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:18,940
- Because I wasn't sure until I got
on the train. - How are you feeling?

904
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,580
Fine. Can you not ask me
that for the rest of the day?

905
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,830
- Could you leave us for a moment?
- Of course.

906
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,650
We'll wait for you downstairs.

907
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:36,260
You know I'm sorry.

908
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:40,830
I assumed you would be fairly sorry
unless you're actually insane.

909
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:47,940
I'm not insane but I am sorry, I
don't know why I did it. Not really.

910
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:49,500
I've told you.

911
01:07:49,550 --> 01:07:53,660
Because you were unhappy so you
wanted me to be unhappy, too.

912
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:58,430
Now you're happy again, you'll
be nicer... for a while.

913
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,830
If that's what you feel,
then why are you here?

914
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:10,300
Because, in the end, you're my sister

915
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:14,630
and one day, only we
will remember Sybil...

916
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:21,100
.. or Mama or Papa or Matthew

917
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,580
or Michael or Granny or Carson

918
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:28,030
or any of the others who
have peopled our youth...

919
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:34,940
.. until, at last, our
shared memories will mean more

920
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:37,270
than our mutual dislike.

921
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:45,530
What do you think he'd have made of it?

922
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:52,390
I went to his grave to tell
him, which isn't like me.

923
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:57,910
Matthew loved you and
wanted you to be happy.

924
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:04,550
I'm sure he'd be very, very
pleased. In fact, I know he would.

925
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,150
- You look nice, by the way.
- Thank you.

926
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:24,670
You'd better go in and find a
seat. I'll wait for her here.

927
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:33,020
- Amelia said you called on her.
- Yes. I did. We were talking about Larry.

928
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,700
- Really? Was it productive?
- That rather depends on him.

929
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,340
But surely she was --

930
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:42,870
The ball is in Larry's court,
Lord Merton, only he can play it.

931
01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:03,070
Those whom God hath joined
together let no man put asunder.

932
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:10,620
For as much as Henry and Mary have
consented together in Holy Wedlock

933
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:14,590
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

934
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:22,220
.. and thereto have given and
pledged their troth either to other,

935
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:27,260
and have declared the same by
giving and receiving of a ring,

936
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,510
and by joining of hands...

937
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:34,270
.. I pronounce that they
be man and wife together.

938
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:42,070
In the Name of the Father, and
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

939
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,190
- Amen. - Amen. - Amen.

940
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,700
Congratulations, Henry!

941
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,220
Thank you.

942
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,060
That was a treat, but we'll pay for it now

943
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:02,110
if we don't get home
to serve the breakfast.

944
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:08,820
Well, Mr Talbot. You have
swept me off my feet.

945
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:12,150
- I promise you won't be sorry.
- I'd better not be.

946
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,950
There they go, a new
couple in a new world.

947
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:27,860
It seems all our ships
are coming into port.

948
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:32,220
- And Edith? - Of all my children,
Edith has given me the most surprises.

949
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:36,060
Yes, surprises of the most mixed variety.

950
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,180
A surprise is a surprise, Mama,

951
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:41,470
and I'm sure we haven't
seen the last one yet.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

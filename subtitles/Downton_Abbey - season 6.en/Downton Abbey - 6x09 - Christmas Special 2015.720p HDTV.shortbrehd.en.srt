1
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,290
Come on then.

2
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,720
Oh, what a big throw, well done.

3
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,160
Put Marigold into a school in London?

4
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,690
People do send girls to school, you know.

5
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,690
Nowadays it isn't all
governesses teaching quadrilles.

6
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,940
Does she have any relations
who ought to be kept informed?

7
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,650
- None that we're aware of.
- You'd live in London for term time?

8
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,530
I think so. The magazine's
going better than ever

9
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,650
and I enjoy working with Miss Edmunds.

10
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,970
'A life change for Lady
Edith Crawley is announced

11
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,370
as the family take a morning stroll'.

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,570
I think it's a good idea. Meet new people.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,330
I just think it's a bit hasty.

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,730
Hasty? I think I've been
about as hasty as a glacier.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,770
- And you'd be happy to live alone?
- I'll have Marigold.

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,140
Anyway, I'm a spinster, aren't
I? And spinsters live alone.

17
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,010
Is Mama better? I should call on her.

18
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,450
Oh, she's just tired. It'll do
her no harm to spend a day in bed.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,980
- I pity poor Denker.
- Denker can look after herself.

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,370
Are you all right, darling?

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,020
- Don't I look all right?
- Well, you just seem a bit down in the dumps.

22
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,730
Mmm, sorry.

23
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,780
No, don't apologise.

24
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,010
I'm just worried. I want to help.

25
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,860
I don't think anyone can help, I'm afraid.

26
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,850
Look, I know you're still upset
about the crash. Of course you are.

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,010
Those things are bound to linger.

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,850
If it is, it's not what you think.

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,700
I don't blame myself for Charlie's
death any longer -- truly.

30
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,980
But somehow it seems to have
taken all the fun out of driving.

31
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,020
Ah, I'm glad I've got the
three of you at last.

32
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,970
What do you mean?

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,620
I've never had a proper chance
to say thank you for rescuing me,

34
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,530
there's always been other people around.

35
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,090
- We were glad to do it.
- The good thing is, you can stay.

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,010
They've given me a breathing space
but I can't live on pity for ever.

37
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,130
Still, it is a breathing
space. Make the most of it.

38
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,780
Why not use the time to try and
understand what brought you so low?

39
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,210
- How extraordinary!
- Well I'm only telling you what happened.

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,650
Larry Grey wrote, asking me to tea.

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,650
And I accepted, as I thought I must.

42
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,490
And then I telephoned to
be told they were in London.

43
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
And today I got this.

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,690
'Dear Mrs Crawley,
events have overtaken us

45
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,810
and we are not now free
to keep our engagement.

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
Yours, Amelia Grey.'

47
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,330
- How peculiar.
- Amen.

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,250
- What does Dickie say?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,610
I know he went with them to London
but I haven't heard a squeak since.

50
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,530
Well, that settles it, you
must beard him in his den.

51
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,930
Won't that encourage him?

52
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,050
Your feelings do you credit, my dear,

53
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,780
but never let tenderness be
a bar to a bit of snooping.

54
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,850
- Hm...
- Never.

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,770
As long as you know Miss
Baxter is happy to undertake

56
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,970
any or all of your
duties whenever you wish.

57
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,170
That's kind of her but I don't
want to stop yet. I've a way to go.

58
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,290
Very well, it's up to you.

59
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,010
I've no complaints but I still find
it odd that a woman in her condition

60
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,970
is working as a lady's maid.

61
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,490
- It's not what I'm used to.
- I should hope not.

62
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,570
Before the war, they were
almost never married.

63
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,210
- At least, if they were they retired.
- And this is the future?

64
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,130
If you're really asking, I think the
future is no ladies' maids at all,

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,900
- but we haven't quite got there. - Ooh!

66
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,770
Thank you, Molesley.

67
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,610
- What a cheering sound.
- Rather a break with tradition.

68
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,370
- Well, can't it be a new tradition?
- Let's hope so.

69
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,570
I spoke to Laura Edmunds today. I'm
going to go up to London tomorrow.

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,300
- Oh, I might drive you, if you like.
- I thought you had some time off.

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,850
- Well, I have a few things to do.
- Thank you.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,890
I have to pay a call on the way,
at Dower House, if you can bear it.

73
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,210
Of course.

74
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,850
I was down at the farm before
tea, doing Mr Mason's books.

75
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,050
- Ooh, you have come on. I admire it.
- I'm sure he was grateful.

76
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,370
That's enough love talk, Andy.

77
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,290
- Love talk?
- He's nice. You could do worse.

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,740
I could do a lot better, an' all.

79
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,530
I thought we might call on
Mama tomorrow afternoon.

80
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:16,050
- I'm sure she'd love that.
- That's no good for me.

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,650
- I have a meeting at the hospital.
- Can't you get out of it?

82
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,130
I don't want to. We're in the
middle of a whole reorganisation.

83
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,380
- I'm very involved.
- Better not tell Granny that.

84
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:29,330
- Oh, good God!
- I'm sorry, m'lord, I do apologise.

85
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,330
- No, never mind.
- I can't think what came over me.

86
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,720
It's nothing, it doesn't matter.

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,060
- I'll go and see Mama without you.
- Be my guest.

88
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,370
- Is Daisy about?
- Oh, you missed her, she's in bed.

89
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,820
Good, cos it's you I want to see.

90
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Oh, well, go on.

91
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,570
Is... Is Daisy interested in men?

92
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,890
What on earth are you implying?

93
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,970
I meant because she's do dedicated
to her work and her studies.

94
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,490
Oh, I see. Well, it's true she
was determined to pass her exams,

95
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,080
which she's done now, God bless her.

96
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,930
And as for being interested, well,

97
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,130
she's had her heart broken a few
times, don't worry about that.

98
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,170
- I don't want to break her heart. - No.

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,420
- Would you say I had a chance?
- Well, everyone has a chance, don't they?

100
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,490
If you do a bit of wooing.

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,880
Has she said anything about me?

102
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,980
- She doesn't think I'm good enough for her?
- Oh, get away with you!

103
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,600
- Good news, I hope.
- Good enough.

104
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,330
- Found a job. - Oh, I'm happy
for you, if it's what you want.

105
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,370
You know I wouldn't leave by choice,

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,970
but it's time to draw a curtain
over the past few months.

107
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,290
- Will you be working nearby?
- Not far. The other side of York.

108
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,210
- So, we'll still see you?
- What's this?

109
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,330
- Mr Barrow's found a job.
- Has he? Has he, indeed?

110
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,180
Well, I'm glad your efforts have
paid off, Mr Barrow. You deserve it.

111
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,650
Thank you, Mr Carson.

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:06,970
Mr Carson, I thought I might walk down
to the village, if you've no objection.

113
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,700
No, no, no. Oh, you could pick up
some silver polish at Bakewell's.

114
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
I might come with you.

115
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,290
Her ladyship won't like that.

116
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,680
It's very discreet, the colour.

117
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,850
It's called Nude.

118
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,440
That won't strengthen your argument.

119
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,460
I'll go.

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,810
If you'd like to wait in the drawing
room, m'lady. Miss Denker will tell
her ladyship that you're here.

121
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,930
Oh, it was you I came to see, actually.

122
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,490
Oh, m'lady, we're all ears.

123
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,020
- She means alone.
- Well, if I'm not wanted.

124
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,980
- When were you last wanted?
- I shall ignore that.

125
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,410
Shall we sit down?

126
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,050
If you're comfortable with me
sitting in your presence, m'lady.

127
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,490
- Well, we do in London.
- We are not in London,

128
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,650
we are in her ladyship's drawing room.

129
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,570
But I'm here as a publisher
speaking to her author,

130
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,380
because we are thinking of expanding
your column into a full page.

131
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,980
Really? That's er... good news.

132
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,050
- Do you think you can manage it?
- I believe so, m'lady.

133
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,650
Your tips on how to keep your husband
happy have gone down particularly well.

134
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,220
Oh, Betty, be quiet, I'm trying to listen.

135
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,010
And you wrote so well about dressing
for town and country in autumn.

136
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,890
- Could we have a little more of that?
- Oh, I'm full of ideas when it comes

137
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,180
to combining comfort and elegance, m'lady.

138
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,500
- You know shampoo comes from India.
- The word, you mean?

139
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,850
The word and the fact. They
were shampooing their hair

140
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,890
hundreds of years before us.

141
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,410
Then again, I'm not sure
I see the point of it.

142
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,250
- Hello, Mr Molesley, Miss Baxter.
- Hello.

143
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,690
- I'm glad I've caught you.
- Oh, why's that?

144
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,050
It seems that Mr Trewin wants
to retire. He told me on Sunday.

145
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,770
He'll finish the term and then
go to his sister's in Bath.

146
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,570
- Bath, oh, that's a long way off.
- The estate always reserves

147
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,770
three cottages for the school and
I don't want the custom to lapse,

148
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,370
so I wondered if you'd take Trewin's on,

149
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,450
as well as some of his duties.

150
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,610
- Goodness, I...
- You've time to think.

151
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,650
I don't need a decision yet.

152
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,650
- Er... - He will think about it,
Mr Dawes, I can promise you that.

153
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Good day.

154
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,090
- I can hardly believe it.
- But you will think about it,

155
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,300
- and you will make a sensible choice.
- Why do you say that?

156
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,570
Because I don't seem to be able
to do either, but never mind.

157
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,290
This isn't my moment, it's your moment.

158
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,380
And well done to you.

159
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,460
Oh.

160
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,290
Hang on, Spratt is your agony aunt?

161
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,010
You must promise to keep it secret.

162
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,180
- Won't your grandmother be furious?
- If she finds out.

163
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,290
- Oh, don't tell Mary.
- Why not?

164
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,250
I don't know, she'll
just... make a thing of it.

165
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,490
Look, your Mary isn't my Mary.

166
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,740
Let's hope it stays that way.

167
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,680
Do you value honesty, Mr Spratt?

168
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,290
Of course I do. What a question.

169
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,210
But you don't want to tell
me why Lady Edith was here?

170
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,740
I value honesty and discretion,
they are both virtues.

171
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,450
Hm. Because I wouldn't want to think
you were keeping anything secret,

172
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,370
or wrong, from my lady.

173
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,410
Anything wrong?

174
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,970
Involving Lady Edith Crawley,
daughter of the Earl Of Grantham?

175
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,010
- Are you mad?
- No!

176
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
I am not mad.

177
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,090
But I am curious.

178
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,300
Curiosity killed the cat.

179
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,880
Now I'm going for my constitutional.

180
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,730
I'm walking down to the
farm, if you want company.

181
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,770
I don't know if I'm going yet.

182
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
Right you are.

183
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,210
- He only wanted a walk. - Well, he can
go for a walk, I'm not stopping him.

184
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,490
Hm.

185
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,090
Nanny wants to take the
children out for a picnic,

186
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,290
- so could she have sandwiches instead
of a sit-down lunch? - Very well.

187
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,410
- Can I give you a cup?
- Oh, I don't mind if I do.

188
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,970
Oh, just in time. Could you
pour him one, too, please?

189
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,420
- What brings you in here?
- I was looking for Mr Molesley.

190
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,980
- When were you going to tell me?
- What about?

191
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,660
- The shaking.
- What shaking?

192
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,220
I am your wife. I love you.
Your secrets are safe with me.

193
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
What shaking?

194
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,850
- Ah, how can I help?
- I ran into Mr Dawes in the village.

195
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,410
And he wants you to take more lessons?

196
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,730
I think so, and he's offered me a cottage.

197
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,170
It'll be empty soon and
he doesn't want the estate

198
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,050
to have the excuse to take it back.

199
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,090
So, you're handing in your notice?

200
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,650
I don't know what I'm doing,
really. Except asking for advice.

201
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,170
You'll check with Mr Branson that taking
this cottage will suit the family?

202
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,970
Oh, yes. Heaven forfend he
should have a bit of good luck

203
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,620
without checking with the Holy Family.

204
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,330
- I just wanted to put you in the picture.
- Which I appreciate.

205
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

206
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,290
So, now Mr Barrow's going,
Mr Molesley is going,

207
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,620
and only Andrew stands
between me and Armageddon.

208
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,050
- M'lady.
- Oh!

209
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,570
Granny.

210
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,140
There, I was beginning to
forget what you looked like.

211
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,490
I'm glad you're back on your feet.

212
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,370
Shall I make some tea, m'lady?

213
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,410
Will you be here long enough to drink it?

214
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,260
Don't be spiky, Granny, of course we will.

215
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,770
Edith sends love. She's gone to London.

216
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,290
Not to see Bertie, I assume.

217
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,650
- 'Fraid not.
- Oh, sad.

218
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,840
Of course, I see his point.

219
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,180
- But I bet he regrets it.
- He's painted himself into a corner.

220
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,740
I know, why can't men ever paint
themselves out of a corner?

221
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,560
It's such a waste, for both of them.

222
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,650
You're very quiet, Mary.
What are you thinking?

223
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,170
It's just an idea you've given me.

224
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,770
That's all. Nothing to trouble you with.

225
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,850
- I'm afraid Cora couldn't
come today. - Why not?

226
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,810
Oh, don't be mysterious.

227
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,450
It's the last resort of
people with no secrets.

228
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,970
She's chairing a hospital meeting.

229
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,410
- I see. - Swallow it, Granny. It's
stuck in your craw long enough.

230
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,250
Oh, don't worry about me.
I gobbled it up long ago.

231
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,180
It's your father who seems to have
difficulty swallowing these days.

232
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,090
- This is a lovely surprise.
- Well, I've been quite worried.

233
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,330
You've kept so quiet since you
got back. How did you get on?

234
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,300
- I didn't like to bore you until I
knew the whole story. - What whole story?

235
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,420
Please.

236
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,450
I haven't been feeling too well lately.

237
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,490
I've been very tired and I've
had a rather sore tongue.

238
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,530
- Sore tongue?
- Odd, isn't it?

239
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,170
And then I started to
get a sort of tingling,

240
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,810
- I suppose you'd describe it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

241
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,360
- I didn't like to bother you.
- Well, I'm bothered now.

242
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,210
Well, Amelia carted me off to a
frightfully grand doctor in Harley Street

243
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,060
- and it seems I have anaemia.
- Oh, well.

244
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,810
It's a bit of a nuisance and you
have to fuss about your diet,

245
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,850
but you'll be fine.

246
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,890
Not quite.

247
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
It's pernicious anaemia.

248
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,660
They ran some blood tests and
telephoned with the news on Monday.

249
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,330
I'm not too downcast.

250
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,880
I've had a good innings. Seen
and done a lot in my time.

251
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,460
I should like to have been married to you.

252
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,640
But no man can have everything.

253
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,380
And at least we're friends again.

254
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,650
Oh, yes.

255
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
We're friends again.

256
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,370
Ah, well, I must say,
it's very nice, Edie.

257
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,460
Yes. Do you... Do you manage on your own?

258
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,210
Not quite. A charlady comes every morning

259
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,730
and her niece helps when I'm entertaining.

260
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,490
Here, let me. Yes, it's
really pretty simple.

261
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,530
Compared to Downton, obviously.

262
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,100
I don't think we should be fettered
by that sort of thing, do you?

263
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,770
Heavens, what a treat.

264
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,450
Aunt Rosamund's asked
me to dine at the Ritz.

265
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,580
- Would you like some tea?
- No, I ought to get back to the flat.

266
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,400
What are you up here for? You never said.

267
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,690
Oh, I don't see why I shouldn't tell you.

268
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,980
I'll have to tell everyone soon. I'm
thinking of giving up... driving.

269
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,690
Racing, that is.

270
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,410
Goodness. Does Mary know?

271
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,490
She knows I've lost the joy of it, yes.

272
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,460
- Since the crash?
- Is it so obvious?

273
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,970
Mary won't mind. She hates racing.

274
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,810
Maybe. But she certainly won't
enjoy the transformation

275
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,450
of her glamorous ace
of a husband into a man

276
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,440
who sits about the house
with nothing to do.

277
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,220
- Well, then, you must find something to do.
- Yes, I must, mustn't I?

278
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Anna? This is for you.

279
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,880
- And Mr Barrow, there you are.
- Thank you.

280
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,060
- What's that?
- It should be...

281
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,530
Yes, it is! A hairdryer for Lady Mary.

282
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,050
- I sent away for it.
- What's the point?

283
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,690
Why not just rub it dry
with a towel and comb it out?

284
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,810
There's more control. You can
smooth and shape the hair.

285
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,370
I think it'll be useful.

286
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,250
I've never changed my hairstyle.

287
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,290
Can I hold it?

288
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,090
It's heavy, in't it?

289
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,930
- Lord in heaven! What's that now?
- A hairdryer. Lady Mary wanted one.

290
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah, well, in that case...

291
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,770
Mr Carson, Lady Stiles wants me to
go on Sunday and start on Monday.

292
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,210
Unless you need me to work out my notice.

293
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,410
We won't insist on it.

294
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,090
- Downton Abbey without Mr Barrow --
- Nothing ungenerous.

295
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,140
- Are you really going?
- Even good things come to an end.

296
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,130
Well, I don't know if you're a
good or a bad thing, Mr Barrow,

297
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,250
but we've all been together a long time.

298
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,580
And on that moving note, I think
I'll check the dining room.

299
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,780
- I don't think you need to change your hair.
- Are you a fashion expert now?

300
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,090
- This way...
- Is it working out?

301
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,140
- Henry and Mary living at Downton?
- As far as I can tell.

302
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,500
He's far too good for Mary. They're happy.

303
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,410
Although it might be better if
he could find something to do.

304
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,660
Well, won't he go on driving?

305
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,540
What on earth?

306
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,020
How did you know I would be here?

307
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,720
- Are you leaving?
- I certainly am.

308
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Goodnight, darling.

309
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,570
I'll telephone in the morning.

310
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,890
Is this all a set-up?

311
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,610
Somebody tipped you off I was in London.

312
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,930
- Was it Papa?
- It was Mary.

313
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,420
Mary?! How?

314
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,660
- What did she do? - Booked the table
and got your aunt to play along.

315
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,970
- They thought you might not come if it were me.
- They were right there.

316
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,420
Will you stay now? Please.

317
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,440
May I bring you a menu,
m'lord, and perhaps a drink?

318
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,220
Thank you, yes, we'll have menus
and two glasses of Champagne.

319
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,240
Bertie, I don't know what I'm doing here.

320
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,370
You broke my heart.

321
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,410
I'm not blaming you, exactly.

322
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,330
- I know why you felt you had to --
- I want you back.

323
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,210
- Nothing's changed.
- I've changed.

324
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,330
Well, if you have, you haven't
said a word to me about it.

325
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,450
I don't believe you'd have spoken
now if Mary hadn't telephoned.

326
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,570
- I would have, I promise.
- But what's different?

327
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,820
I still have Marigold.
You have your mother.

328
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,400
- I've never told her we'd split up.
- Well, we have.

329
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,580
Would you believe me if I said
I couldn't live without you?

330
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,770
You've done a pretty good job
of living without me lately.

331
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,890
I've done a very bad job.

332
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
M'lady.

333
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
And for you, m'lord.

334
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,290
I don't understand what you want of me.

335
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,450
What are you asking?

336
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,700
- I want you to marry me.
- Just like that?

337
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,180
Whenever you choose,
but... that's what I want.

338
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,020
If I agreed, which is a big if,

339
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,530
would we tell your mother
the truth about Marigold?

340
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,170
Let me put it this way, if we tell
her, we'll have to break with her.

341
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,210
I'd prefer not to do that.

342
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,300
Even without your mother, there are
people out there who know the truth.

343
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,570
There could be gossip.
Are you ready for it?

344
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:27,120
Well, I hope to avoid it, but
I'm ready if you we can't.

345
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,980
The only thing I'm not ready
for is a life without you.

346
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,010
Why was Lady Edith ringing so
late? Mr Carson was quite worried.

347
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,010
I couldn't tell you.

348
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,250
I was finishing with her
ladyship when Mr Carson knocked.

349
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,420
- His lordship went down.
- I never think she has much luck.

350
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,730
It's not like you to care.

351
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,330
You know when Anna said I
should try to understand

352
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,780
- what brought me so low?
- Yes.

353
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,570
Well, I've been thinking and I
thought I might try to be someone else

354
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,820
- when I get to my new position.
- We do change as life goes on.

355
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,760
Or we could if our past would let us.

356
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,490
You know what, Miss Baxter?

357
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,330
I listen to Anna, you should
listen to Mr Molesley.

358
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,770
Forget about Coyle and
your time in prison.

359
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,930
You think the strong decision would
be to see him but you're wrong.

360
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,980
The strong decision is to
take away his power over you.

361
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Leave him behind, Miss
Baxter. Get on with your life.

362
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,010
Let that be my parting gift to you.

363
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,730
I wonder if you're right.

364
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
I am right.

365
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,170
- You're not going to believe it!
- She's pregnant again? - No!

366
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,370
- She's been arrested for treason?
- Not quite. She's back with Bertie

367
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,650
and we're going up withe them
to Brancaster to meet Mrs Pelham

368
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,900
and announce the engagement.

369
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,930
- Does she know about Marigold?
- No, and she's not going to.

370
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,090
That really must be Bertie's choice.

371
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,410
- When is this?
- Friday. They want to get on with it

372
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,210
and, heaven knows, so do I.

373
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,850
I've got a big meeting on Friday.

374
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,010
Cora, I don't often
insist but I insist now.

375
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,290
This is your second child,

376
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,090
who's hardly known a day's
happiness in the last ten years.

377
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,410
All right, I don't need the
Gettysburg Address, I'll do it.

378
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,890
I feel increasingly
that I'm in competition

379
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,610
with the hospital these
days and I usually lose.

380
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,420
- It almost makes me wish Mama had triumphed.
- Never mind it now.

381
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,700
Edith is going to be happy.
Just think about that.

382
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,660
You're right, of course. Hurrah.

383
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,930
- I'll help you down with the cases.
- Good. We'll go up after breakfast.

384
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,090
- I've so pleased for Lady Edith.
- I wonder when the wedding will be.

385
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,770
- That's all I need!
- I like weddings.

386
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,930
Ah, Mr Barrow, you'd better say goodbye
to his lordship before they leave.

387
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,450
You'll be gone when they get home.

388
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,660
I am sorry. Really.

389
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:08,290
The thing is, it seems odd to say
it but I find I'm desperately upset.

390
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,810
I keep bursting into tears.

391
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,850
Why, of course you do.

392
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,940
Why wouldn't you, when
you're in love with him?

393
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,450
Am I?

394
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,820
That phrase conjures up for me
dance cards and stolen kisses

395
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,930
and Mama waiting below in the carriage.

396
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,890
Not two old fuddy-duddies who
can barely manage the stairs.

397
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,540
It's good to be in love, whatever age.

398
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,570
I can't think why I turned him down.

399
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,940
I must have been mad.

400
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,320
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

401
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,530
After Prince Kuragin, did
you ever fall in love again?

402
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,010
You must know by now I never answer
any question more incriminating

403
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,460
than whether or not I need a rug.

404
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,060
Before I go, I want you to
know that I've made a decision.

405
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,220
I won't go and see Coyle.
I won't write, either.

406
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,330
I'm putting him out of my
life for good, and that's that.

407
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,690
- Can you stick to it?
- I think so.

408
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,250
He's got no power over me
now, and I won't give it back.

409
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,820
So, you've reached your decision.
Now it's up to me to reach mine.

410
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,260
Be strong in your new resolution,
and I know you'll be happier.

411
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,300
You had faith in me when I had
none in myself... and I'm grateful.

412
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,740
Oh!

413
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,970
What do you say, Mr Bates?

414
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,340
I'd say I'd rather we part
as friends than enemies.

415
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,130
Tell Henry we're sorry to miss
him. I hope he's all right.

416
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,170
Why do you say that?

417
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,730
No reason, but I have been a bit
worried about him since the crash.

418
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,980
Darling Papa, you are cleverer
than you look, aren't you?

419
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,360
- That's a relief.
- Darling...

420
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,660
Ah, Barrow.

421
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,820
Your lordship, your ladyship, I
wanted to thank you for everything.

422
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,210
- You're not going now.
- On Sunday morning, m'lady.

423
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,850
We've known some adventures
during your time with us.

424
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,450
I've learnt a great deal while
I've been here, my lord.

425
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,970
I'm afraid I've rather lectured you
at times, not to harshly, I hope.

426
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,610
On the contrary. I will begin my
new position with a new spirit,

427
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,610
and I have you to thank for that.

428
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,530
I'm glad if, on balance,
it's been rewarding for you.

429
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,540
I arrived here as a boy, I leave as a man.

430
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,890
Please will you give my
best wishes to Lady Edith?

431
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,410
We'll always be so grateful to
you for saving her from the fire.

432
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,460
And it turns out I saved
her for better things.

433
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,890
Very good luck to you, Barrow.

434
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Thank you, my lord.

435
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,760
Now, I'm afraid, we must get started.

436
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,060
- I hate goodbyes. - There seems
to be so many of them these days.

437
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,210
- I'm such a frump!
- No such thing.

438
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,650
I am. My hair, my clothes. I look
the same as I did ten years ago.

439
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,810
Oh, I wish I did.

440
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,650
- Well, would I give myself a job?
- I'd give you a job.

441
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,690
Are you here for a reason?

442
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,130
- Er... Mr Carson says they're
going into the library. - Right.

443
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,180
There it is, off you go.

444
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,970
- Do you know your problem?
- I bet I soon will.

445
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,890
You despise anyone who thinks well of you.

446
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,850
If a man should like you, you
think he must be rubbish.

447
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,890
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

448
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,010
You were soft on Alfred, mad for
him when he only had eyes for Ivy.

449
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,530
But when he made a play for you,
you'd have nothing to do with him.

450
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,720
- That's different.
- How?

451
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,940
Mrs Pelham's in the yellow drawing
room, my lord. If you'd follow me...

452
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,050
You have to admit it's quite something.

453
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,700
As long as she's happy.

454
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,850
The Earl and Countess Of Grantham.

455
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,930
I'm sorry I wasn't here
to welcome you earlier.

456
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,290
- I do hope they made you comfortable.
- To a legendary degree.

457
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
Here's Edith.

458
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,730
- Darling.
- Hello, Papa.

459
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,890
- And you're sure you won't miss it?
- D'you know, I don't think so.

460
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,770
- In fact, I feel lighter already, really.
- Well, I'm thrilled

461
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,450
and I can't pretend otherwise.

462
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,210
- But you still love cars?
- Don't worry, I still love cars.

463
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,780
You're not alone in that, I just...
I don't want to race any more.

464
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,010
Then you'll have to find another
way to express your love.

465
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,730
More to the point, I have to find a job.

466
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,490
- Mr Carson, are you all right?
- Ye...

467
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,370
- I can't think how I --
- Let me help you, Mr Carson.

468
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,890
You must rest, Carson. Do you
want to sit here or go downstairs?

469
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,940
I'll go down, I think,
m'lady, with your permission.

470
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,010
- I'll go down.
- Don't worry about a thing.

471
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,810
Molesley will take care of us.

472
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,060
Andrew, could you help
Carson, and find Mrs Hughes?

473
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,060
That's all right, thank you.

474
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,280
I'll go and check on him later.

475
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,860
Drink this, it'll calm you down.

476
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,730
I suppose you think I'm a drunk

477
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,780
or trembling with fear
at the onset of old age.

478
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,890
I do not, but I would
like to know what it is.

479
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,890
- I'll make an appointment.
- There's no need.

480
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,650
I don't believe ignorance is bliss.
At any rate, it isn't bliss to me.

481
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,500
There's no need because I know what it is.

482
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,090
My father had it, and my grandfather,

483
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,080
and it finished the
careers of both of them.

484
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,020
It's not really a proper condition.
It doesn't even have a name.

485
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,050
Grandad called it 'the palsy',

486
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,700
but these days I just have 'shaky hands'

487
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,530
The plain truth is, I'm done for.

488
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,160
I came to see how you were.

489
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,980
I'll leave you to it, m'lady.

490
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,680
- I'm not ill.
- I'm sure not.

491
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,650
But you may be tired and
there's no shame in that.

492
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,370
Please don't concern yourself, m'lady.

493
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,010
You have more important
things to worry about.

494
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,580
Of course I'm concerned,
Carson, and you must help me.

495
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,560
You know how dear you are to me,

496
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,740
and if there are changes
that need to be made,

497
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,530
we mustn't be afraid to face them.

498
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,160
- Can I join you?
- Of course.

499
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,010
Mary's just gone down to
see if Carson's all right.

500
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,330
- Is she OK about everything?
- Well, I'd say she's concerned

501
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,050
about what happens next,
but that's allowed.

502
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,850
It can be hard for women to understand

503
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,010
that a man is what he does,

504
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,050
- to himself, anyway.
- Hm.

505
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,940
Still, things could be worse. I'm
fit, I have a wonderful wife,

506
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,530
I must just decide how to spend my life.

507
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,570
Just?

508
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,090
Well, at least Mary's
glad I've given up racing.

509
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,090
- She always hated it.
- She's not so glad.

510
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,930
- She'd rather you were happy.
- I want to be happy, of course,

511
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,530
but mainly I want to be worthy of her

512
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,660
and I know I sound like
Bulldog Drummond, but I do.

513
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:37,730
- So what sort of thing might interest
you? - You know me, I always come back
to cars or transport, at any rate.

514
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,890
And I'd like to be up here, so that
we can base our life at Downton.

515
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:46,530
A local business so you could still
be part of the family here but have
your own identity outside of it.

516
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,450
Well, you know the area,
Tom. If you have any ideas,

517
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,490
don't keep them to yourself.

518
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,130
I won't Henry. You can be sure of that.

519
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,890
Good.

520
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:59,450
- Did you inherit the household from
the Lord Hexham? - We did but I'm afraid

521
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,010
they had the run of the
place while he was here.

522
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,850
- Or while he was not here.
- You seem to be managing well.

523
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,330
- Do you live in the castle?
- You mean will I move out when Bertie marries?

524
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,450
- That's not what I --
- I have rooms that were made into a flat

525
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,810
for an aunt, so I'm very comfortable.

526
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,250
But don't worry, I'll
be well out of the way.

527
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,300
- Oh, I'm not at all worried.
- Of course not.

528
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,860
I told you, Mother, you're less
trouble in the house than out of it.

529
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,970
What an interesting time this must be for
you both at the start of a new reign.

530
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,890
What do you want to concentrate on most?

531
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,970
We want to rebuild Brancaster
as a moral centre for the area,

532
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,010
and only Bertie can do that.

533
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,690
Not just as a good landlord or farmer,

534
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,340
but as a moral man leading by example.

535
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,490
I'm sure Brancaster already
enjoys that reputation.

536
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,530
No, I'm afraid not. I'm sorry
to say that cousin Peter,

537
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,210
led a life that was not entirely --

538
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,170
Mother, I'm sure Lord and Lady
Grantham don't need to hear this.

539
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:56,970
- I disagree. If Lady Edith is to take --
- Oh, please, call me Edith.

540
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,530
Very well. If Edith is to take you
on, she should know what faces her.

541
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,890
Cousin Peter may have had his
merits but his morality was not

542
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,210
what I would call reassuring.

543
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,730
- Mother, please --
- Those visits to Tangiers.

544
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,780
I really must insist.

545
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,220
Very well.

546
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,010
But you should be in no two minds.
If you're to make a success here,

547
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,600
you can't afford to put a foot wrong.

548
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,900
I'll say good night.
Bertie will look after you.

549
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,220
Golly!

550
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,450
- We've been wasting your time,
and I apologise. - Not at all.

551
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,010
But I'm afraid the symptoms you describe

552
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,530
do seem to confirm it. I wish they didn't.

553
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,690
- I knew we shouldn't have bothered you.
- I wanted to be sure

554
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,530
and now we are we can
decide how to deal with it.

555
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,380
- We? - You don't think I'm going to
let you go through this alone, do you?

556
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,640
Goodbye, Dr Clarkson,
and thank you so much.

557
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,320
Why do you want to get
caught up in all this?

558
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,410
You know very well why.

559
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,810
There you are! I've been waiting.

560
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,850
- How did you know I was here?
- Jackson said he'd driven you to Mrs Crawley's

561
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,570
- and the maid there told me you were
at the hospital. - Quite a paperchase.

562
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,930
You'd make a good detective.

563
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,130
There is no need to fuss him with
more medical advice, Mrs Crawley,

564
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:34,570
we know the worst. Please leave
us to deal with it in our own way.

565
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,090
- Mrs Crawley wants to be involved.
- Father, there's really no need to burden her.

566
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,530
- I'm sure you wouldn't want that, would you?
- Well, not burden,

567
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,970
- but if she --
- Help his lordship into the car.

568
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
My lord.

569
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,730
Leave us alone, Mrs Crawley, just
leave us alone. That's all I ask.

570
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,530
All? It's a great deal. Of course,
when you thought you were going
to be saddled with him for years

571
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,210
I was a necessary evil,
but now that he has --

572
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,340
Heavens, is that the time?
Good day, Mrs Crawley.

573
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,250
- Ah, I've been looking for you. - Hm?

574
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,290
I wondered if you might like a walk.

575
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:19,100
I'd love one. So... I've been thinking.

576
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,170
About what I can do that would
make me a worthy husband.

577
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,290
- Oh, don't be silly.
- No, I'm serious.

578
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,330
While driving, I wasn't an equal
match but I was an eccentric,

579
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,370
maybe even exciting, choice.

580
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,490
But now I'm just a poor man
being supported by a rich wife

581
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,530
and that's not what I want for you.

582
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,300
- I don't want your having to explain me.
- I don't mind explaining you.

583
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,130
But the worst of it it,
I've done it to myself,

584
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,450
which is why I have to get
moving, and this isn't self-pity.

585
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,490
I just know that I'm right.

586
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,970
I'm so in love with you, you know.

587
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,420
I do know and it motivates all
my thinking and everything I do.

588
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
How very cheering.

589
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,060
We're all being taken on
a tour of the grounds.

590
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,370
Bertie says it's the best view
and, of course, he's right.

591
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,130
Did he tell you there's a dinner
on Monday to make the announcement?

592
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,380
I just wish I was sure I'm
doing the right thing. For him.

593
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,900
He had the chance to get away if
he'd wanted to, and he came back.

594
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,850
I'm not convinced he's faced
up to what could happen

595
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,930
with his mother or
anybody, if it gets out.

596
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,610
- But why should it get out?
- Well, Papa, at the beginning

597
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,170
nobody was supposed to
know except Rosamund.

598
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,900
Now you know and Mama and Mary and
Tom, and Henry, I assume, and...

599
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,730
probably Anna and Mrs Hughes, which
means Bates and Carson will know.

600
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,320
I doubt he's told Carson, he'd faint.

601
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,140
Well, maybe not, but she'll have
told Mrs Patmore and so it goes on.

602
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,610
How could it possibly not get out?

603
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,650
Then you're taking a chance but, darling,

604
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,380
I hope you'll take that chance and
live a good life with a nice man.

605
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,570
Please.

606
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:12,050
This isn't just loyalty
to Michael Gregson, is it?

607
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,100
No. It's not about that.

608
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,180
I loved Michael very much,
but he's gone, and...

609
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,300
now I'm in love with Bertie.

610
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,330
- More than ever, in fact.
- Which is what matters.

611
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,860
Please don't make your life more
difficult than it needs to be.

612
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,010
Now come on, they'll be waiting for us.

613
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,850
Well, I wish you well, I do, truly.

614
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,210
I expect you'll all be
glad to see the back of me.

615
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,530
Well, I won't. Give me a kiss.

616
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,700
Oh!

617
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,210
Look after yourself, and the
people you're working with,

618
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,890
try to get them on your
side. You can do it.

619
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:56,210
- Be nicer, you mean.
- Well, it wouldn't hurt, Mr Barrow.

620
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,850
You're quick and efficient and
no-one's ever called you stupid.

621
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,500
- There's no reason why you shouldn't get on.
- Thank you, Mr Carson.

622
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,540
I've learnt a great deal
from you and... I'm grateful.

623
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,210
- Good luck, Mr Barrow.
- Mr Molesley.

624
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,170
Thank you for all your help,
Mr Barrow. I'm only sorry I --

625
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,210
Oh...

626
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,970
You're a hard worker, Andy, and
a clever fellow. I wish you well.

627
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,210
- Mr Barrow!
- They wanted to say goodbye,

628
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,370
and Anna told me when you were leaving.

629
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,690
You've just caught me, m'lady.

630
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,610
Oh, well, Master George, I hope
you'll be good when I'm gone.

631
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,650
No, we won't.

632
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,690
Please don't go.

633
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,530
Oh, I must go, Master George,

634
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,140
but remember I will always
be your friend wherever I am.

635
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
All right? Good lad.

636
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
Oh!

637
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,300
Thank you.

638
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,460
Right, that's it.

639
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Come along. Goodbye,
Barrow, and good luck.

640
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,540
Goodbye, Mr Barrow.

641
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,240
Strange to think I were soft on him once.

642
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,660
Well, you were never much of
a judge in that department.

643
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,090
I'm sorry to disturb you.

644
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,560
I was just catching up with some letters.

645
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,920
- Is breakfast finished?
- Yes.

646
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,890
I've come because there's something
I feel you ought to be aware of

647
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:44,140
before the announcement of
the engagement this evening.

648
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,420
- Does Bertie know you're here?
- No.

649
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,250
But he knows what you're about to tell me?

650
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,740
Yes. He knows everything.

651
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Well, er...

652
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,900
You'd better begin.

653
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,250
- Do you know where everything is?
- I think so, Sir Mark.

654
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,770
I can always ask Mrs
Jenkins, if I'm mistaken.

655
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,010
The maid, Elsie, will be
in soon. She can help.

656
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
Is that it, Sir Mark?

657
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,530
Mrs Jenkins, me and Elsie?

658
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,260
Yes. This is not 1850, you know.

659
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,900
- What are you doing?
- Andy's lending a hand with the sties.

660
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,130
The piglets will be here before we know it

661
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,570
and I need to start
separating the mothers.

662
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,300
- Who else have you got to help you?
- Only old Joe, same as always.

663
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,690
I take on two men for the
harvest and the piglets,

664
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,130
but it's mighty helpful to have
the use of a young man's muscles

665
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,570
at no extra charge.

666
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,610
You should have said you were coming.
I could have walked with you.

667
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,200
No, didn't want to bother you again.

668
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
He's a crackin' lad.

669
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,930
The fact is, I'm getting older, Daisy.

670
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,130
I've been hoping you might move in,

671
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,890
but at least I've got Andy to count on.

672
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,130
I am still thinking about it, I promise.

673
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,770
But it's a big step to be cut
off from the life of the house.

674
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:37,020
You'd not be cut off. Not
if you didn't want to be.

675
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,290
- Have you got any more nails?
- Yeah, got them here.

676
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,330
Erm... Would you like a cup of tea?

677
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,090
No, don't worry. Daisy's
come to talk to you, not me,

678
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,080
as I know well enough.

679
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,700
- What's happened? Have you fallen out?
- We haven't fallen out, exactly.

680
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,460
We just didn't quite fall in,
not in the way he'd have liked.

681
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,810
You could do worse.

682
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,970
So everyone keeps saying.

683
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,900
- Where are they?
- Gone for a walk.

684
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,260
I know you know.

685
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,490
- Edith's told me she came to you this morning.
- Why didn't you tell me?

686
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,250
- I wanted to spare you.
- Is that the word?

687
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,210
I'd have kept you in the dark. It
was Edith's decision to speak up.

688
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:48,530
Is that supposed to make her
sordid revelations fragrant?

689
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,620
For me, he story shows only her
courage, her decency, her loyalty,

690
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,250
and her high regard for truth!

691
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,410
- I can reach my own conclusions.
- I'm not a child, Mother.

692
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,460
I won't be dictated to.

693
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,460
Bertie, you've a tough task ahead of you.

694
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:10,420
A task few would envy, if
they knew much about it.

695
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,250
You need a wife with the
strength of character

696
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,290
and the highest moral probity.

697
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,650
I quite agree, and I
have chosen accordingly.

698
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,840
But Edith is damaged goods.

699
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,290
I do not dislike her, but she's
ruled herself out of the running

700
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,680
and what is more, she knows it.

701
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,610
I'm glad you don't dislike her, Mother.

702
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,960
Now I think we should
probably bring this to an end.

703
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,970
- They said you were here.
- I asked them to tell Lord Merton.

704
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
He's resting.

705
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:57,090
I'm beginning to understand why
I was instructed to wait outside.

706
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,850
Mrs Crawley, my father-in-law is
dying. He has a short time left.

707
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,440
He wants to spend it with his family.

708
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:08,370
- Is that so hard to understand?
- I would like to hear it from his lips.

709
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:11,020
That won't be possible. Good day.

710
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,770
- We ought to get them back. It's very
late. Nanny will be in a fret. - No.

711
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,930
- But Mummy will be wondering where
we are. - I'm working. - Me, too.

712
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,490
Quite right. So, I'll
start looking tomorrow.

713
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,610
- Will you tell Mary? - I don't think
so, not yet. She'd find it too odd.

714
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,170
- She's more imagination than you give
her credit for. - I give her credit,

715
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,850
but we're outsiders you and I.

716
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,740
- In different ways.
- Maybe.

717
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,530
But this time I want to set it up
without their help. Do you mind?

718
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,090
- It means a lot to me.
- No, I'm grateful.

719
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm ready for this
chance, just like you are.

720
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,250
- Come on.
- Come on.

721
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,290
Hup!

722
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,490
Tell Mrs Potter, Mrs Crawley
will stay for some supper.

723
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,810
- We won't change.
- I don't mind what I eat.

724
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,850
Nonsense. She always cooks for ten.

725
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,840
- You'd better tell Spratt.
- I will, m'lady.

726
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,170
- If I can find him.
- What?

727
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:15,340
Well, he's so busy these days.
So taken up, so preoccupied.

728
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,130
- What was all that about?
- In Denker's mind, she is Salome.

729
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,930
You know, dancing rings
around Spratt's Herod.

730
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,130
Now, please tell me more. Did
Mrs Grey actually throw you out?

731
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,060
Well, she never let me in. But yes.

732
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,600
So, he's... he's their captive.

733
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,380
- Well, maybe he does only want to
see his family. - No such thing!

734
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,700
They've got him under lock and key.

735
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,860
Now he's on the way out, there
must be no claims on the estate.

736
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,970
- That's what this is all about.
- I can hardly push my way past the servants

737
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,930
- and run upstairs to his bedroom.
- I don't see why not.

738
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:57,620
As my late father used to say,
if reason fails, try force.

739
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,570
Look at that.

740
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,620
I always hoped it would
pass me by, but no such luck.

741
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,250
That's all there is to it.

742
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,400
- Oh, you're busy.
- No, no. What is it?

743
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,330
I'm going to accept the offer
from Mr Dawes, of the cottage.

744
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,380
I see. So, now I'm down
to one footman and me.

745
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,610
I thought about that. I
wondered if for a house party

746
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,250
or on special occasions,
I could... come back.

747
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,850
I've got my livery. I'd just
walk up from the village.

748
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,900
Your livery stays here.

749
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,530
That's kind, Mr Molesley.

750
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,130
Mr Carson will be extremely
grateful when he's in his right mind.

751
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:39,050
Thank you. Do you know when you'll go?

752
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,210
- Depends if you would like me to
work out my notice. - No need for that.

753
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,010
- I might as well get used to it.
- Then I'll move my things gradually

754
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,050
and move out in a week or so.

755
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,100
I'll tell you when.

756
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,020
Mr Carson, are you all right?

757
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Never better.

758
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,730
Why say you're never better?

759
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,100
I see, I'm to tell my private
business to the whole world now.

760
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,330
And when was I ever not in my right mind?

761
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,450
Well, really. 'Your livery
stays here.' I ask you.

762
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:17,290
The fact remains that we
are down to Andrew and me

763
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,540
and I am worse than useless.

764
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,730
I couldn't come to live here
and see your mother every day

765
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,690
and watch her play with Marigold
and leave her in the dark.

766
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,690
- I just couldn't. - She never
played with me much. Never mind that.

767
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,850
Excuse me.

768
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,370
We've each made our positions
clear and now we must play it out.

769
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,210
- Was it really necessary?
- It was to me.

770
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,570
I'm glad you said it.
I'm very proud of you.

771
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,580
Uh-oh, here she comes
now. Smiles, everyone.

772
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,100
The Earl and Countess Of Lisburn.

773
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:57,090
I don't believe I'll have any
cheese. What about you, my dear?

774
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,130
- No.
- No?

775
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,180
Then we'll go through.

776
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,300
- Is this the moment?
- What moment?

777
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,020
- My lords, ladies and gentlemen --
- May I say a few words?

778
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,770
I think it a mother's place to thank
you all for your kindness to my son

779
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:45,210
in coming here to support
him here tonight.

780
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,450
This change in his life is a
great responsibility, of course,

781
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,820
but it's reassuring for us both to know...

782
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,250
that we are surrounded by friends.

783
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,460
I drink to you all.

784
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,040
And now it's my turn to make
an announcement of my own.

785
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,890
- I have a hard task....
- I suggest you speak now,

786
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,930
or you've lost him forever.

787
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,720
Let me make this very happy announcement.

788
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:22,250
You see my son is engaged to marry
the wonderful Lady Edith Crawley,

789
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,840
who is here tonight with her parents.

790
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,970
Let us drink their health.

791
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,300
Edith and Bertie.

792
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,860
Edith and Bertie.

793
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,610
Andy's been so helpful to Mr Mason.

794
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:50,770
Well, I should think he has.
Of course, he's fond of him.

795
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,930
But you can be fond of someone
and not work as hard as that.

796
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:57,770
- It does me good to hear you say such things.
- I don't mean anyway by it.

797
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,770
Oh, that's your story and
you're sticking to it.

798
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,410
Oh, hello. What can I do for you?

799
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,570
Just looked in to say
good night. We're going.

800
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,090
Oh, back to the carefree love-nest.

801
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:13,300
- I hope.
- Oh, it's a love-nest, all right.

802
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,010
But no life is care free.

803
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Good night.

804
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,410
Well, that was a turn-up for the books.

805
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,050
She gave you no clue that was coming?

806
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,650
She hasn't spoken to
me since this morning.

807
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,050
I don't mind admitting I'm amazed.

808
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,900
Delighted, but amazed.

809
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,420
I'm afraid that is a reflection on me.

810
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,980
Oh, no, not at all.

811
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,850
- I hope you won't regret it.
- Should I turn down a daughter-in-law

812
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,930
who, in addition to
having birth and brains,

813
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,660
is entirely and unimpeachably honest?

814
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,200
I have been waiting for
someone to work that out.

815
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:01,890
She was prepared to deny herself

816
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,730
a great position, to say
nothing of happiness,

817
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,930
rather than claim it by
deceit. We must applaud her.

818
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,450
Oh, absolutely.

819
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,130
And you're not just saying these
things to avoid a quarrel with Bertie?

820
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,490
That's part of it, yes, but I've
had the day to think about it,

821
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,780
and I believe we can make
a success of this. Truly.

822
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,650
Marvellous.

823
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,860
Good. Then everything's settled.

824
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,700
There is one more thing.

825
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,880
- What is it?
- Will you bally well kiss me?

826
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,390
Has anyone told Lord Merton we are here?

827
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,710
Certainly not. Nor will they.

828
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,590
You don't need Mrs Crawley to take
him off your hands any more, do you?

829
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,950
And you won't have to wait long,

830
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,470
so he lies upstairs in the shadow of
death, and does what you tell him.

831
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,190
Why should we disturb his peace?

832
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,230
I heard Lady Grantham's voice.

833
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,030
I can well believe it.

834
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,150
Why did nobody tell me they were here?

835
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,600
- What's he doing downstairs?
- He caught me unawares.

836
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,150
- And why have you stayed away?
- She didn't stay away.

837
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,390
She was denied entry.

838
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,790
- What? Is this true?
- Of course not.

839
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,550
Right, here's what we'll do. We'll
go up now and speak to your valet.

840
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,710
He can take everything you
need to my house this evening.

841
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,070
Father, this is all
unnecessary and unpleasant.

842
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,510
- Might I suggest that we --
- No. I've let you steer us long enough.

843
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,670
In future, I'll look after your father.

844
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,830
- But surely it would be
better for us -- - No!

845
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,400
Larry, as my son I love you, but
I've tried and failed to like you.

846
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,670
Will you please leave me to get
on with what remains of my life?

847
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,460
- But this is your home.
- Not any more!

848
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,590
Take it, and may you have joy of it.

849
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,960
And furthermore, I intend to marry
him as soon as it can be arranged.

850
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,070
This is ridiculous.
Father, Mrs Crawley wants

851
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,590
to take you away from
your son and your family

852
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,550
and kidnap you into marriage.

853
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,600
What do you say?

854
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,590
How perfectly marvellous.

855
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,080
And who can argue with that?

856
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,030
Thank you, Molesley.

857
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,390
- So your visit was a triumph?
- It was.

858
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,830
- When is the wedding?
- We were thinking Christmas would be fun.

859
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,600
- Maybe New Year's Eve, when the
decorations are still up. - Good idea.

860
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,460
Then you can wake in the
New Year with your new life.

861
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,310
Mary.

862
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,270
I know you made it all happen when
you rang Bertie and Aunt Rosamund.

863
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,790
I was never convinced it was over.

864
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,270
- But why did you do it?
- It was something Granny said.

865
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,060
What a waste it would be for both of you.

866
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,360
You're such a paradox.

867
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,320
You make me miserable for years,
and then you give me my life back.

868
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,120
Look, we're blood and we're stuck with it.

869
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,960
So, let's try and do a
little better in future.

870
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,270
So, Lady Edith's to be a marchioness.

871
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,390
Which almost makes up for
Lady Mary not being a duchess.

872
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,670
Ooh! Hark at you, Becky Sharp.

873
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,870
They've gone into dinner and his
lordship wants an early night.

874
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,510
I don't blame him. I
wouldn't mind one, either.

875
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,630
I never thanked you for all your
hard work at the farm, not properly.

876
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,670
No need. I did it for Mr Mason.

877
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,060
Well, I'm very grateful, anyway.

878
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,480
I know you don't like me,
Daisy, not as I like you.

879
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,240
- So let's not pretend.
Let's be honest. - Andy!

880
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,190
Don't tell me, he's gone off
you, so now you're sweet on him.

881
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:04,180
- Not exactly.
- Near enough, I'll be bound.

882
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,190
- While you were away, I --
- Decided to accept Mr Dawes' offer.

883
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,750
I knew you would, and I'm glad.

884
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,510
Well, we won't lose touch,
I'll walk up here often.

885
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,680
No, we won't lose touch.
You can be sure of that.

886
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,110
Right. We've got three months to plan
this wedding so I don't want any mistakes.

887
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:27,880
I don't think people want mistakes,
Mrs Patmore, they just happen.

888
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,360
- I think they are the ones her
ladyship meant. - Very good.

889
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:00,830
- Carson! - Lady Rose.
How very nice to see you.

890
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,950
- Mr Aldridge. - Hello, Carson. - Hello.

891
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,550
- Rose! Atticus! We weren't expecting
you for another hour at least. - Cora.

892
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,390
The crew were very efficient
getting our bags off.

893
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,430
I should think they were eager
to be rid of us. Oh, Mary.

894
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,750
Hello, Henry, how are
you? Lovely to see you.

895
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,870
- And where's the baby?
- Oh, I'm afraid we didn't bring her.

896
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,670
- Nanny wouldn't let us.
- And you have to do what Nanny says.

897
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,920
They're always such tyrants.

898
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,470
She kept on about the diseases on board

899
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,110
and all the germs she'd
bring back from England.

900
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,310
- But she missed Christmas
with you. - I know.

901
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:36,150
The poor captain made such an effort
with flags and Christmas trees,

902
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,310
but I just wept every day of the voyage.

903
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,790
- She wouldn't know if it was Christmas
or Tuesday. - What a man thing to say.

904
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,230
- She's only three months old.
- But such a clever three months.

905
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,950
I've got masses of pictures.
Where's Daddy? I'm dying to see him.

906
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,590
He was hoping to be here for dinner but
he telephoned to say he'd be a bit late.

907
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:56,110
- Do you know how thrilled he is to
be giving the speeches? - So am I.

908
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,830
- Oh! - Darling Rose, how lovely
to see you. - You, too. Hello.

909
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,270
And Atticus.

910
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,630
Wasn't he cunning to
get the time off work?

911
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,750
He's actually got lots
to do for them in London

912
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,870
but we're pretending
were just here for fun.

913
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,550
- Let's start the fun by having tea
in the library. Carson? - M'lady.

914
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,710
Oh, in a moment. I must run down
and say hello to the servants.

915
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,830
I know she's a wife and mother now
but she seems quite unchanged to me.

916
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,880
- A sign of your care of her.
- Or my weakness.

917
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,030
Let's go in.

918
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,030
- Oh, she's beautiful.
- Just like her father.

919
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,950
- She's Victoria, m'lady?
- Yes, Victoria Rachel,

920
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,910
for Mr Aldridge's mother,
and Cora for Lady Grantham.

921
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,230
Oh, not Susan for your own mother?

922
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,270
No.

923
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,390
I didn't expect to see you, Molesley.

924
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,230
- Lady Mary wrote you are a teacher now.
- I am, m'lady,

925
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,190
but it's the holidays and I'm
here till the day of the wedding.

926
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,640
Oh, I hope Carson appreciates it.

927
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,190
Anna! Oh, look at you.

928
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,150
- When's it due?
- About ten days, m'lady.

929
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,670
Ooh, I don't envy you,
but it's such fun after.

930
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,190
That's what you've got
to keep telling yourself.

931
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,550
- Is Barrow here for the wedding?
- He's been invited, m'lady,

932
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,590
but I don't know if he'll
be able to get away.

933
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,990
- Of course, he's got a new job.
- And he hates it.

934
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,600
Oh, don't exaggerate! It's just
it's quieter than he's used to.

935
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:19,030
- You look familiar.
- Andy, m'lady. Andrew upstairs.

936
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,630
I joined for your wedding,
but a job came up here.

937
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,590
He's taken to country
life, haven't you, Andy?

938
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:28,550
Mrs Patmore, shall I ask Lady Mary
to come down and put the kettle on?

939
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,670
It's all ready, Mr Carson.

940
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,790
- What are you doing?
- Mind your own business.

941
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,670
Oh, Mr Spratt. I know you resent me.

942
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,910
- Why would I resent you?
- Because I'm interesting, because I'm exotic,

943
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,630
- because I'm attractive.
- Oh, dear me, this is worse than I thought.

944
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,150
Do you always have trouble
distinguishing fact from fiction?

945
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:03,910
It so happens, Mr Spratt, that
I have a high regard for truth,

946
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,950
unlike you.

947
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,150
Unlike me?

948
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,790
I know your dirty little secret.
I just wonder what her ladyship

949
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,070
would think about your double life.

950
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,560
- I beg your pardon.
- Butler by day, author by night.

951
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,260
Like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

952
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,360
- When did you find out?
- Lady Edith's visit.

953
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,790
Why have you not mentioned it
in the many weeks since then?

954
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,560
Because I thought I might spare
you, but now I don't like your tone.

955
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,630
So, what are you going to do?

956
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,480
That's for me to know and you to find out.

957
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,470
- I was so happy to hear about
you and Lord Merton. - Thank you.

958
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,990
I hope I wrote enough
about your wedding present,

959
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,790
it was too kind. Books are
Dickie's favourite thing.

960
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:57,830
- Why isn't he here tonight? - He wanted to be,
but I'm anxious he shouldn't get over-tired.

961
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,550
He's not well, you see.

962
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,790
I say that but, funnily enough,
he's a picture of health.

963
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,830
He'll certainly be at the wedding.

964
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,030
- Does he regret giving
Cavenham to Larry? - No.

965
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,750
Let him and Amelia wallow in splendour.

966
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,230
And much good may it do
them. We're happy as we are.

967
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,070
I have to preside over a meeting
at the hospital tomorrow afternoon.

968
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,870
- Fine.
- What sort of meeting?

969
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,790
We invite the public in.
Our financial supporters,

970
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,430
ordinary people, too. It's important
they understand what we're doing.

971
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,080
- The day before Edith's wedding?
- It'll be two hours at the most.

972
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,670
- We can help here, Atticus and me.
- That's not the point.

973
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,350
- What is the point?
- Tom and Mary and I

974
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,110
have an errand in York tomorrow, too.

975
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,720
I can manage. It's only the flowers
and they've already been chosen.

976
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,510
- Cora, surely you want to be here for that?
- Drop it, Robert.

977
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,550
What errand is this?

978
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Oh, you'll see.

979
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,390
Carson, could I have a
bit more of the claret?

980
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,640
- Andrew?
- It's just there.

981
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,390
Andrew will pour it, my lord.

982
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,510
Well, isn't it thrilling? It was
in all the papers, even in New York.

983
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,300
'Lady Edith and her millionaire Marquis.'

984
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,750
He wasn't either when he first proposed.

985
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,000
But he was when you accepted.

986
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,630
Sir Mark, may I remind you that
I will be away on New Year's Eve?

987
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,670
Mrs Jenkins will carry up the tea.

988
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,150
The cook? Carrying the
tea into the drawing room?

989
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,520
Lady Stiles said she'd
allow it, just this once.

990
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:30,080
Oh.

991
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,950
- There.
- Thank you.

992
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,800
- I'm sorry, I couldn't get away.
- Oh...

993
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,950
My darling, you look wonderful.

994
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,710
You look hungry, Papa. What about a tray?

995
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,500
Thank you, no, I had dinner on the train.

996
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,030
I hope I haven't let you
down, missing the flowers.

997
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:56,550
No. Papa just resents the hours
you spend at the hospital.

998
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,870
Hours I'm not spending on him.

999
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,910
I'm sure it's quite unconscious.

1000
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,350
Men are unconscious for
so much of the time.

1001
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,830
- I'm starting to think we should have
waited until after the wedding. - No.

1002
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,710
- She'll enjoy the wedding more. - Hm.

1003
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,550
- What's all this?
- Oh, I'm busy reinventing myself.

1004
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,310
I'm being reinvented, too.

1005
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,560
I rather like the old models.

1006
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,310
Don't you think Carson's behaviour
was rather odd at dinner?

1007
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,700
He hasn't been himself for ages.

1008
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,520
Should we go down now and
see what it's all about?

1009
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,550
There is no treatment, there is no cure.

1010
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,670
But I'm sorry if Lady Mary saw fit
to trouble you with it, my lord.

1011
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:37,020
She didn't. I was puzzled
by that business at dinner.

1012
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,750
I see. Well, perhaps it's for the best,

1013
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,190
because clearly I have no option
but to offer my resignation.

1014
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,190
What? You don't mean that.

1015
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,920
I'm sorry, my lord, but I cannot
stay if I cannot perform my duties.

1016
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,940
I should have been more
honest with you, my lady.

1017
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,470
Oh.

1018
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,990
- Oh, I didn't know you were in here.
- Please come in, Mrs Hughes,

1019
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,640
and talk some sense into your husband.

1020
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,500
So, he's told you, my lord.

1021
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:06,950
When the wedding is over, I
will place an advertisement

1022
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,710
and I will do the preliminary
interviews myself.

1023
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,710
I could not give this house or this family

1024
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,070
into hands that I do not trust.

1025
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,110
This is very drastic.

1026
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,910
But you'll stay in our lives, Carson?

1027
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,590
You'll stay on the estate,
Keep a seeing eye on things,

1028
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,560
help manage grand events and so on?

1029
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,100
I would like to say yes to that, my lady.

1030
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,470
but I doubt that the new
butler would accept the job

1031
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,520
under such terms. I know that I wouldn't.

1032
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,050
Dickie?

1033
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:53,090
- Dickie, what are you doing in the hospital?
- Oh, I feel a fool now.

1034
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:56,140
- You've caught me.
- You haven't answered my question.

1035
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,740
Well, the fact is, I live like an invalid.

1036
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,930
But I don't feel like an invalid.

1037
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,210
Your care of me has been wonderful.

1038
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:08,660
Even so, I should be fading
past by now, and I'm not.

1039
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,410
Why haven't you said any of this before?

1040
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,730
I didn't want to get your hopes up.

1041
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,970
- What did Dr Clarkson say?
- Well, he'll run the tests again

1042
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,770
before the wedding, but he says it's
highly unlikely the London men were wrong.

1043
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:24,220
A practice in Harley Street
doesn't guarantee excellence.

1044
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:30,530
That's the flowers done and
Brock will be back in the morning

1045
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:33,410
- to replace anything that's gone over.
- Oh, well done.

1046
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:36,250
- Where's Bertie staying?
- With his mother, at Castle Howard.

1047
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,650
- We should have asked him for dinner.
- Unlucky, so we won't risk that.

1048
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,820
- Where's Cora?
- Gone to the wretched hospital.

1049
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,930
- Why don't you like her going?
- They take advantage of her good nature.

1050
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,260
- But she enjoys it.
- That's why they're able to take advantage.

1051
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,700
What were Tom and Henry doing?
It seemed very hush-hush.

1052
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,770
Robert, could you bear it if I asked
you to drive me into the village?

1053
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,810
- What, now?
- I'll do it if you lend me the car.

1054
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,090
No, it's got to be Robert.
It won't take long.

1055
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:06,130
We'll be back before tea.

1056
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,050
- If you insist.
- I'm afraid I do, rather.

1057
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:16,530
- I wish you'd just tell me.
- No, it's a surprise.

1058
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,580
- I hate surprises.
- We're there now, anyway.

1059
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,610
- Well, what am I looking at?
- Well, isn't it obvious?

1060
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,650
Talbot & Branson Motors.

1061
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,000
- But it looks like a going concern.
- And so it is.

1062
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:32,410
A real live business, even if the
cars on show are the only stock,

1063
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,460
but we'll get more in.

1064
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,210
So, how will it work?

1065
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:44,690
For now, I'll go between
the estate office and here.

1066
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,770
- Henry will be here full-time.
- I'll still have cars in my life,

1067
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,530
but not racing, and we'll
build the business between us.

1068
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:53,970
All of which means you are
second-hand car salesmen.

1069
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:56,010
Well, we will be once we've sold one.

1070
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,050
Mary, now's not the time to be snobbish.

1071
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:00,290
We'll set up a dealership for new cars

1072
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,090
and in time we'll go into production.

1073
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:05,940
- There's nothing wrong with being
married to Mr Rolls or Mr Royce. - Hm!

1074
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,100
Have I miscalculated?
Are you ashamed of me?

1075
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:13,890
Of us?

1076
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,890
- Are you mad?
- Why?

1077
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,210
I'm as proud as anyone living.

1078
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,810
Thank God!

1079
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,530
Mmm-wah! I'll never ask for
another thing again, I swear.

1080
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:26,060
Yes, you will, and you're
going to get it, too.

1081
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,410
What? You're sure?

1082
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:33,050
I'm quite sure. But you
mustn't tell a soul,

1083
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,930
- I don't want to steal Edith's thunder.
- Which is, in itself,

1084
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:38,250
a sign of happy times to come.

1085
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,330
Why are we here?

1086
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,890
That deals with the business but
are there any other questions?

1087
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,650
Will the new insurance contract
cancel out the old one?

1088
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,530
No. All existing agreements will
be honoured in their entirety.

1089
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,530
You have my word on that.

1090
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:03,250
- Will Dr Clarkson --
- Ssh! Maud, don't waste her ladyship's time.

1091
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,610
That's what I'm here for. Miss?

1092
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:09,210
- Will Dr Clarkson be moving to York?
- No need to worry.

1093
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:12,360
He's going to stay right
here and look after you.

1094
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:15,130
What I need to reassure you about

1095
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,690
is that nothing really is going
to change on a day-to-day basis.

1096
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,210
As you all know, that doesn't
happen in a hospital where we are!

1097
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:27,060
What is it?

1098
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,810
It reminds me of when she ran
the house as a convalescent home

1099
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:32,780
during the war.

1100
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:37,100
Do you still think they're
taking advantage of her?

1101
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,370
If you want to keep her,
Robert, you must let her go.

1102
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:44,360
I'm not very good at
those American slogans.

1103
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,260
Then forget the slogan and listen to this.

1104
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,740
You have a wonderful marriage and
with my parents, I should know.

1105
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,330
Don't spoil it now by
asking her to choose.

1106
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:58,740
Please.

1107
01:08:01,100 --> 01:08:04,690
.. Using this hospital that has
served you so well and for so long.

1108
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,730
Is the coffee ready?

1109
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,450
- What are you wearing tomorrow?
- Oh, don't know.

1110
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,010
- One of my Sunday bests.
- I've nothing decent.

1111
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:15,810
Oh, I'm sure that's not true, but
we'll only be on the edge of things.

1112
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,850
I know, but I wanted to look nice.

1113
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,640
Wasn't Lady Rose's hair lovely yesterday?

1114
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,460
- So smooth and smart.
- You've got nice hair.

1115
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:28,020
Why not try a new style
if you aren't satisfied?

1116
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:30,530
Would you mind if I went
up a bit early tonight?

1117
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:32,610
- What's 'a bit'?
- Well, now,

1118
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:36,340
- when they're all still downstairs.
- What's that got to do with it?

1119
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:41,210
Oh, go on! But I warn you, I'll
leave the washing up for the morning.

1120
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:52,380
- Daisy, what are you doing up here?
- Just fetching something.

1121
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,450
Oh, I do worry about Mr Spratt.

1122
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,010
He seems to be burning
the candle at both ends,

1123
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:17,130
- and for all I know,
in the middle. - Oh.

1124
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:21,020
- Doesn't sound like the
Spratt I know. - I agree.

1125
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,330
He's changed since he took this new job.

1126
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:28,330
Gone, the reliable butler,
discreet and serious,

1127
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,770
and in his place, the journalist...

1128
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:34,100
spilling the beans on everyone he knows.

1129
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,620
Spratt is working as a journalist?

1130
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,450
Oh, I am sorry, m'lady,
I thought you knew.

1131
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,650
Never occurred to me
he would take the post

1132
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,970
without first gaining your permission.

1133
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,810
Do we know which publication employs him?

1134
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,450
Oh, yes, m'lady, Lady Edith's.

1135
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,260
Her magazine. I've got a copy
of it here, as a matter of fact.

1136
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:01,410
Oh, opened to the right page.

1137
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,330
How convenient.

1138
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,970
Oh, dear, I do feel responsible.

1139
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,560
Perhaps I should have held my tongue.

1140
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,010
But, I suppose, truth will out.

1141
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,970
Every time, Denker, every time.

1142
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,050
Please don't be too hard on
him when you give him notice.

1143
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:22,900
Please, for his sake, don't be too hard.

1144
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:29,380
So, why, why, why would I... why
would I give him his notice, Denker?

1145
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,940
Why... Why ever would I do that?

1146
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:40,060
I can't...

1147
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:08,610
Oh, put your feet up, you'll be
standing for the rest of the day.

1148
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,050
As I keep telling her.

1149
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,050
Where have you been? We've got a lot to do

1150
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,970
if we want to get to the church on time.

1151
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,410
- I'm not going.
- What are you talking about?

1152
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:19,410
The wedding. I've nothing to
wear and no-one cares if I go.

1153
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:22,010
- I'll stay and manage the food.
- Stuff and nonsense!

1154
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,410
- This is because Andy's
not interested. - What?

1155
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,490
- Andy's given her the brush-off.
- That is not true.

1156
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,050
- Why is your cap on like that?
- Like what?

1157
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:32,890
All pulled down over your
ears. What's the matter?

1158
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,010
Nothing.

1159
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,050
- Well, take it off.
- No.

1160
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,100
Daisy, take it off now.

1161
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:48,450
What have you been and done?

1162
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Oh, Daisy!

1163
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:53,780
Let her go. I'll talk to her later.

1164
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:59,890
Look, you can laugh, but it's for
you she's made a fool of herself.

1165
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:02,210
- But she doesn't care
a scrap about me. - Oh!

1166
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:04,250
No wonder you're on your own, lad.

1167
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,500
You don't know women at all.

1168
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,210
I can't believe this is happening,
really. At least, to me.

1169
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,330
- Are the children ready?
- I've asked Baxter to go and check.

1170
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:19,890
I've spoken to Mrs Pelham and I'm
going to take Marigold to Brancaster

1171
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,890
so she's there when you get
back from the honeymoon.

1172
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:27,260
- Nanny's getting the children ready now.
- We ought to get changed.

1173
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,930
I didn't know you had to
brush it at the same time.

1174
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,850
- You should have asked.
- You wouldn't have let me borrow it.

1175
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:39,810
- I wish you would sit down.
- I'm nearly done.

1176
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,850
How do I look?

1177
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,290
Like Clara Bow.

1178
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,250
Don't be soft.

1179
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,970
- Andy, would you help me pick
up the sheet? - I'll do that.

1180
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,010
- Don't fuss.
- I want to fuss.

1181
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:52,060
I'll do it.

1182
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:54,900
Thank you.

1183
01:13:03,740 --> 01:13:07,130
Daisy, I think we've been
out of step with each other.

1184
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:09,170
I don't know what you mean.

1185
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,960
If you really don't, then we'll leave it.

1186
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:17,820
But if you do, let's... not
be out of step any more.

1187
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,780
Yes, yes, indeed.

1188
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,480
A new baby, a new business.

1189
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:48,490
I suppose I must have been as happy
as this but I can't imagine when.

1190
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,210
Honestly! Ssh-ssh. And remind me
never to tell you a secret again.

1191
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,530
We didn't always think there'd
be a happy ending for Edith.

1192
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,900
Well, there's a lot at risk, but with
any luck they'll be happy enough.

1193
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:04,060
Which is the English
version of a happy ending.

1194
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,650
What do you think makes the
English the way we are?

1195
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,690
I don't know. Opinions differ.

1196
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,660
Some say our history,
but I blame the weather.

1197
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:17,080
Here you are, Miss Edmunds.

1198
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:20,610
- But isn't it too near the front?
- Certainly not.

1199
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,090
You've saved her life is anyone has.

1200
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,050
Well, I'm glad no-one blames
me for encouraging her to work.

1201
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,090
- We like strong women here.
- Do you really?

1202
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,140
I can assure you we like
them very much indeed.

1203
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,450
Erm... I'll need to move in a moment

1204
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,730
but I wanted to tell
you before the service.

1205
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,170
- I have the results.
- He hasn't got anaemia.

1206
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:47,330
- No, he has got anaemia.
- We won't embarrass you by fainting.

1207
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:50,410
- It's no great surprise, after all.
- No, you do have anaemia,

1208
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,810
- but it isn't pernicious.
- What?

1209
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:56,220
He has iron-deficient anaemia
with low haemoglobin.

1210
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:00,010
So, I'm not going to die.

1211
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,050
Well, you need to keep looking
after yourself, but er... no,

1212
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:06,300
you're not going to die.
Not of that, at any rate.

1213
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:08,860
Excuse me.

1214
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:18,290
- You managed to get away, then.
- Don't worry,

1215
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:20,680
the treadmill awaits my return.

1216
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,920
How's it going? Are you
getting on with everyone?

1217
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:27,340
There isn't much of an
everyone to get on with.

1218
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,740
Don't you enjoy it more than
being at war with all the world?

1219
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,860
I suppose.

1220
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:37,860
- What's the matter?
- It's just a bit hot in here.

1221
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,740
How lovely you look.

1222
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:05,060
Oh, Papa.

1223
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,090
Did you ever think we'd get to this day?

1224
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,730
I'm not sure.

1225
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:12,780
Maybe.

1226
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:15,730
You've always surprised me, you know.

1227
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,980
But no-one can plan on a brilliant match.

1228
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:22,650
I adore him. You understand that?

1229
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,170
Oh!

1230
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,420
Let me be a little bit proud.

1231
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,730
I'll calm down eventually.

1232
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,410
If you're proud of me,
please be as proud as you want

1233
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,460
for as long as you like.

1234
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:54,410
I'd like to say I had an inkling
when we met at Brancaster,

1235
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,810
- but I don't think I did.
- I certainly didn't.

1236
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,530
It's an odd thing. One minute
we hardly know each other

1237
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,780
and the next, we're related.

1238
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:08,020
Ready?

1239
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,050
Can't we just tell your parents?

1240
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:38,620
As soon as Edith leaves on honeymoon
we can tell the whole world.

1241
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:42,820
- Will you be best friends now?
- Oh, you're such a sentimentalist.

1242
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,970
But will you?

1243
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:50,220
Never you mind. We're sisters,
and sisters have secrets.

1244
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,660
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God

1245
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,920
and in the face of this congregation

1246
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,420
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony,

1247
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:14,130
which is an honourable
estate, instituted of God

1248
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:18,610
in the time of man's innocency,
and is therefore not by any

1249
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:21,490
to be enterprised, nor taken in hand,

1250
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:25,180
unadvisedly, lightly, or wantonly,

1251
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:31,170
but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly,

1252
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,780
and in the fear of God.

1253
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,570
If any man can show any just cause

1254
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:41,130
why they may not lawfully
be joined together,

1255
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:48,180
let him speak or else hereafter
for ever hold his peace.

1256
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:02,490
The last one's off our hands.

1257
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,250
Illogically, I feel a
great sense of achievement,

1258
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:08,210
though heaven knows I had
little enough to do with it.

1259
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,460
Still, it's a job well done.

1260
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,290
Shall I tell you another job well done?

1261
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,570
Your job at the hospital.

1262
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,610
What's brought this on?

1263
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,890
I came to the meeting yesterday.
Rose made me take her to see it.

1264
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:23,610
You should have said hello.

1265
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,860
I was too busy watching
and do you know something?

1266
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,860
I was very proud of you.

1267
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,640
- Don't say it if you don't mean it.
- I do mean it.

1268
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:36,610
You are a woman of real substance

1269
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:39,400
and I'm lucky enough to call you my wife.

1270
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,690
- So I don't have to give it up?
- You wouldn't have, anyway.

1271
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:44,740
Probably not!

1272
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:49,100
But it makes it so much sweeter
if it's with your approval.

1273
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,570
These are to go up to the waiting table.

1274
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:57,690
Take them through as they're needed.

1275
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:00,970
They're not nearly done. Get them
back in the oven but keep watch.

1276
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:03,450
No, don't put that one in yet.

1277
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:06,650
- Can I have the Epsom salts?
- Should you be taking them? Are you ill?

1278
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:08,810
Bit of an upset, nothing serious.

1279
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:12,370
I see it's all hands to the pump.
Still, it was a lovely service,

1280
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:15,100
and Lady Edith is married -- hallelujah.

1281
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:18,650
And with Miss Marigold
headed for Brancaster Castle,

1282
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:22,380
- all is set fair for the future.
- Although the less said, the better.

1283
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:26,770
- Will they ever tell her, I wonder?
- I expect so, when she's ready.

1284
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,810
- I wish you'd sit down.
- In a moment.

1285
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,860
I just want to put the
hairdryer back upstairs.

1286
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,980
I'll leave you to it.

1287
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,570
- I've decided to move into the farm.
- You won't regret it.

1288
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,610
I've decided a lot of things.

1289
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,490
But I won't tell you all of them now.

1290
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,540
Andy, get that upstairs!

1291
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,140
Can I have some more glasses?

1292
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,820
Uh! I cannot pour the bloody stuff!

1293
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:02,530
Carson, are you all right?

1294
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,580
I...

1295
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,850
- I do beg your pardon, my lord.
- Don't be silly.

1296
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,650
- I can pour it for you.
- No, I can do it, sir.

1297
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:13,170
Mr Barrow, you are here as a guest.

1298
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:15,420
I'm happy to help, Mr Carson.

1299
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,980
Carson, I know the answer.

1300
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:23,290
You and Mrs Hughes will
stay in your cottage,

1301
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:26,210
but what if we were to ask
Barrow to be the new butler?

1302
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:30,130
Carson, the elder statesman, would
steer things as he's always done.

1303
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,170
What do you think, Carson? You'll
have a pension from the estate.

1304
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:36,700
You can't pretend Barrow isn't
sufficiently experienced.

1305
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,500
No, I wouldn't say that,
m'lady. I trained him.

1306
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,860
Well, Barrow? Would you
like to be butler here?

1307
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:51,450
Certainly, my lady.

1308
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,170
That's settled.

1309
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:57,700
Barrow will work out his notice and start
at Downton on a date that suits you both.

1310
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,970
I don't want to force
your hand, Mr Barrow.

1311
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:11,020
And I don't want to twist
your arm, Mr Carson.

1312
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:14,220
I think his lordship has found a solution.

1313
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:16,980
So we should be glad of that.

1314
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,330
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir.

1315
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:31,850
Anna, you're not working, I hope.

1316
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:34,410
I just came to put the
hairdryer back, m'lady.

1317
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:36,290
It was a great success.

1318
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:38,930
This hat is so tight it
was giving me a headache.

1319
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:42,480
- Do you think we can stretch it?
- Let me try, m'lady.

1320
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:44,740
Oh, my God!

1321
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,500
Ah, your waters have broken.

1322
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:50,900
Right, no need to panic.

1323
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,210
Oh, I should get to the
cottage, my things are there.

1324
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:55,490
Oh!

1325
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,610
Don't be ridiculous, you can
wear one of my nightgowns.

1326
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,000
Right, let's get you undressed.

1327
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,780
- This doesn't seem right.
- What does all that matter now?

1328
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,260
Bates!

1329
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,650
Bates!

1330
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:14,700
- Bates!
- Mr Talbot.

1331
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:18,130
Ah, there you are. You'd better
come quickly, although heaven knows

1332
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,450
- how long it will be.
- I don't understand.

1333
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:25,740
Sorry. Anna is in Lady Mary's
room and Dr Clarkson is with her.

1334
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:28,860
Oh, my God!

1335
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,050
- But she can't have it now.
- She hasn't a lot of choice.

1336
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,740
In Lady Mary's bedroom? Surely not!

1337
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:47,650
Oh, Spratt, Denker has told
me all about your column.

1338
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:49,890
Oh, well, I wouldn't have said anything

1339
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:52,610
but I thought her ladyship already knew.

1340
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,410
Believe that and you'll
believe anything. M'lady --

1341
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:59,450
In future, I shall come to you
for advice about my clothes,

1342
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,370
and my entertaining.

1343
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,930
Who knew we had an expert in the basement?

1344
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,010
- Well, I -- - Ladies
and gentlemen... - Ssh!

1345
01:24:07,060 --> 01:24:09,060
Speeches.

1346
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,210
You made a mistake, Miss Denker,
in your haste to be rid of me.

1347
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,540
- What was that?
- She never likes to be predictable.

1348
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:19,930
.. And I am a cousin of her father's...

1349
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:24,140
If you mean what you say, Daisy,
I shall drink a toast with gusto.

1350
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:27,140
I do, I'm coming to the farm.

1351
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,890
Then I hope we'll be seeing a lot
more of you there, too, Mrs Patmore.

1352
01:24:32,940 --> 01:24:35,880
- I don't know about that.
- I think you do.

1353
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:42,530
Oh, we ought to get up for the speeches.

1354
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,730
It gives me great pleasure to
bring down blessings on the head

1355
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:54,090
- of the beautiful Marchioness
Of Hexham. - Hear, hear.

1356
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:57,770
But first I should read a
telegram from her grandmother,

1357
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:00,740
the redoubtable Mrs Levinson.

1358
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,330
'I'm sorry I could not be with you.

1359
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:07,170
Although we pray for those
in peril on the sea,

1360
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,530
I am too old to be one of them.
God bless you both, Grandmama.'

1361
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,570
In a way I'm sorry she's not here.

1362
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:15,610
In a way.

1363
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:17,660
But not in every way.

1364
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,930
What a wonderful life we're going to have.

1365
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:22,170
I suppose this is all really happening?

1366
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:24,690
Edith and Bertie, bride and groom.

1367
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:27,700
To the bride and groom!

1368
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,810
- Shall I take a drink up for Mary?
- I daresay she'll need one.

1369
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,170
But her maid is giving birth
in her bedroom. How very modern!

1370
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:43,520
- It wasn't exactly planned.
- Which of our lives is?

1371
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,940
I should go up.

1372
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,660
Ooh, one for me.

1373
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:52,690
He's nice. Well, I wish you
luck with the business.

1374
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:54,490
Though you won't need it, of course.

1375
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:57,540
We all need luck, Miss
Evans, we all need luck.

1376
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,120
They're off! They're going!

1377
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:05,140
Ooh, I'll not miss this. Come on!

1378
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,930
We don't want to miss it.

1379
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,370
I'll try not to disappoint you.

1380
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:37,500
Just love him, I won't
be disappointed in that.

1381
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,460
Have a wonderful time, darling,
and don't worry about anything.

1382
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:49,940
It's so strange, I feel so
completely... completely happy.

1383
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:54,090
- I don't think I've ever felt that before.
- But you will now,

1384
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:56,140
for a long time to come.

1385
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:03,300
- Hurry, or you'll miss your train.
- Throw it, it's unlucky if you don't.

1386
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,780
Are you ready?

1387
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,690
Oh!

1388
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:15,810
Aren't you the lucky one?

1389
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,970
Congratulations. Have a wonderful time.

1390
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:24,100
Thank you, Miss.

1391
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:27,900
Goodbye.

1392
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,900
- You look lovely, my dear. All
the very best. - Thank you.

1393
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:36,420
See you soon.

1394
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:41,180
Bye, everyone!

1395
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,780
I hope you're not too unhappy about
the way things have turned out.

1396
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:50,020
Downton will be a very different
place without you at the helm.

1397
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:53,850
The world is a different place
from the way it was, my lord,

1398
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,570
and Downton Abbey must change with it.

1399
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,890
Make sure there's enough
to drink downstairs tonight,

1400
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,930
to see the New Year in.

1401
01:28:02,980 --> 01:28:06,650
May I take this opportunity
to wish you and your ladyship

1402
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,770
the happiest of New Years?

1403
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:13,460
No-one could pray for your good
fortune more heartily than I.

1404
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:17,520
We are very grateful to you, Carson.

1405
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,900
I hope you know that.

1406
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,690
Very grateful indeed.

1407
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:24,740
For everything.

1408
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:38,130
I'd like to go on working, m'lady,
if we can sort out the baby.

1409
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,890
We'll have him here in the
nursery during the day.

1410
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:44,010
To be followed by a young
Talbot in due course.

1411
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:46,060
And then we'll see.

1412
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:51,370
Oh, I've come to summon Lady
Mary and Mr Talbot downstairs

1413
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:53,410
to see the New Year in with us.

1414
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:56,740
- This is for you.
- Thank you, my lord, that's very kind.

1415
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,450
Is it that time already?

1416
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,540
- Did Edith get off all right?
- Oh, yes, hours ago.

1417
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,080
- Is this the new arrival?
- It is, my lady.

1418
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,960
I'm a father, and I have a son.

1419
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,780
We have a son, John.

1420
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,740
Congratulations to you both.

1421
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,090
I'm ever so sorry to be in here.

1422
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,130
We'll be gone as soon as she's able.

1423
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:26,260
Oh, don't worry about that. We
ought to go down. Happy New Year.

1424
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,570
I'm afraid Mama would
find it rather unorthodox.

1425
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:42,020
Maybe. But you know what I think?

1426
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,530
I think the more adaptable we are,

1427
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:47,650
- the more chance we have of
getting through. - We'll do it.

1428
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:51,210
The estate's safe in Mary's hands
with Henry and Tom to help her.

1429
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,450
Edith has risen from the
cinders in the hearth

1430
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,690
to be kissed by her
very own Prince Charming.

1431
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:57,740
What more can we ask?

1432
01:29:58,180 --> 01:30:02,210
A long and happy life together, just
we two, to watch the children grow.

1433
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:04,980
- That's all I want.
- And why not?

1434
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,160
We never know what's
coming, of course, who does?

1435
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:12,140
But I'd say we have a good chance.

1436
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:15,820
Quickly!

1437
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:20,770
Take these. We're nearly there.

1438
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:23,020
It was quite extraordinary...

1439
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,490
It's so good of you to stay, Mama.

1440
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,940
It's good of you to ask me, Cora.

1441
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:31,300
It is your kingdom now,

1442
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:33,700
your village,

1443
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:36,340
it is your hospital.

1444
01:30:37,180 --> 01:30:40,420
And... I think you run it very well.

1445
01:30:51,020 --> 01:30:54,810
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

1446
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:58,810
- Happy New Year, everybody.
- Happy New Year!

1447
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,450
- Happy New Year, Thomas.
- Happy New Year.

1448
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Happy New Year.

1449
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:09,780
Happy New Year.

1450
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:19,930
- It'll be a different life.
- But we can make a go of it, Charlie,

1451
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,180
and I definitely mean to try.

1452
01:31:24,260 --> 01:31:27,060
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Elsie.

1453
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:30,610
- Would you like some wine, Mrs Hughes?
- Yes, Mr Barrow, thank you.

1454
01:31:30,660 --> 01:31:34,450
- Happy New Year. - And Year to you,
Mrs Hughes. - Thank you, Mr Barrow.

1455
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,650
Happy New Year.

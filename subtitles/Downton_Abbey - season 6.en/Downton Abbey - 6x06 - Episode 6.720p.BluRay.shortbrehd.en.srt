1
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,470
Oh, let me give you one of those.

2
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,390
Can I give you one of those?
It's an open day at the Abbey.

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,110
Please come along, in aid
of the hospital trust.

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,470
- Hello, sir, might I offer you one of those?
- Thank you very much.

5
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,720
Please bring the family.
Would you like one of those?

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,510
But what are they paying to
see? We have nothing to show 'em.

7
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,760
A decent Reynolds, a couple
of Romneys and a Winterhalter.

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,710
That's your lot. They'd do better

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,800
- Taking a train for London
and visiting the Tate.
- That's not the point.

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,870
People want to see a different sort
of home. It's not the things in it.

11
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,750
- How the other half lives?
- If you like. There's curiosity.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,230
- Dr Clarkson, what do you feel?
- Keeping people healthy takes a lot

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,600
of money in this day and age. We
could raise more than you think.

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,150
Robert, we are opening
for one day for charity,

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,430
and there's an end to it. Mary
and Tom have made the decision.

16
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,190
Ah. I know well enough
that when Mary has spoken,

17
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,310
my opinion has little
bearing on the matter.

18
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,350
You don't really mind, do you?

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,760
No, but I think it's crackers.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,950
I don't like it. Poking and
prying around the house.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,390
What's to stop them slipping the odd
first edition into their back pockets?

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,750
You've a very poor opinion
of your fellow man.

23
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,030
I have the opinion that
life has taught me.

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,240
But I don't see why anyone would
pay good money to come and look.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,590
- You're not curious about how
other people live. - No. I'm not.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,480
And if you'd the chance to see the private
rooms of the King and Queen, would you pay?

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,320
But what would it tell me? They sleep
in a bed, they eat at a table. So do I.

28
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,000
I always wonder whether someone else
is having a better time than I am.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,800
But that's what's so dangerous. You
think they must be having a better time.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,950
Then you want them not
to have a better time.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,230
- The next thing you know, there's a guillotine
in Trafalgar Square. - Ever the optimist (!)

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,950
I think all these houses
should be open to the public.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,550
What gives them the
right to keep people out?

34
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,790
The law of property,
which is the cornerstone

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,190
of any civilisation worthy of the name.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,350
Well, to me, it could be a good thing.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,400
To let them enjoy fine craftsmanship
and beautiful paintings.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,950
But then, of course, they're
bound to start asking,

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,190
"Why have the Crawleys got
all of this and I haven't?"

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,440
Thank you, Mr Molesley. I
couldn't have put it better myself.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
But why have they, Mr Carson?

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,560
How is your job search going, Mr Barrow?

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,480
But why should anyone pay to
see a perfectly ordinary house?

44
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,950
Not everyone lives in a
house like Downton Abbey.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,720
Oh, roll up, roll up, visit
an actual dining room!

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,160
Complete with a real
life table and chairs!

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,240
People have always tipped the
butler to look 'round a house.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Even Elizabeth Bennett wanted to
see what Pemberly was like inside.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,190
A decision which caused her a
great deal of embarrassment,

50
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,070
if I remember the novel correctly.

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,790
And what about Robert?
He's still very ill.

52
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,830
He's on the mend. It's
been a few weeks now.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,230
- And Cora's very competent.
- Mmm, yes, she's competent.

54
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,200
Leading a revolution
without turning a hair.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,950
Anyway, it's agreed. Downton Abbey
will open to the public for one day.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,950
Dr Clarkson is very grateful.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,960
Clarkson was there? Oh,
so he really has weakened.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
I prefer to think he
has begun to see sense.

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,960
You believe that? Even after Robert's life

60
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,840
was saved by a hospital being nearby?

61
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,870
You think that changes things,
but as Lord Merton pointed out,

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,990
Robert would have been treated
there even after the hand-over.

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,240
Oh? How is Lord Merton?

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,350
As he always is.

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,920
And you? You weakening?

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,020
No.

67
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,320
- No!
- Mmm.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,110
Who was it?

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,480
Bertie Pelham. He's going to be in London
on the 11th, and he wanted to meet up.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,510
Why don't you ask him to stop in here
on his way back to Northumberland?

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,990
- If you'd like to.
- I would rather.

72
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,270
- Is he worth it?
- As opposed to your car mechanic?

73
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,590
I'm a car mechanic, thank you.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,680
We're opening the house that
weekend. He may have some ideas.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,900
Well, I'll ask him.

76
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,350
I should go.

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm late as it is. I'll be back tomorrow.

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,720
Don't feel you must look in every day.
You should be working for your exams.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,070
- It can't be long now.
- Not too long, no.

80
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
Are you nervous? I should be.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,560
I do know it. The question is, can
I summon it up when the time comes?

82
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,390
- Where are you taking them?
- The school.

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,840
The headmaster will oversee it. Mr
Molesley's settling the details.

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,960
- You owe him a great deal.
- I know. But he's enjoyed it, too.

85
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
Oh.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,870
- This is for Mrs Patmore.
- What is it?

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,260
A note to thank her. I'm grateful.

88
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,720
- She already knows that.
- It never hurts to say it.

89
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,080
You don't want to encourage her.
She's too curious for her own good.

90
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,580
Just give her the note.

91
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,760
Oh. This is good of you.

92
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,590
You should've let one of
the footmen bring it up.

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,160
I wanted to see how you are, My Lord,

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,840
and... I thought you
might fancy some of this.

95
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,550
Crumbs. That looks frightening.

96
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,960
It's, uh, a little Chateau
Chasse-Spleen, My Lord.

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,990
I put it in this for ease of carriage.

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,380
Chasse Spleen? Now you're talking.

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,870
I believe it was a
favourite of Lord Byron's.

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,000
He knew a thing or two
about wine. And women.

101
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,640
But do you know, Carson, I think
I'm going to have to say no.

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,270
- Really, my Lord?
- I'm afraid so.

103
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,480
Sometimes in life
sacrifices have to be made,

104
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,990
and I think the time has
come for me to accept

105
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,070
that I cannot go on as I used to.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,470
I am very sorry to hear
you say so, My Lord.

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,880
Not as sorry as I am.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,480
And speaking of necessary sacrifices, I've
been thinking about things, lying here.

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,590
We must get on with
simplifying the household.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,920
I know we've talked about it,
but we haven't really done much.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
Oh, the new maids live in the
village, and so cost a lot less.

112
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,990
And we only have one
groom and a stable boy.

113
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,920
But we still have an under butler and
two footmen. In this day and age.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,040
I do believe that Mr Barrow has genuinely
been looking for other employment.

115
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
But not finding it. Is there
anything we can do to help?

116
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,310
I'll speak to him, My Lord.

117
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,110
What do you think of the plan
to open the house for a day?

118
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,030
I think it's a dangerous
precedent, since you ask,

119
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,710
but I'm not sure how useful
it is of me to say so.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,310
Dangerous? I think it's idiotic.

121
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,230
It adds up to the same thing, My Lord.

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,670
- It's a mistake. I suppose it's too
late to stop it now. - Far too late.

123
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,920
But what on earth can we show them to give them
their money's worth? Lady Grantham knitting?

124
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,120
Lady Mary in the bath?

125
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
What's this?

126
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,510
Oh, it's addressed to me.

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,680
Oh, it's from Mr Mason.

128
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,190
- How did it get there?
- I wondered where I'd put it.

129
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,590
- He asked me to give you it.
- Well, why didn't you, then?

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,120
I couldn't find it. It must have
fallen in the rubbish by mistake.

131
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,710
- Why had it been opened?
- Had it?

132
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,000
Whatever happened to that man?
Do you know what his sentence was?

133
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,040
- Ten years, m'lady.
- Ten years? My goodness.

134
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,440
I know. I'm glad in a way I didn't
have to testify against him now.

135
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,940
Good night, Baxter.

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,800
Are you here? What time is it?

137
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,080
It's late. Go back to sleep.

138
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,030
I think we ought to ask
Mama to come and see me.

139
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,600
- She must be feeling rather left out.
- Her mind is on other things.

140
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
She's hoping your operation will
persuade people over to her side.

141
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I would have died if I'd
had to be taken to York.

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,760
But they'd still operate here in
an emergency, so nothing's changed.

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,230
Well, let's not make it worse.

144
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,380
I'm afraid it must get worse
before it gets better.

145
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,230
What about a fire?

146
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,310
It's a bit indulgent, but we've earned it.

147
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,840
- Not for me. I'm going to bed.
- You're not feeling ill, are you?

148
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,310
Anna, if you're not
well, you must tell me.

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,270
We've finished with this business
of your keeping me in the dark.

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,950
- I'm not ill exactly.
- Have you told Lady Mary?

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,670
- I didn't like to bother her. - Bother her
first thing. - I could tell Dr Clarkson.

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,430
No. You're seeing Dr Ryder
if you're seeing anybody.

153
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,190
Don't be silly. We can't afford that.

154
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,560
- I can't expect Lady Mary to keep shelling out.
- I'll pay. I have savings.

155
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,590
- We're selling a house, aren't we?
- Yes. To buy another house.

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,710
Now you're the one being
silly. Talk to her tomorrow.

157
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,230
She'll agree with me. And I'm paying.

158
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,550
I wouldn't mind having
breakfast here sometimes.

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,240
- Not every day, but sometimes.
- I don't think anyone would object.

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,070
How are you at making coffee?

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,470
I can make coffee. It's not very hard.

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,720
That's where you're wrong.
There's quite an art to it.

163
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,900
Uh, you might like to have
a word with Mrs Patmore.

164
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,230
Of course. If you'd like me to.

165
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,880
And I want to start bringing
things a little more up to standard.

166
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,110
I wonder if we could have the
hall boy to do some polishing.

167
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,950
I don't see why not.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
And you might ask one of the
maids about making the bed.

169
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,040
- Isn't that good enough, either?
- It's not bad. I didn't mean that.

170
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,760
But I do like those sharp corners.

171
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,680
Well. I'm glad it's not bad.

172
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,790
I wish you'd told me before.

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,520
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- What does Bates say?

174
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,940
He wants me to see Dr Ryder again.

175
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,320
He wants to pay, but it
seems an extravagance to me.

176
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,940
I'm happy to talk to Dr Clarkson.

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,990
No, let's go to London. I'm
sure Dr Clarkson could manage it,

178
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,670
- but I feel like a jaunt.
- And stay the night?

179
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,510
With Lady Rosamund. Pack
something for the evening.

180
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,430
Medium smart. I'll make
some telephone calls.

181
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,520
- I got your message. What's happened?
- I'll ring for some coffee.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,310
You sound as if you should
ring for some smelling salts.

183
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,430
If you mean is it serious, it is.

184
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,110
- I received a letter this morning
from the Board of Governors. - Go on.

185
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,310
They are going to combine us with York.

186
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,320
- As we knew they must.
- Indeed. I am to remain in my post here.

187
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,110
- Good. - Mrs Crawley is
to stay on as our almoner.

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,510
- Very sensible.
- But they want to offer

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,510
- the role of president to you.
- Me? Why?

190
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,030
You made a good impression
when you went into York.

191
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,550
I don't understand. What about Mama?

192
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,320
Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,

193
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,680
"Allowed to step down after so
many years of noble service."

194
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,630
Golly. They've sacked the Captain.

195
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,790
You can see their point. How could they have
someone in the management of the new system

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,390
who thinks the whole idea
is a horrible mistake?

197
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,950
- And you support this notion?
- Of course he does.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,030
He put your name forward as replacement.

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,230
Lady Grantham is not as young as she was,

200
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,680
- and, as Mrs Crawley says, I'm
afraid she'd be almost willing the
new regime to fail. - Probably.

201
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,720
Besides, I want to involve the new president
in the logistics of running things.

202
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,070
And she would never have
agreed to take that on.

203
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,510
So, I'm to step into her
shoes and then be given

204
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,310
more responsibility than she had?

205
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,700
We both think you'd be marvellous.

206
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,350
And who's going to tell her?

207
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
They'll write, as soon
as they hear back from me.

208
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,470
I need to talk to Lord Grantham.

209
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,270
The thing is, we don't want someone
to come up with another name.

210
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,280
Don't we? It might be easier
all round if they did.

211
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,770
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.

212
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,490
Don't tell him it's me.

213
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,490
I want to be the surprise guest.

214
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,740
Oh, you'll think of something.

215
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,540
All right, bye.

216
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,450
So this is the urgent business
that takes m'lady to London town?

217
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,930
- It's not the only thing.
- But it is getting serious.

218
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,210
Dinner with Evelyn
Napier at the Criterion?

219
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,810
Doesn't sound very serious to me.

220
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,770
I used to go to the
Criterion with Michael.

221
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,290
Do you have to put a damper on
every restaurant in the capital?

222
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,610
As a matter of fact, I have
very happy memories of it.

223
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,970
Send him my best wishes. I
hope to see him again soon.

224
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,250
Oh, Evelyn? Yes, send him my love, too.

225
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,840
Evelyn or whoever else might be there.

226
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,330
Why don't you come with me?
It'll be fun. I dare you.

227
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,730
- You haven't been anywhere in ages.
- All right. I'll go and pack.

228
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,690
We can't be too long. I want to be
sure we're ready for the opening.

229
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,370
Oh, we've masses of time for
that. We'll be home tomorrow.

230
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,610
Edith, you can manage for a
day without us, can't you?

231
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,660
I can manage without you
for as long as you want.

232
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,850
- Why don't you come with us? - And watch
Mary flirt with her oily driver? No, thank you.

233
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,380
- Can't you be pleased for her?
- I'm as pleased for her as she would be for me.

234
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,290
Barrow, you mustn't let him wear you out.

235
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,210
Oh, he's all right, m'lady. Aren't you?

236
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,610
- I was cheering him up.
- That's not what it looked like.

237
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,690
Do you need cheering up, Barrow?

238
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,080
We all need it sometimes, m'lady.

239
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,660
I mean it, George. You must let
Mr Barrow get on with his work.

240
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,290
Again, again...

241
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,140
All right. And off we go!

242
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,900
We're off. I'm taking Tom.
It's time he had a break.

243
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,660
Oh, I envy you. I'm so sick
of this room, I could scream.

244
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,740
Barrow was in the gallery, looking
rather glum. Do we know why?

245
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,940
We've talked about making
changes in the household.

246
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,010
Carson and I both feel
he's the obvious candidate.

247
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,570
You're not going to sack him?

248
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,730
I hope not. I hope he's
going to find another job.

249
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,300
Oh. I see. Well, that explains it.

250
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,290
He's awfully sweet with
George and the girls.

251
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,100
- You do know that? - And when
George is older, he can ask him back.

252
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,810
Goodbye, darling.

253
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,500
- Get some rest.
- Rest.

254
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,890
Don't worry, Bates.
We'll have her home soon.

255
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,810
I don't think there'll be anything
to concern ourselves about.

256
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,450
Anna has an appointment this evening.

257
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,370
I'll telephone you
after. Mr Mead won't mind.

258
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm very grateful to you,
m'lady, for arranging it,

259
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,530
but Anna will ask him to send me the bill.

260
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,900
Dr Ryder was my idea, not yours.

261
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,060
And it was a good idea, m'lady.
An idea that has brought us

262
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,010
to within shouting distance
of our greatest happiness.

263
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,730
But I can pay my way, and I'd
be more comfortable to do so.

264
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,340
Very well. We won't fight about it.

265
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,020
- Will you miss me? - I miss you when
you're out of sight, never mind London.

266
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,740
I'm glad to hear it, Mr Bates.

267
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,780
I won't let them send him the bill.

268
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,660
That's not kind. His pride is more
important to him than the money.

269
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,610
Thank you, Mr Branson.

270
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,420
Mr Barrow, in 20 years' time,

271
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,250
I doubt there's one footman
working at Downton.

272
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,380
Lady Edith already manages without her
own maid, and if Anna were to leave,

273
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,380
I doubt that Lady Mary would replace her.

274
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,540
- It's not just you.
- But I am the first.

275
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,860
But you are the under butler,

276
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,820
a post that is fragrant with
memories of a lost world.

277
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,860
No-one is sorrier to say it than I am,

278
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,460
- but you are not a creature of today.
- And you are?

279
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,780
I don't believe that a house like
Downton could be run without a butler.

280
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
In that sense, yes, I am.

281
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,500
- Oh, you're busy.
- No, no. We're finished, Mrs Hughes.

282
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,740
Or at least one of us is.

283
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,060
Good day, Mr Carson.

284
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,060
I thought we might have our
dinner at the cottage tonight.

285
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,620
- If you like. - Perhaps you could
get some guidance from Mrs Patmore?

286
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,050
It doesn't have to be
anything very complicated.

287
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,740
Doesn't it? That's a relief.

288
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,490
I'll give you the date
as soon as I have it.

289
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,210
Right. I'm quite excited. How mad is that?

290
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,850
Can Mrs Patmore spare Daisy for the day?

291
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,290
For it will be the whole
day. There are six papers.

292
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,580
Oh, they'll spare her. Everyone
there thinks she's taking the right
step. Especially Her Ladyship.

293
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,060
I hope they appreciate your role
in all this. You've been very kind.

294
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,900
Well, I think it's because I
missed the boat that I feel

295
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,650
it's so important for others to catch it.

296
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,940
Mr Molesley, I've had an idea.

297
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,370
- What would you say to
helping me out? - What?

298
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,730
I'm not necessarily
suggesting you might teach.

299
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,610
I need a clearer idea of what you know.

300
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,890
But I like your respect for education.

301
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,020
I like your enthusiasm, and I
want to harness it if I can.

302
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,410
Oh, I don't know what to say.

303
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,500
First you can decide if you'd
sit a test of my own devising,

304
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,730
of general knowledge as much as anything.

305
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,700
This is kind of you, Mama, but
as you can see, I'm miles better.

306
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,740
I assumed it was a good sign that
I hadn't been summoned in haste.

307
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Anyway, I'm here and I'm glad
of the chance to talk about

308
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,460
this mad scheme of opening the house.

309
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,650
It's all fixed, Mama. By Mary.

310
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,620
Well, why anyone would come
beats me, but, since it is,

311
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,140
should I cut a ribbon when
the doors are flung open?

312
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,290
Uh, well...

313
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,860
As president of the hospital,
I ought to have a formal role.

314
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,770
That is why we are raising funds.

315
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,620
I don't believe we need a ceremony.
The doors will be open from 9:00.
Who'd want to get here for then?

316
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,100
- Well, it wouldn't kill me.
- No, but it might kill us.

317
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,580
Oh, well, let me know what you decide.

318
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,620
The patients are my priority.

319
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,060
As president, I am their
representative on earth.

320
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,090
I have a feeling your
collapse will have changed

321
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,300
a lot of people's minds
about the so-called reforms.

322
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,900
Don't worry. I shall be
magnanimous in victory.

323
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,090
Is everything ready for tonight?

324
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,740
I think so. You're not
expecting a banquet, are you?

325
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm expecting a delicious dinner
prepared by the fair hands

326
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,980
of my beautiful wife.

327
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,050
There's a threat in there somewhere.

328
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,060
I don't understand. He wants you
to sit the exam as well as Daisy?

329
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,580
Oh, no. Not matric. He wants
to assess my general knowledge.

330
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,860
- With a view to...
- He wasn't very specific.

331
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,820
I'd guess he didn't want to make
a promise he might have to break.

332
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,610
Are you going to take the test?

333
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,540
If Mr Carson gives me the time
off. What have I got to lose?

334
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,490
We'll meet upstairs after our
dinner. My room or yours?

335
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,580
- I don't mind.
- Mine, then. The lighting's better.

336
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,730
You're back. I thought I was
going to have to dress myself.

337
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,450
I am so sorry, m'lady. Only,
I could not get a bus.

338
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,330
Never mind. What did he say?

339
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,060
It's fine. Standard pregnancy pain.
Something to do with the ligament,

340
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,330
- but don't ask me what.
- I won't.

341
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,900
He gave me exercises and suggested
a warm towel if it lingers,

342
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,930
but it's just the body adjusting.

343
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,340
I don't think ligaments were invented
when I was having Master George.

344
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,170
Master George does make me laugh.

345
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,050
He rules Mr Barrow with a rod of iron.

346
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,450
Yes, Barrow's rather
sweet with the children.

347
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,570
Do you think he's trying
to get in with us?

348
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,740
I'd say he's genuine, m'lady. I
doubt he'll have any children of
his own, and he enjoys their company.

349
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,980
Miss Marigold's fitted
in surprisingly well.

350
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,620
- Yes, but then they're all...
- They're all what?

351
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,970
They're all clever and pleasant.

352
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,610
What were you going to say?

353
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,770
Just what I did say, m'lady.

354
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,730
Now, has Mr Talbot found
out you're coming tonight?

355
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,530
No. I suppose I should
have jumped out of a cake.

356
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,580
But then you'd have to wait for
the pudding before you saw him.

357
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,740
I must give Clarkson an answer, or
Mama will find out some other way,

358
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,890
before the letter arrives.

359
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,060
This is a secret, Baxter.

360
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,460
- Of course. Will that be all?
- Yes, thank you.

361
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,920
That was high risk.

362
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,570
Not really. She won't talk.

363
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,500
- Anyway, it'll be public soon.
- I suppose you want to accept?

364
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,420
I do. But not if it will upset you.

365
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,600
Mama's the one who'll be
upset when she's deposed.

366
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,180
Although the fact you're the
usurper who's stolen her throne

367
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,890
- will clearly make it worse.
- But if that wasn't an element?

368
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,410
I only worry if it's too much for you.

369
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,170
It sounds as if Clarkson
almost wants you to work there.

370
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,860
So?

371
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,760
I've had one career already,
bringing up my daughters.

372
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,610
They don't need me now,
so I'm ready for the next.

373
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,100
The girls still need you. But
anyway, isn't it time for a rest?

374
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,050
- You're not like Isobel.
- In what way?

375
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,440
I only mean you don't need a job.

376
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,290
I don't think she needs a
job. I think she wants a job.

377
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,410
She enjoys it, so would I.

378
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,330
- I'm not old, Robert.
- I didn't say you were.

379
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,860
Didn't you?

380
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,830
If Anna says she doesn't know
anything, I'm sure she doesn't.

381
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,590
Why must there be something to know?

382
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,920
If I find out you knew and didn't
tell me, I'd be terribly upset.

383
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,430
- I'd see it as a real betrayal.
- Don't say that.

384
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,430
So you are in on it.

385
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,470
- Welcome. - Evelyn!
- My hand is complete.

386
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,550
Darling.

387
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,110
Heavens. We are quite a party.

388
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,840
You know Lady Anne Acland,
Mrs Dupper and Mrs McVeigh?

389
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,070
Anne and I shared a governess,
and Jill and I came out together.

390
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,270
Small world. You know Henry Talbot, and I
think you met Charlie Rogers up at Brancaster.

391
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,160
- We've met again since then.
- This is Mary's brother-in-law, Tom Branson.

392
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,380
- Hello.
- You're over here.

393
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,960
I shall read lots into your wanting
to be a surprise. Am I right?

394
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,270
A table of singletons
at our age, well done.

395
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,660
Single now, we're all war widows.

396
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,960
I am not a war widow. Good
to see you again, Mr Rogers.

397
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,790
You, too. Although I haven't
been allowed to forget you.

398
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,910
Henry talks of nothing and nobody else.

399
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,230
Oh, I didn't think he knew
enough about me for that.

400
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,880
- Tell me, are you pleased with your
progress this season? - I certainly am.

401
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,680
- We're both driving at Brooklands next month.
- In the car you tested in Yorkshire?

402
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,350
Exactly. See? We'll get
you interested yet.

403
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,630
- No, you won't.
- Well, you've got me interested.

404
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,030
- Would you want to come?
- I don't get down to London much.

405
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,430
Well, you're here tonight. Why not come
specially? Watch from the pits with the team.

406
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,960
- Yes, I think you'd enjoy it.
- I know I'd enjoy it. Mary?

407
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,550
- Tom, you should go if you like.
- And what about you?

408
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,640
Well, I don't keep my diary in
my head. Ask me nearer the time.

409
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,990
How are we doing?

410
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,630
Ah, what is it?

411
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,880
Um, Glenvere smoked salmon, from
last night's upstairs dinner.

412
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,710
- Lemon?
- Oh.

413
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,350
- I don't believe it.
- What?

414
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,320
Mrs Patmore gave me two lemons, and
I left them on the kitchen table.

415
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
I'll tell you what would be
nice with this. Some horseradish,

416
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,960
thinned with a little soured cream.

417
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,480
I agree. That would be heavenly.
Except that we don't have any.

418
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,110
- Ah.
- What are we drinking with it?

419
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,630
The thing is, I don't
think we should drink.

420
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,150
Not if His Lordship feels
obliged to give it up.

421
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,360
But His Lordship is suffering
from a burst ulcer. We're not.

422
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,990
I know, I know. But
somehow it feels disloyal.

423
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,910
He is my officer, and I
should follow his lead.

424
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,060
- And it won't make you grumpy?
- I don't think so.

425
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,960
What's next?

426
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
- Duck.
- Oh.

427
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,190
Is the skin crispy like Mrs Patmore
does it? Did you ask her advice?

428
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,150
We certainly talked about what
it's like to cook dinner for you.

429
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,140
- Ah, I bet she had a lot to say.
- We both did.

430
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,470
- Good night. Shall I get us a taxi?
- Well, it's such a lovely night.

431
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,510
Why don't I walk you back?
Where are you based?

432
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,750
We're staying with my
aunt in Belgrave Square.

433
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,900
- Perfect. What do you say?
- I think it'd be nice.

434
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,120
Except I have a lot of reading to do,
so I might just go straight back.

435
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,590
- Only if you're sure, Tom.
- I'm sure.

436
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,950
- He'd better be sure.
- Well, I hope we meet again.

437
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,960
Perhaps at Brooklands. You'd have a good
time. It's really quite swanky these days.

438
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,350
How enchanting you make it sound.

439
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,310
Goodbye, Evelyn.

440
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,640
- You're a darling.
- Shall we?

441
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,110
I hope you will come south next month.

442
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,480
Partly to watch me driving of course,
but mainly so that I can see you.

443
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,590
- And I know you're not interested in racing.
- It's not only that.

444
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,990
I don't know why I haven't
told you before now,

445
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,150
but...

446
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,390
Matthew died in a car crash.

447
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,990
Yes, I know. Evelyn told me.

448
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,590
- So you understand.
- Of course I understand.

449
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,680
The car is your enemy. But it's my friend,

450
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,120
and all I ask is that you
give it a second chance.

451
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,400
After all, it's not as if you're
driving around in a Hansom cab.

452
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,440
Excellent. Um, in here.

453
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,480
Heavens, Mr Talbot. Is this
part of your plan to convince me?

454
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,190
Look. You don't have
to if you don't want to.

455
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
- Plenty of drivers' wives never
go near the race track. - Wives?

456
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,830
I only meant that if we do get involved,

457
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,990
it doesn't have to be part of the plan.

458
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,830
It's not compulsory.

459
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,030
But you'd like me there to watch?

460
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,000
Yes, but only so I can be near you.

461
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,230
Henry, to be honest,

462
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,990
this is moving much
faster than I'd imagined.

463
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,280
Look, I know I'm not what you're after.

464
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,200
My prospects are modest
at best, and you...

465
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,880
Well, you're a great catch.

466
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:10,800
But you're also a woman that I
happen to be falling in love with.

467
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,910
Gosh, that sounds rather
feeble, doesn't it?

468
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,720
No, not at all. As an argument,
I think it's rather compelling.

469
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,200
- Thank you.
- Mmm.

470
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,670
It doesn't show any signs of stopping.

471
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,920
- No.
- Should we run for it?

472
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,400
Well, you're the boss.

473
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,040
Come on. Careful.

474
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,110
- Were you caught in the rain?
- Not too badly.

475
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,100
We dashed for cover till
it slackened off a bit.

476
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,110
- How romantic.
- Why are you playing Cupid?

477
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,630
He's nice, he's mad about you and
he loves cars. I rest my case.

478
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,430
I don't see how it would work.

479
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,950
Why? He'll have to settle down eventually, go
into business. Why couldn't he do it from Downton?

480
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,030
- I know...
- He won't be as rich as you.

481
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,750
He won't be as rich as your child.

482
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,300
But he's a gentleman. And if
I say that, it must be true.

483
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,840
- Would you like a drink?
- Just a tiny glass of whisky and water.

484
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,550
- When does Edith's beau arrive?
- Friday.

485
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,750
- Just in time to interfere with the opening.
- I liked him when we met.

486
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,240
- He seemed a decent sort.
- But boring to an Olympic degree.

487
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,380
If Edith's happy, it
improves things for everyone.

488
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,990
She's so stupid to have
saddled herself with a child.

489
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,480
I mean, Marigold's sweet, but why
would any man want to take her on?

490
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,500
I thought you'd forgotten me.

491
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,870
Thank God I've found you.

492
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,630
The car wouldn't start, so I
had to get Stark to do it.

493
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,630
I'm glad I don't have to walk
the whole length of the drive.

494
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,020
- Hop in.
- I will. But first...

495
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,920
That feels so nice and automatic.

496
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,200
- Which is good?
- It is for me.

497
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,670
I hope you don't mind my taking a chance,

498
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,720
but I got your letter and
I wanted to discuss it.

499
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,830
This is Miss Cruikshank.
She's engaged to Larry.

500
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,560
- Yes. I saw it in the papers.
- I know I've rather pushed in,

501
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,150
- but I did so want to meet you.
- Does your fiance know you're here?

502
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,110
I gather you and he haven't exactly
seen eye to eye in the past.

503
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,630
Not exactly, no.

504
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,440
As you can imagine, I was amazed
and very pleased when she asked
if she could join me to pay a call.

505
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,350
You mustn't blame him.
It was completely my idea.

506
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,880
Mmm. Well, life is full of surprises.

507
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,000
- I know you and Larry rather got off on the
wrong foot. - That's one way of describing it.

508
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,360
Well, please know not all of Lord
Merton's family feel the same way.

509
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,700
Goodness.

510
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,660
After that, I don't know if I
can concentrate on business.

511
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,510
I wondered if old Lady Grantham
had received the letter.

512
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,200
Not that I've heard of. Although Dr Clarkson
has told them that Cora is happy to serve.

513
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,590
Uh, only we're coming to the house
opening on Saturday to support it.

514
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,710
Well, don't say anything if you see her.

515
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,600
I hate things like this. We'll all come
off very badly when she does find out.

516
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,350
- I'm afraid that's
probably true. - Mmm.

517
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,310
It's odd to think you'll be sitting
side by side, writing exams.

518
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,430
Well, my paper won't be
anything like as long as Daisy's.

519
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,430
- She's got six to do.
- Thanks.

520
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,310
I admire you, Daisy. To give
yourself a second chance.

521
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,550
When the time comes,
Daisy'll need some lunch.

522
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,470
- Maybe I will, as well.
- Well, I've thought of that.

523
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,510
I'll do lunch for Mr Dawes, too.

524
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,400
You could ask Mr Mason to join
you on the day. He'd enjoy that.

525
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,750
Don't bother him, not when
he's got so much work to do.

526
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,040
I'll tell him as soon as we have a
date. See if he'd like to look in.

527
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,270
I don't understand why you
can't just leave him alone.

528
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,040
- Daisy, that's not very gracious.
- Well, I don't!

529
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,470
It's nerves. She's worked
long enough for this moment.

530
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,390
It's partially nerves, yes.

531
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,040
But I don't think it's all nerves.
And I will write a note to Mr Mason.

532
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,270
This is nice. Now we can go down together.

533
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,830
- Less nervous making.
- Absolutely.

534
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,430
But I was going to look
into the night nursery first.

535
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,760
- Can I come?
- Of course.

536
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,880
Good evening, Nanny.

537
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,950
- This is Mr Pelham.
- Good evening, sir.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,110
- Good evening.
- M'lady, could you be here

539
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,320
- while I just run down to
the sewing room? - Of course.

540
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,350
This is Mary's son, George,

541
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,120
and my late sister
Sybil's daughter, Sybbie.

542
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,470
And this is Marigold.

543
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,520
God bless you, Marigold.

544
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,060
What a lovely place this is to grow up.

545
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,600
I hope so.

546
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,990
I'm an experienced housemaid and a
housekeeper for how many years? And
he doesn't think I can make a bed.

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,830
Well, you always knew he was
old to be trained as a husband.

548
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,030
- Good evening.
- What are you doing here?

549
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,510
I thought I'd look in.

550
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,760
- What's that for? - I brought these
to say thank you to Mrs Patmore.

551
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,160
- You've already said thank you.
- That's very nice of you, Mr Mason.

552
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,030
Why bother? Have you seen
the kitchen gardens here?

553
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
There's enough vegetables to feed an
army. You need 'em more than we do.

554
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,760
Oh, never mind her, Mr Mason.
I think it's a lovely thing,

555
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,550
to have fresh farm vegetables just for me.

556
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,160
I'll make soup and stock and all sorts.

557
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,830
Well...

558
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,750
I'll leave you to it.

559
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,390
You've probably thought of
this, but I'd place someone,

560
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,630
maybe a servant, in each
room the public will enter.

561
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,470
- Just to keep an eye on things.
- Literally.

562
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,350
- I think that's a good idea.
- Carson, can you sort it out?

563
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,560
Of course, m'lady. I understand
it's only the ground floor.

564
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,550
And not too much of that. They'll
start in the small library,

565
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,990
then through the big library,
into the painted room,

566
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,310
the drawing room, the smoking
room, the great hall,

567
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,150
in and out of the dining
room and back outside.

568
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,750
Rope off across the
staircases and the back wing.

569
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,670
Who are the guides?

570
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,800
Do we need guides? Can't they just
have a look and leave it at that?

571
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,920
I don't think so. Not if you
want them to go away happy,

572
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,110
and leave behind what's not theirs.

573
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,350
Who knows about the history of the house?

574
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,600
Only our librarian, Mr
Pattinson, but he's away.

575
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,640
You'll have to fake it. Lady
Mary, Edith, Mr Branson...

576
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,880
Not me. I don't know a thing.
I'll sell tickets, but that's it.

577
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,280
Well, then, Lady Grantham, you and your
daughters can take parties of 10 each,

578
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,590
with no more than 30 in
the house at any one time.

579
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,150
- Crikey.
- Heavens.

580
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,270
I feel like the Belgians
waiting for the invasion.

581
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,360
Or the monkeys in a zoo.

582
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,590
- Do you all know your positions?
- Are we allowed to sit, Mr Carson?

583
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,440
Well, the place will
be open for nine hours.

584
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,230
Find an inconspicuous chair in the corner,

585
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,960
but keep a sharp eye out and stand
if any member of the family comes in.

586
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,430
What about the upstairs luncheon?

587
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,040
- Sandwiches in Her Ladyship's room.
- We'll set up two of the tea tables.

588
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,240
Mr Molesley can serve, and his place
in the hall will be taken by Daisy.

589
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,590
And look respectable.

590
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,040
Right.

591
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,030
Do you know where my walking stick is?

592
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,790
I thought I might equip
myself with it for tomorrow.

593
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,990
In case you catch a thief red-handed?

594
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,320
You never know. But
it's not at the cottage.

595
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,910
And I wonder if it might have
got left behind in my wardrobe.

596
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,320
- He knows a lot about everything.
- The trouble is, I think he does.

597
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,710
- Did you enjoy our London spree?
- I did.

598
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,470
Have you decided if you're coming
to Brooklands? I will if you will.

599
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,990
I know I won't enjoy it one
bit, but at the same time...

600
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,750
- You'd like to see him again.
- It's not that.

601
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,230
I could see him for a walk in the park.

602
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,680
No, I suppose I want to get
over it. To get over myself.

603
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,840
He asked me if I'd give cars
another chance. Perhaps I should.

604
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,950
Who is this flexible
and reasonable person?

605
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,740
I don't recognise my
own dear sister, Mary.

606
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,790
- Could this be love?
- Oh, shut up.

607
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,560
He seems nice, and he's certainly
organised. Tom was quite jealous.

608
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,040
But what are his prospects? An
agent stuck up in Northumberland

609
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,750
managing someone else's estate?

610
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,630
What are Edith's prospects?

611
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,880
Oh, I don't know. With her magazine,
I think she could develop into

612
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,070
one of the interesting women of the day.

613
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,640
Ten years ago, that very idea
would have filled you with horror.

614
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,630
I've changed, you've
changed, the world's changed.

615
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,680
He is a gentleman. You can't
object to him on that score.

616
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,750
If she loves him, I don't
object to him on any score.

617
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,310
But I don't think we should encourage it.

618
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,990
She took him to meet Marigold,
but she didn't tell him why.

619
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,630
- Nor should she.
- She must eventually.

620
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,220
Let her make that decision for herself.

621
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,720
Now, you need some sleep before
your hideous day tomorrow.

622
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,040
Andrew? What were you
doing in Mr Barrow's room?

623
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,520
We were... I was borrowing a book.

624
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,350
What book? Where is it?

625
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,520
I left it there. I'll get it in the
morning. Good night, Mr Carson.

626
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,430
Oh, Andrew, Andrew, place
the table here, please.

627
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Yes, Mr Carson.

628
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,660
Thank you, Mr Molesley.

629
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm sorry for the wait, can
you form parties of 10?

630
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,720
We've been here since 9:00.

631
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,310
You are in the next group.

632
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,760
No, the third Earl built it.

633
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,040
Well, he didn't really build
it so much as envelope it,

634
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,720
because this room is originally medieval.

635
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,110
It was the monks' refectory of an abbey

636
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,200
that King Henry sold after the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.

637
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,940
Is that why it's called Downton Abbey?

638
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,840
I guess so.

639
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,590
Who painted that?

640
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,680
I'm not sure, but this...

641
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,360
This is a Reynolds, so
that is worth looking at.

642
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,710
And that's quite good, too.

643
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,830
Tell us about these people.

644
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,950
Oh, well, they were all rather marvellous

645
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,120
and sort of living that life.

646
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,870
- It's not very cosy, is it?
- Isn't it?

647
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,560
It is cosy at night, with
the lamps and the fire.

648
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,110
What about the architect?

649
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,680
Sir Charles Barry? Yes, he
built the Houses of Parliament,

650
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,540
or at least he finished them.

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,640
And, you know, he built
lots of lovely big buildings.

652
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,840
No, that's him, I think. Or his son.

653
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,550
Or it might be his father.

654
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,510
Who's the little girl?

655
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,120
Ah, the little girl is a little boy,

656
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,960
but who I could not say. Ah,
Granny, thank God you're here.

657
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,830
What else could I tell
them about the library?

658
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,600
The library was assembled by
the fourth Earl. He loved books.

659
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,680
- What else did he collect?
- Horses and women. Where's your mother?

660
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,600
- She's in the great hall.
- Thank you.

661
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,870
Excuse me please. Thank you.

662
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,860
Why are those shields on
the chimneypiece blank?

663
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,910
Do you know, I've never
really noticed that before.

664
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,790
Isn't that strange? I haven't
a clue is the answer.

665
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,040
Cora!

666
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,630
Excuse me.

667
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,200
Did you know when I was last here?

668
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,470
Mama, I think maybe we should...

669
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,040
Did you know when I was last here?

670
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,000
And you let me babble on about
my victory? Have you told Robert?

671
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,000
- Mama, you of all people don't want
to bore our vis... - Just be quiet.

672
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,960
Excuse me. Hmm. Oh!

673
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,840
- Are you all right? - I was going
to see if Her Ladyship needs anything.

674
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,040
She needs a glass of water and a
fan, if you'd heard what I heard.

675
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,560
- What is it?
- I've had a letter. From Coyle.

676
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,870
- What? - He wants me
to visit him in prison.

677
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,400
Well, don't even answer it. Ignore
it completely. Throw it on the fire.

678
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,350
Mr Molesley, there's no-one
on duty in the library!

679
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,270
Right away, Mr Carson.

680
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,320
Uh...

681
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,870
Daisy, can you relieve me? I
ought to get the tables upstairs.

682
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,280
- What about the sandwiches? - I'll
take them up when I've got the
tables organised. - Oh, tablecloths!

683
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,840
Oh.

684
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,950
You wouldn't believe what happened
up there. In front of everyone.

685
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,870
Oh? Try me.

686
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,520
My son's wife, whom I have
treated like a daughter.

687
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:06,590
- Too like. - That she should
connive at my humiliation,

688
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,230
should revel as I am cast into the dust.

689
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,080
Steady the buffs. Cora doesn't
control this any more than you.

690
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,720
You've had different opinions,
but neither of you made it happen.

691
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,670
If only Mr Chamberlain had spoken...

692
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,590
He was never going to say
a word. The truth is, Mama,

693
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,270
officialdom doesn't care
what we think any more.

694
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,310
Our influence is finished.

695
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,120
You can say that! You, whose
very life has been saved.

696
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,870
You know dealing with
emergencies won't be affected.

697
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,550
- Do be logical.
- I am sick and tired of logic!

698
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,790
If I could choose between
principle and logic,

699
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,320
I'd take principle every time!

700
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,030
Just tell Cora I do not
wish to see her face

701
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,080
until I'm used to having
a traitor in the family!

702
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,040
Why is she in such a tizzy?

703
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,160
Well, you know mothers. They get
terribly wrought up about things.

704
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,590
- My mum does.
- There you are.

705
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,480
Mine does too.

706
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,670
May I ask what you're doing here?

707
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,800
I come to see your house.
With my mum and dad.

708
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,550
Do they know where you are?

709
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,800
- No. Why is it so big, your house?
- I'm not sure, really.

710
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,830
It's the way they used to manage things.

711
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,910
Well, why not buy somewhere comfy?

712
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,560
- You must have enough money.
- Maybe.

713
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,240
But you know how it is. You
like what you're used to.

714
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,390
Why are you in here?

715
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,520
- Wouldn't you like to know!
- Cheeky rascal!

716
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,080
Let him go. No harm done.

717
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,310
Are you sure, My Lord? Shouldn't
we shake out his pockets?

718
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,030
I don't think so.

719
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,520
He was more of a philosopher than a thief.

720
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,240
- So your house is finished?
- Finished and ready to receive my guests.

721
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,830
- And who'll run it day-to-day?
- My niece. My sister's girl.

722
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,990
She's agreed, so I'm all set.

723
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,990
Oh, and how will you attract the visitors?

724
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,990
Put an advertisement in the papers.

725
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,910
But how will they get in touch?

726
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,510
How do you think?

727
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:24,160
- I've installed a telephone in the house.
- Your own telephone?

728
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,080
My, my. You're blazing a trail now.

729
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,350
Have you found anyone
to hit with that yet?

730
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,710
If I had my way, I'd hit the lot of them.

731
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,120
- But it's going all right?
- Well, it seems so.

732
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
- Mr Carson, can I have a word?
- Certainly. - I'll leave you to it.

733
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,430
It's something or nothing.

734
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,080
Only, I'm a bit worried about Andy.

735
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,520
Now, it may be innocent. I'm
not saying I'm infallible.

736
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,080
But he's young, and you ought to know.

737
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,990
Lady Grantham, how nice.

738
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,750
Uh, this is my soon-to-be
daughter in law, Miss Cruikshank.

739
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,630
She was curious to see the Abbey, so I
bought her here to support the opening.

740
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,710
I've already taken her
to meet Mrs Crawley.

741
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,670
What did your fiance say to that?

742
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,720
Forgive me, but I think there's
been a misunderstanding.

743
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,830
- Larry isn't Mrs Crawley's enemy. - No?

744
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,990
He gives a marvellous impression of it.

745
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,080
Please tell Mrs Crawley when you
see her that I am her friend.

746
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,510
I would never want to stand in
her way. And nor will Larry.

747
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,630
I promise. Not while I'm around.

748
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,760
- Oh, yes, very interesting.
- Oh, interesting and encouraging.

749
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,510
Yes, I'll leave it at interesting for now.

750
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,550
Good day to you both.

751
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,560
Mama, can I speak to you?

752
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,600
No, you may not.

753
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,550
- Is dinner finished?
- It is.

754
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,710
They've had coffee taken up
to Her Ladyship's bedroom,

755
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,900
so they don't want us there.

756
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,960
What a day.

757
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:02,680
- I hope you've thrown away that letter.
- No, not yet.

758
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,760
I think you should.

759
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,390
- I don't know. I have to think.
- Think about what?

760
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,870
Nothing that would interest you.

761
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,990
You don't know what might interest me.

762
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,520
Well, that's rather what I
want to talk about, Mr Barrow.

763
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,350
Do you want us to leave
you to it, Mr Carson?

764
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,270
If you wouldn't mind.

765
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,510
I hope you're not planning
to hit me with that.

766
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,600
No. But I will not beat about
the bush either, Mr Barrow.

767
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,990
Someone has reported that you seem

768
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,840
to have a private
understanding with Andrew.

769
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,630
Not this again.

770
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,390
I might not have given it
much mind, but I was upstairs

771
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,150
last night quite late, and
I saw him leave your room.

772
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,830
Mr Carson, how long do I have
to work in this house before

773
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,190
- I am given any credit?
- That is all very well,

774
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,230
but we are talking about
a vulnerable young man,

775
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,150
- and I must look to his welfare.
- Yes. And if I were to give you

776
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,440
my word of honour that nothing took
place of which you would disapprove?

777
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,460
If I could just be sure.

778
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,040
So my word is still not good enough,
Mr Carson, after so many years?

779
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,880
I only wish it were.

780
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,320
Golly, Moses. You astound me.

781
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,750
- And all from the sale of tickets?
- It's a great deal of money.

782
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,430
I don't suppose we could open
the house on a regular basis?

783
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,390
- For charity, you mean?
- No, for us.

784
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,760
The house costs money to run, and
at the moment, it doesn't raise a
penny for washing its own face.

785
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,030
Tell me you're not being serious, Tom.

786
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,830
To charge money so people can come and snoop
around our home? What a revolting suggestion.

787
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,590
- It is rather a frightful idea.
- All right.

788
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,150
There may come a day when we
simply can't ignore such a large
source of income at our fingertips.

789
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,030
- Hopefully when I am dust.
- Still, Tom and Isobel were right.

790
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,630
People are curious about
what it's like to live here.

791
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,470
Which is sad in a way.

792
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,350
- Why? - Because it means our way
of life is something strange,

793
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,030
something to queue up
and buy a ticket to see,

794
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,350
a museum exhibit, a fat
lady in the circus.

795
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,550
Trust you to cast a pall of
doom over our successful day.

796
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,150
I had a visitor, a child
who'd escaped his mother.

797
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,950
He thought we were mad to live here

798
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,920
- when we could be so comfy in a normal house.
- Oh, I refuse to listen.

799
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,830
Downton Abbey is where
the Crawleys belong.

800
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,950
I hope we'll stay as long as we can.

801
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,270
- But I suppose we all realise it may not
last forever. - Oh, this is weakling talk.

802
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,830
George and I are made of sterner
stuff than the lot of you.

803
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,920
- That, I'm sure, is quite true.
- And we are not going anywhere.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
